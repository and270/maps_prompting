See the examples below to guide you on how your answer format should be:

Q: If John has 3 apples and buys 2 more, how many apples does he have now?
A: Let's think step by step.
John starts with 3 apples.
He buys 2 more apples.
So, the total number of apples is 3 + 2 = 5.
The answer is 5.

Q: Sarah had 10 candies. She gave 4 to her friend. How many candies does she have left?
A: Let's think step by step.
Sarah starts with 10 candies.
She gives 4 candies to her friend.
So, the number of candies left is 10 - 4 = 6.
The answer is 6.

Q: There are 5 baskets, each with 3 oranges. How many oranges are there in total?
A: Let's think step by step.
Each basket has 3 oranges.
There are 5 baskets.
So, the total number of oranges is 5 * 3 = 15.
The answer is 15.

Q: A baker has 24 cupcakes and packs them equally into 6 boxes. How many cupcakes are in each box?
A: Let's think step by step.
The baker has 24 cupcakes.
He packs them into 6 boxes equally.
So, each box contains 24 / 6 = 4 cupcakes.
The answer is 4.

Q: Emily read 7 pages of a book on Monday and 9 pages on Tuesday. How many pages did she read in total?
A: Let's think step by step.
Emily read 7 pages on Monday.
She read 9 pages on Tuesday.
So, the total number of pages read is 7 + 9 = 16.
The answer is 16.

Q: Tom had 15 marbles. He lost 7 of them. How many marbles does he have now?
A: Let's think step by step.
Tom starts with 15 marbles.
He loses 7 marbles.
So, the number of marbles left is 15 - 7 = 8.
The answer is 8.

Q: There are 4 packs of pencils, each containing 6 pencils. How many pencils are there in total?
A: Let's think step by step.
Each pack contains 6 pencils.
There are 4 packs.
So, the total number of pencils is 4 * 6 = 24.
The answer is 24.

Q: A gardener has 36 flowers and plants them equally in 9 rows. How many flowers are in each row?
A: Let's think step by step.
The gardener has 36 flowers.
He plants them equally in 9 rows.
So, each row contains 36 / 9 = 4 flowers.
The answer is 4.

You have incorrectly answered the following question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific.
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).
[Example Input]
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city
where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters
contained in the name of the state?
Answer:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
The answer is 32
---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names.
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic.
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Arithmetic error
- Multiplication error
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together,
not adding them.
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
The answer is 16

Your task is to modify the Self-Reflection template so that it is as specific and helpful as possible for the problem. Focus on aspects such as:

*   **Type of problem:** The Self-Reflection prompt should guide the model to solve the specific type of problem presented in the question.
*   **Common mistakes:** The Self-Reflection prompt should guide the model to identify the common mistakes that are made when solving this type of problem.
*   **Complexity of the problem:** The Self-Reflection prompt should guide the model to try to understand the complexity of the problem, if more steps arte needed to solve it.

Here is the original Self-Reflection template that you should adapt:
