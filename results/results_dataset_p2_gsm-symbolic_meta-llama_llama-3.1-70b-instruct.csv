p2,gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"Sophia went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, and 60 mini cheesecakes. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,"To determine the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Find the cost of donuts:
   Since Sophia bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, first, find the number of dozens of donuts she bought.
   Number of dozens of donuts = 60 / 12 = 5
   Cost of donuts = 5 * $19 = $95

2. Find the cost of mini cupcakes:
   Since Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, first, find the number of dozens of mini cupcakes she bought.
   Number of dozens of mini cupcakes = 60 / 12 = 5
   Cost of mini cupcakes = 5 * $33 = $165

3. The total cost before the discount is the sum of the costs of donuts and mini cupcakes plus the cost of the mini cheesecakes. We'll call the cost of the mini cheesecakes X.
   Total cost before discount = $95 + $165 + X
   Since Sophia received a 20% discount, we need to find 100% of the total cost (original price), which is given by this formula:
   Original price = Discounted price / (1 - Discount%)
   Original price = $1500 / 0.8 (1 - 0.2 = 0.8)
   Original price = $1875

4. The cost of the mini cheesecakes can now be found:
   $1875 = $95 + $165 + X
   $1875 = $260 + X
   X = $1875 - $260
   X = $1615
   Since X is the cost of 5 dozens of mini cheesecakes (60 / 12 = 5 dozens of mini cheesecakes), find the cost per dozen:
   Cost per dozen = $1615 / 5
   Cost per dozen = $323

So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen was $323.",323.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes before the discount.

The cost of 60 donuts is 60 / 12 = 5 dozen donuts. The cost of 5 dozen donuts is 5 * $19 = $95.

The cost of 60 mini cupcakes is 60 / 12 = 5 dozen mini cupcakes. The cost of 5 dozen mini cupcakes is 5 * $33 = $165.

The total cost of donuts and mini cupcakes is $95 + $165 = $260.

Since Sophia paid a total of $1500 after a 20% discount, the total cost before the discount is $1500 / 0.8 = $1875.

The cost of the mini cheesecakes is the difference between the total cost before the discount and the cost of donuts and mini cupcakes. So, the cost of mini cheesecakes is $1875 - $260 = $1615.

Since Sophia bought 60 mini cheesecakes, the number of dozen mini cheesecakes is 60 / 12 = 5 dozen.

The cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is $1615 / 5 = $323.

The answer is $323.",323.0,1,0,1,323.0,,,
p2,gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving. A 300 grams bag has 6 servings. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?",350.0,"To find the answer, we first need to calculate how many calories Hiroshi and Tara can consume daily.

Hiroshi's daily calorie target: 15 calories/lb * 220 lb = 3300 calories
Tara's daily calorie target: 15 calories/lb * 140 lb = 2100 calories

Next, we need to calculate how many calories Hiroshi and Tara have already consumed and burned.

Hiroshi's calories already consumed: 1100 calories
Hiroshi's calories burned: 200 calories
Hiroshi's remaining calories: 3300 - 1100 + 200 = 2400 calories

Tara's total calories already consumed: 900 + 200 = 1100 calories
Tara's remaining calories: 2100 - 1100 = 1000 calories

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in a gram of the popcorn:
Total grams = 300 grams, total calories = 6 servings * 200 calories/serving = 1200 calories
Calories per gram = Total calories / Total grams = 1200 / 300 = 4 calories/gram.

Since both Hiroshi and Tara can only eat the popcorn without going over their daily calorie target, Hiroshi can eat: 2400 calories / 4 calories/gram = 600 grams. 
Tara can eat: 1000 calories / 4 calories/gram = 250 grams.

To find the difference in grams of popcorn, we subtract Tara's grams from Hiroshi's grams: 600 - 250 = 350 grams.

Hiroshi needs to consume 350 grams more than Tara.",350.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories Hiroshi and Tara can consume in a day. 
Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, so his daily calorie target is 220 * 15 = 3300 calories.
Tara weighs 140 lbs, so her daily calorie target is 140 * 15 = 2100 calories.

Next, we need to find out how many calories Hiroshi and Tara have already consumed.
Hiroshi has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise, so the net calories he has consumed is 1100 - 200 = 900 calories.
Tara has already consumed 900 calories in food and 200 calories in ice cream, so the total calories she has consumed is 900 + 200 = 1100 calories.

Now, we need to find out how many calories Hiroshi and Tara can still consume.
Hiroshi can still consume 3300 - 900 = 2400 calories.
Tara can still consume 2100 - 1100 = 1000 calories.

Since a serving of popcorn has 200 calories, we need to find out how many servings Hiroshi and Tara can still consume.
Hiroshi can still consume 2400 / 200 = 12 servings.
Tara can still consume 1000 / 200 = 5 servings.

Since a 300 grams bag has 6 servings, we need to find out how many grams of popcorn Hiroshi and Tara can still consume.
Hiroshi can still consume 12 / 6 = 2 bags of popcorn, which is 2 * 300 = 600 grams.
Tara can still consume 5 / 6 = 0.83 bags of popcorn, which is 0.83 * 300 = 250 grams.

Finally, we need to find out how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara.
Hiroshi needs to consume 600 - 250 = 350 grams more than Tara.

Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Daphne remain with?",335.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of potted plants Daphne already has**

Daphne has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges, so:

8 plants/ledge × 56 ledges = 8 × 56 = 448 plants

**Step 2: Add the 23 new potted plants Daphne received two days ago**

448 plants + 23 plants = 471 plants

**Step 3: Calculate the number of new plants Daphne purchased yesterday**

Daphne purchased 200 new plants at a 50% discount, but the discount doesn't affect the number of plants, so:

200 plants

**Step 4: Add the new plants purchased yesterday to the total**

471 plants + 200 plants = 671 plants

**Step 5: Calculate the number of plants Daphne will give away tomorrow**

Daphne will give away 6 potted plants from each of the 56 window ledges, so:

6 plants/ledge × 56 ledges = 6 × 56 = 336 plants

**Step 6: Subtract the number of plants Daphne will give away from the total**

671 plants - 336 plants = 335 plants

She received 23 new potted plants two days ago.
She also purchased 200 new plants at a 50% discount yesterday, but the discount does not affect the total number of plants. She bought 200 plants.
So, the total number of plants before giving any to friends and family is 448 + 23 + 200 = 671.
Daphne will give away 6 potted plants from each ledge tomorrow, so she will give away a total of 6 * 56 = 336 plants.

p2,gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 60 minutes to cover every 4 miles of the city. However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the fog bank covers the city and adjust it for the change in wind speed.

Initially, the fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes. So, the rate at which it covers the city is 4 miles / 60 minutes = 1/15 miles per minute.

However, we know that the wind speed will be halved in 1 hour, which means the rate at which the fog bank covers the city will also be halved. After 1 hour, the rate will be (1/15) / 2 = 1/30 miles per minute.

Since we are interested in the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, and the city is 80 miles across, 1/4 of the city is 80 / 4 = 20 miles.

Let's break this into two parts: covering 20 miles at the initial rate and then adjusting the time for the wind change.

It takes 4 miles / (1/15 miles/minute) = 60 minutes, for 4 miles so we multiply by 5: 20 miles / (1/15 miles/minute) = 20 * 15 = 300 minutes to cover 20 miles at the initial rate. However, in 60 minutes (1 hour), the wind speed will be halved. 

In the first hour, the distance covered will be 60 minutes * (1/15 miles/minute) = 4 miles.

The remaining distance is 20 - 4 = 16 miles.

The remaining time for 16 miles with the new wind speed (1/30 miles/minute) is 16 / (1/30) = 480 minutes. To find total time we add the 60 minutes to the 480 minutes to get 540.",540.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes.
We need to find out how many minutes it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, which is 1/4 of 80 miles.
First, let's calculate 1/4 of 80 miles: 80 / 4 = 20 miles.
Since the fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to cover 20 miles by multiplying the time by 5 (since 20 miles is 5 times 4 miles).
So, the time it takes to cover 20 miles is 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.
However, we are told that the wind speed will be halved in one hour, which means the fog bank will move at half the speed after 60 minutes.
Since we are interested in the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, which is 20 miles, and the fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, it will cover 4 miles in the first 60 minutes.
After that, the wind speed will be halved, and it will take longer to cover the remaining 16 miles.
But we are only interested in the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, which is 20 miles, and we already calculated that it would take 300 minutes at the original speed.
Since the wind speed is halved after 60 minutes, the fog bank will cover 4 miles in the first 60 minutes, and then it will take longer to cover the remaining 16 miles.
However, we can calculate the time it takes to cover the remaining 16 miles at the original speed, which is 16 / 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.
Since the wind speed is halved, it will take twice as long to cover the remaining 16 miles, so we add 240 minutes to the initial 60 minutes.
The answer is 60 + 240 = 300 minutes.

I answered the question incorrectly because I did not consider the change in wind speed, which affects the rate at which the fog bank covers the city. I assumed a constant rate throughout the problem.

**Keywords describing the error from most general to most specific**

1. Lack of consideration of changing conditions
2. Incorrect assumption of constant rate
3. Failure to account for change in wind speed

**Correct solution**

Step 1: Calculate the initial rate at which the fog bank covers the city.
60 minutes / 4 miles = 15 minutes/mile

Step 2: Determine the new rate after the wind speed is halved in 1 hour.
Since the wind speed is halved, the new rate will be twice as slow. So, the new rate = 2 * 15 minutes/mile = 30 minutes/mile

Step 3: Calculate the distance the fog bank needs to cover to cover 1/4 of the city.
1/4 of 80 miles = 20 miles

Step 4: Determine how much time it will take to cover 20 miles at the initial rate of 15 minutes/mile and at the new rate of 30 minutes/mile after 1 hour. We can cut the problem into two parts, the first hour and the subsequent 4 miles (time * initial rate = distance), and the remainder distance.
Distance covered in the first hour at 15 minutes/mile = 4 miles.
Time to cover the remaining 16 miles = 16 miles * 30 minutes/mile = 480 minutes.
Time to cover 4 miles in the first hour = 60 minutes.
Total time for 1/4 of the city = 60 minutes + 480 minutes = 540 minutes

*Much of this distance will be covered before the winds halve and the speed does slow*

However, the winds will halve at the 1-hour point when a single 4-mile point has been covered. The speed, over the next set of 4 miles it is covering, will gradually decline rather than immediately switch to half the speeds.
We can find the remainder of time taken between mile 4 and when it reaches 20 miles as follows:
  if we let *K be equal to remaining time taken to cover the 16 miles so the expression for the K is
K=(20-X)/rate = distance / rate
r+(t-dist/r)....solution)

Wrong Answer: I calculated the time it would take to fill the tank without considering the effect of the leak. I simply divided the capacity of the tank by the fill rate, resulting in an incorrect answer.

Explanation:
I failed to account for the rate at which the tank is losing water, which affects the overall rate at which the tank is being filled.

Error Keywords:
- Ignoring the effect of the leak
- Incorrect application of rates of change
- Failure to consider proportional reasoning

Instructions:
1. Identify the rates of change involved in the problem (e.g., fill rate, leak rate).
2. Determine how the rates of change affect the overall rate at which the tank is being filled.
3. Use proportional reasoning to calculate the time it would take to fill the desired portion of the tank.

Advice:
- Always consider multiple rates of change when solving problems involving rates of change.
- Use proportional reasoning to account for the effects of multiple rates of change.
- Break down complex problems into simpler components to ensure accurate calculations.

Solution:
To solve the example problem, I would first calculate the net fill rate by subtracting the leak rate from the fill rate. Then, I would use proportional reasoning to calculate the time it would take to fill 1/3 of the tank.

I answered the question incorrectly because I failed to account for the change in wind speed over time. I treated the wind speed as constant, which led to an incorrect calculation of the time it would take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city.

**Error Keywords**

* Ignoring the effect of changing wind speed
* Incorrect application of rates of change
* Failure to consider proportional reasoning
* Inadequate consideration of time-dependent variables

**Step-by-Step Solution**

1. First, let's calculate the initial rate at which the fog bank covers the city. It takes 60 minutes to cover 4 miles, so the initial rate is 4 miles / 60 minutes = 1/15 miles per minute.
2. Since the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour, we need to calculate the new rate at which the fog bank will cover the city after one hour. If the wind speed is halved, the rate at which the fog bank covers the city will also be halved. So, the new rate will be 1/2 \* 1/15 miles per minute = 1/30 miles per minute.
3. Since we want to find the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, we need to calculate the distance that corresponds to 1/4 of the city. The city is 80 miles across, so 1/4 of the city is 80 miles \* 1/4 = 20 miles.
4. To calculate the time it takes to cover 20 miles, we need to consider the changing rate of the fog bank. We can break this down into two parts: the time it takes to cover the first 4 miles (at the initial rate) and the time it takes to cover the remaining 16 miles (at the new rate).
5. Time to cover the first 4 miles = 4 miles / (1/15 miles per minute) = 60 minutes.
6. Time to cover the remaining 16 miles = 16 miles / (1/30 miles per minute) = 480 minutes.
7. Total time = 60 minutes + 480 minutes = 540 minutes.

**Instructions for Correct Solution**

1. Identify the initial rate at which the fog bank covers the city.
2. Determine how the wind speed change affects the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.
3. Calculate the new rate at which the fog bank will cover the city after the wind speed change.
4. Calculate the distance that corresponds to 1/4 of the city.
5. Break down the problem into two parts: the time it takes to cover the initial distance (at the initial rate) and the time it takes to cover the remaining distance (at the new rate).
6. Calculate the time it takes to cover each part and add them together to get the total time.

**General Advice**

* Always consider time-dependent variables when solving problems involving rates of change.
* Break down complex problems into simpler components to ensure accurate calculations.
* Use proportional reasoning to account for changes in rates of change over time.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure that you have accounted for all relevant factors.","Here is the adapted Self-Reflection prompt for the given question:

p2,gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"Santiago watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Tuesday and Wednesday, he watched 4-hour episodes of his favorite show each night. On Thursday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. On Friday, he finished homework early and watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 2-hour episodes. On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?",6.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Santiago watched a total of 20 hours of TV. We'll convert all the times to hours to make it easier to work with.

Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 nights x 4 hours/night = 8 hours
Thursday: unknown number of 15-minute episodes (we'll call this x)
Friday: 3 hours + 45 minutes = 3.75 hours
Saturday: 3 x 2 hours = 6 hours
Sunday: 3 x 15 minutes = 0.75 hours (since 15 minutes is 0.25 hours)

Now, let's add up the hours we know:
8 hours + 3.75 hours + 6 hours + 0.75 hours = 18.5 hours

We know that Santiago watched a total of 20 hours of TV, so the number of hours he watched on Thursday is:
20 hours - 18.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Thursday is 15 minutes, or 0.25 hours, we can divide the total hours by the length of each episode to find the number of episodes:
1.5 hours / 0.25 hours/episode = 6 episodes

So, Santiago watched 6 episodes of the 15-minute show on Thursday.",15.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

We know that Santiago watched a total of 20 hours of TV.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, he watched 4-hour episodes each night, so that's 4 + 4 = 8 hours.

On Friday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. We need to convert the 45-minute show to hours, which is 45/60 = 0.75 hours. So, on Friday, he watched 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.

On Saturday, he watched three 2-hour episodes, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours we know: 8 + 3.75 + 6 = 17.75 hours.

We know that Santiago watched a total of 20 hours of TV, so the hours he watched on Thursday and Sunday are 20 - 17.75 = 2.25 hours.

On Sunday, he watched three 15-minute episodes, which is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes or 0.75 hours.

So, the hours he watched on Thursday are 2.25 - 0.75 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Thursday is 15 minutes or 0.25 hours, the number of episodes he watched on Thursday is 1.5 / 0.25 = 6.

The answer is 6.",6.0,1,0,1,6.0,,,
p2,gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"Nia makes tea using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 54:27. She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, and uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given ratios and the total amount of ingredients used.

Let's start by setting up the ratios:

Teaspoons of sugar : Cups of water = 54 : 27
Teaspoons of sugar : Tablespoons of cream = 1 : 2
Cups of water : Tablespoons of milk = 8 : 8

We can simplify the ratios to make them easier to work with:

Teaspoons of sugar : Cups of water = 2 : 1
Teaspoons of sugar : Tablespoons of cream = 1 : 2
Cups of water : Tablespoons of milk = 1 : 1

Now, let's say the number of teaspoons of sugar is 2x. Then, the number of cups of water is x, the number of tablespoons of cream is 2(2x) = 4x, and the number of tablespoons of milk is x.

The total amount of ingredients used is 240, so we can set up the equation:

2x + x + 4x + x = 240

Combine like terms:

8x = 240

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 30

Now that we know x, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar:

Teaspoons of sugar = 2x
= 2(30)
= 60

So, Nia used 60 teaspoons of sugar.",60.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
We know the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 54:27.
Simplifying the ratio, we get 2:1.
This means for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, 1 cup of water is used.
Also, 8 tablespoons of milk are used for every 8 cups of water.
Since 8 cups of water require 2*4 = 8 teaspoons of sugar (using the 2:1 ratio), 
and 2 tablespoons of heavy cream are used for every teaspoon of sugar,
and a combination of 8 teaspoons of sugar, 8 cups of water, 8 tablespoons of milk, and 16 tablespoons of cream is used, we can assume that this combination requires a total of 8 + 8 + 8 + 16 = 40 teaspoons/cups/tablespoons of these ingredients.
The ratio of total ingredients to sugar used is 40:8.
Now, multiplying this ratio by a factor 'x', we get (40x, 8x), where the total ingredients and teaspoons of sugar are the result.
We know the total was 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk.
Setting up an equation for this: 40x = 240.
To find x, we divide both sides by 40: x = 240 / 40 = 6.
Now, we multiply the value of 'x' times the amount of teaspoons of sugar to express this (sugar).
Multiplying 8 times 'x' gives us: 8x = 8 * 6 = 48.
The answer is 48.",48.0,0,1,1,60.0,"Here's an adapted Self-Reflection prompt for a model trying to solve a mathematical problem similar to the given question.

For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).


[Example Input]
Question: Tom makes a fruit salad using a ratio of 3:2:1 for apples, oranges, and pineapples. If he used a total of 50 fruits and used 10 more apples than intended, how many pineapples did he use?

Wrong answer: Since Tom used 10 more apples, I will just subtract 10 from the total number of fruits to get the correct number of fruits. Let's say there were 40 fruits (50 - 10). Now, the ratio is 3:2:1, so I will divide 40 by 6 (3+2+1) and then multiply it by 1 to get the number of pineapples, which is 6 * 1 = 6 + 10 = 16 pineapples.


[Example Output]
Explanation:
I did not properly adjust the ratio to reflect the addition of apples and ignored the original total number of fruits.


Error Keywords:
- Incorrect ratio adjustment
- Misunderstanding the total number of fruits
- Lack of proportion understanding


Instructions to solve the example:
- First, calculate the total parts of the ratio and set up an equation for the total number of fruits.
- Next, solve the equation to find the value of one part of the ratio.
- Then, calculate the correct number of pineapples by multiplying the value of one part by the corresponding part of the ratio for pineapples.
- Finally, check your answer to ensure it aligns with the given information.


Advice for solving similar problems:
- Always adjust the ratio when the number of one component changes.
- Pay attention to the original total number of parts or components.
- Check your answer for logical coherence.


Solution to the example:
First, let's define the ratio in terms of a common multiplier: 3x, 2x, and 1x. We know that 3x + 2x + 1x = 50 - 10 (3x + 2x + 1x = 40). Next, solve for x: 6x = 40, so x = 40 / 6. Now calculate the number of pineapples: x * 1 = (40/6) * 1, which simplifies to 40 / 6 = 6.67, so we can see that we need to recalculate the problem, knowing that the total was 50 fruits (5x + 6x + 3x = 50, and 3x + 2x + 1x + 9x = 14x = 50 + 10, 14x = 60)

Now, look at this question:
Question: Nia makes tea using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 54:27. She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, and uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","Explanation:
I did not accurately consider the additional ingredients (milk and cream) and their impact on the total number of components. I also failed to properly adjust the ratio of sugar to water and calculate the correct proportion of sugar used.

Error Keywords:
- Inadequate consideration of additional components
- Incorrect adjustment of the sugar-to-water ratio
- Misunderstanding of the total number of components
- Failure to apply proportion correctly

Instructions to solve the example:
- First, identify all the components involved and their respective ratios.
- Next, set up an equation that accounts for the total number of components.
- Then, express each component in terms of a common multiplier based on the given ratios.
- After that, solve for the value of the common multiplier.
- Finally, calculate the correct amount of the desired component (teaspoons of sugar) using the value of the common multiplier.

Advice for solving similar problems:
- Always consider all the components involved in the problem.
- Properly adjust the ratios to reflect the relationships between components.
- Ensure the total number of components is accurately accounted for in the equation.
- Use proportion to solve for the desired component.

Solution to the example:
First, let's define the ratios for each component in terms of a common multiplier:
- Sugar: 54x
- Water: 27x
- Milk: 8y (for every 8 cups of water, so 27x = 8y)
- Cream: 2z (for every teaspoon of sugar, so 54x = 2z)

We can simplify the milk and cream ratios to:
- Milk: 27x (since 8y = 27x)
- Cream: 108x (since 2z = 54x and z = 27x)

Now, set up an equation for the total number of components:
54x + 27x + 27x + 108x = 240
Combine like terms:
216x = 240

Solve for x:
x = 240 / 216
x = 10/9
x = 1.11 (approximately)

Now, calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar:
54x = 54 * (10/9)
= 60 * (1.11)
= 60","Here's an adapted Self-Reflection prompt for a model trying to solve a mathematical problem similar to the given question.

1. Aisha initially bought a package of x forks (we don't know the number yet).
2. Her husband bought a package of 8 forks and gave it to her. So, now she has x + 8 forks.
3. She used 16 forks to sample her stuffed peppers. So, now she has x + 8 - 16 = x - 8 forks.
4. She threw away 6 defective forks. So, now she has x - 8 - 6 = x - 14 forks.
5. The guests brought 2 packs of forks, each having 6 inside them. So, they brought a total of 2 x 6 = 12 forks.
6. Now, the total number of forks Aisha has is x - 14 + 12 = x - 2.
7. The problem states that when she went to set the table, she had a total of 32 forks.

Question: Tom bought a new set of plates for his restaurant. He already had 15 plates, but he needed more for a catering event. He bought a new set of plates, but his employee broke 4 of them while washing them. Later, Tom's supplier delivered 2 boxes of plates, each containing 8 plates. If Tom now has a total of 35 plates, how many plates were in the new set that Tom bought?

Wrong answer: Tom bought 12 new plates.

Explanation:
I failed to account for the plates that were already present and the plates that were broken.

Error Keywords:
- Multi-step calculation error
- Failure to account for initial quantity
- Failure to account for quantity changes

Instructions:
1. Identify the initial quantity of plates.
2. Calculate the total number of plates after the new set was bought.
3. Subtract the number of broken plates from the total.
4. Add the number of plates delivered by the supplier.
5. Set up an equation to solve for the number of plates in the new set.

Advice:
- Always identify the initial quantity and any changes to the quantity.
- Break down multi-step calculations into smaller, manageable parts.
- Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.

Solution:
Let x be the number of plates in the new set. The total number of plates after the new set was bought is 15 + x. After 4 plates were broken, the total number of plates is 15 + x - 4. After the supplier delivered 2 boxes of plates, each containing 8 plates, the total number of plates is 15 + x - 4 + 16. Since Tom now has a total of 35 plates, we can set up the equation: 15 + x - 4 + 16 = 35. Solving for x, we get x = 8.

**Step-by-Step Solution**

Let x be the number of forks in the package Aisha bought.

1. Aisha bought a new package of forks, so she had x forks.
2. Her husband bought a package of 8 new forks, so the total number of forks is x + 8.
3. Aisha used 16 forks to sample her stuffed peppers, so the total number of forks is x + 8 - 16.
4. She threw away 6 defective forks, so the total number of forks is x + 8 - 16 - 6.
5. The guests brought 2 packs of forks, each having 6 inside them, so the total number of forks is x + 8 - 16 - 6 + 12.

[Example Input]
Question: Tom bought a new set of plates for his restaurant. He already had 15 plates, but he needed more for a catering event. He bought a new set of plates, but his employee broke 4 of them while washing them. Later, Tom's supplier delivered 2 boxes of plates, each containing 8 plates. If Tom now has a total of 35 plates, how many plates were in the new set that Tom bought?

Wrong answer: Tom bought 12 new plates.

Explanation:
I failed to account for the plates that were already present and the plates that were broken.

Error Keywords:
- Multi-step calculation error
- Failure to account for initial quantity
- Failure to account for quantity changes

Instructions:
1. Identify the initial quantity of plates.
2. Calculate the total number of plates after the new set was bought.
3. Subtract the number of broken plates from the total.
4. Add the number of plates delivered by the supplier.
5. Set up an equation to solve for the number of plates in the new set.

Advice:
- Always identify the initial quantity and any changes to the quantity.
- Break down multi-step calculations into smaller, manageable parts.
- Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.

Solution:
Let x be the number of plates in the new set. The total number of plates after the new set was bought is 15 + x. After 4 plates were broken, the total number of plates is 15 + x - 4. After the supplier delivered 2 boxes of plates, each containing 8 plates, the total number of plates is 15 + x - 4 + 16. Since Tom now has a total of 35 plates, we can set up the equation: 15 + x - 4 + 16 = 35. Solving for x, we get x = 8.

Now, reflect on the original question and your incorrect answer.

p2,gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field. There are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard. Ravi can harvest his bananas every 4 months. In addition, Ravi owns a 13-square yard apricot field that produces 12 apricots per square yard. The apricots can be harvested every 4 months. In the span of two years, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?",1764.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of bananas harvested per square yard**

Since there are 36 bananas in four-fifths of a square yard, we can calculate the number of bananas per square yard:

36 bananas / (4/5) square yards = 36 bananas / 0.8 square yards
= 45 bananas per square yard

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of bananas harvested in 2 years**

Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field, and he can harvest bananas every 4 months. Since there are 12 months in a year, Ravi can harvest bananas 3 times a year (12 months / 4 months per harvest = 3 harvests per year).

In 2 years, Ravi can harvest bananas 6 times (3 harvests per year * 2 years = 6 harvests).

The total number of bananas harvested in 2 years is:

45 bananas per square yard * 10 square yards * 6 harvests
= 45 * 10 * 6
= 2700 bananas

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of apricots harvested in 2 years**

Ravi has 13 square yards of apricot field, and he can harvest apricots every 4 months. He can harvest apricots 3 times a year and 6 times in 2 years (just like the banana field).

The total number of apricots harvested in 2 years is:

12 apricots per square yard * 13 square yards * 6 harvests
= 12 * 13 * 6
= 936 apricots

**Step 4: Calculate the difference in the number of bananas and apricots harvested**

To find the difference, we subtract the number of apricots harvested from the number of bananas harvested:

2700 bananas - 936 apricots
= 1764

So, Ravi harvests 1764 more bananas than apricots in 2 years.",2.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Step 1: First, let's calculate the number of bananas Ravi can harvest from his banana field. He has 10 square yards of banana field, and there are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard. 

So, the number of bananas per square yard is 36 / (4/5) = 36 / 0.8 = 45 bananas per square yard.

Step 2: Multiply the bananas per square yard by the total square yards to find the total number of bananas Ravi can harvest in one session. Total bananas per session = 45 bananas/square yard * 10 square yards = 450 bananas.

Step 3: Since Ravi can harvest bananas every 4 months, in 2 years, he can harvest bananas 2 * 12 / 4 = 6 times.

Step 4: Therefore, the total number of bananas Ravi can harvest in 2 years is 450 bananas * 6 = 2700 bananas.

Step 5: Next, let's calculate the number of apricots Ravi can harvest from his apricot field. He has 13 square yards of apricot field, and there are 12 apricots per square yard.

Step 6: Multiply the apricots per square yard by the total square yards to find the total number of apricots Ravi can harvest in one session. Total apricots per session = 12 apricots/square yard * 13 square yards = 156 apricots.

Step 7: Since Ravi can harvest apricots every 4 months, in 2 years, he can harvest apricots 2 * 12 / 4 = 6 times.

Step 8: Therefore, the total number of apricots Ravi can harvest in 2 years is 156 apricots * 6 = 936 apricots.

Step 9: Finally, let's calculate the difference between the total number of bananas and apricots Ravi harvests in 2 years.

So, the difference is 2700 - 936 = 1764.

The answer is 1764.",1764.0,1,0,1,1764.0,,,
p2,gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"Arjun went to buy some school supplies. He bought 12 folders which cost $4.75 each, 8 erasers which cost $14.5 each, and a ream of bond paper which cost $11. He also bought 7 pencils which cost $8 each. Arjun can either pay a one-time $20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases, or not become a member and receive only a 5% discount. What is the least amount Arjun can spend on everything?",212.0,"To find the least amount Arjun can spend on everything, we need to calculate the total cost of the items with both the discount options (20% and 5%), and compare the results.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of each item**

- 12 folders = 12 x $4.75 = $57
- 8 erasers = 8 x $0.145 = $1.16 (erñaser costs have been changed from $14.5 to $0.145, given the plural declaration on the erasers)
- 1 ream of bond paper = $11
- 7 pencils = 7 x $0.80 = $5.60 (pencil costs have been changed from $8 to $0.80, given the pencils declared in plural form cost)

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost without any discount**

Total cost = $57 + $1.16 + $11 + $5.60 = $74.76

**Step 3: Calculate the cost with a 5% discount**

Discount amount = 5% of $74.76 = 0.05 x $74.76 = $3.74
Total cost with 5% discount = $74.76 - $3.74 = $71.02

**Step 4: Calculate the cost with a 20% discount and the membership fee**

Discount amount = 20% of $74.76 = 0.20 x $74.76 = $14.95
Total cost with 20% discount and membership fee = $74.76 - $14.95 + $20 = $79.81

However, the $20 membership fee and 20% discount is not cost effective when compared to the 5% discount of the store.

**Least amount Arjun can spend:** 
The least amount Arjun can spend on everything is $71.02 when applying the 5% discount on his purchases.",5.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
First, we need to calculate the total cost of the school supplies.
Arjun bought 12 folders for $4.75 each, so the total cost for folders is 12 * $4.75 = $57.
He bought 8 erasers for $14.5 each, so the total cost for erasers is 8 * $14.5 = $116.
He bought a ream of bond paper for $11.
He also bought 7 pencils which actually cost $0.08 each on average, but this is not possible since a pencil would cost about a dollar, so if we consider the question this is wrong; however, it was also said pencils cost $8 each which is also not possible. So, the pencils likely cost $0.08 each, but the pencils are actually ""$8 per pack"" of pencils. Thus we are going to use the $8 price and it will be per box of pencils and that contains 'x' pencils so this could make $8 a price of pencils as well.

We will use a simple pack of 8 pencils = $8 (like they use at a store Wal-Mart and this may actually turn out to be realistic, each one costing about $1 each)
Hence, 7 * $8 is actually 7 * $1 which is $7. But he has got 7 boxes of 8 pencils each. That would cost 7 * $8 = 56
The total cost of the supplies is $57 (folders) + $116 (erasers) + $11 (bond paper) + $56 (pencils). This amounts to $240.

Arjun can either pay a one-time $20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases or not become a member and get only a 5% discount.

If Arjun doesn't become a member, he can get a 5% discount on the total cost. So, the discount would be 5% of $240, which is 0.05 * $240 = $12.
The total cost without membership would be $240 - $12 = $228.

If Arjun becomes a member by paying the $20 fee, he can get a 20% discount on the total cost. So, the discount would be 20% of $240, which is 0.20 * $240 = $48.
The total cost with membership would be $240 - $48 + $20 = $212.

Since $212 is less than $228, the least amount Arjun can spend on everything is $212.

The answer is $212.",212.0,1,0,1,212.0,,,
p2,gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"Yusuf is rolling a twenty-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row, than that he rolls four even numbers in a row?",50.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of the two events and then find the difference between them.

Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row

* Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 = 15/20 = 3/4 (since there are 15 numbers greater than 5 on a 20-sided die)
* Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row = (3/4) × (3/4) = 9/16

Event 2: Rolling four even numbers in a row

* Probability of rolling an even number = 10/20 = 1/2 (since there are 10 even numbers on a 20-sided die)
* Probability of rolling four even numbers in a row = (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/16

Now, let's find the difference in percentage points:

* Probability of Event 1 = 9/16 ≈ 56.25%
* Probability of Event 2 = 1/16 ≈ 6.25%
* Difference in percentage points = 56.25% - 6.25% ≈ 50%

So, it is approximately 50 percentage points more likely that Yusuf rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row than that he rolls four even numbers in a row.",5.0,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Yusuf rolls a 20-sided die, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on one roll is:

Number of favorable outcomes (6 to 20) = 15
Total number of possible outcomes = 20
Probability = 15/20 = 3/4 or 75%

To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row, we square the probability:
Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 or 56.25%

Next, we find the probability of rolling an even number on one roll:
Number of favorable outcomes (even numbers 2, 4, 6, ..., 20) = 10
Total number of possible outcomes = 20
Probability = 10/20 = 1/2 or 50%

To find the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row, we raise the probability to the power of 4:
Probability of rolling four even numbers in a row = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16 or 6.25%

Now, we can find the difference in percentage points between the two probabilities:
Difference in percentage points = 56.25% - 6.25% = 50%

Mia then found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. In addition, she saw 24 wasps, and 9 bees. What percentage of animals in the plot were rabbits?",20.0,"To find the percentage of animals that were rabbits, we need to find the total number of animals and the number of rabbits. Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that there were 9 bees.
2. We know that there were 2/3 as many beetles as bees. To find the number of beetles, we can multiply the number of bees by 2/3:

Beetles = (2/3) × 9 = 6

So, there were 6 beetles.

3. We know that there were 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. To find the number of rabbits, we can divide the total number of white animals by 2:

Rabbits = 26 ÷ 2 = 13

So, there were 13 rabbits.

4. We know that there were 24 wasps.

5. Now, let's find the total number of animals:

Total animals = Bees + Beetles + Rabbits + Wasps
= 9 + 6 + 13 + 24
= 52

6. Finally, we can find the percentage of animals that were rabbits:

Percentage of rabbits = (Number of rabbits ÷ Total animals) × 100
= (13 ÷ 52) × 100
= 25%

Therefore, 25% of the animals in the plot were rabbits.",25.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Since there are 9 bees and 2/3 as many beetles as bees, the number of beetles is 2/3 * 9 = 6.
The total number of blue and black insects on the plot is 9 + 6 = 15.
Mia found 26 white animals, and half of them were rabbits, so she saw 26 / 2 = 13 rabbits.
There were 24 wasps.
So, the total number of animals in the plot is 13 rabbits + 15 blue and black insects + 26 white animals and wasps (26 + 24) = 13 + 15 + 50 = 78,  but we should consider  (wasps = 24) then (26 - 13 = 13 the other animals)  9 + 6 + 13 + 13 + 24 = 65
The total is now 65.
So, the total number of animals in the plot is 65.

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?",11000.0,"To find out how much more the total cost will be than Mrs. Lee's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the property.

First, we need to calculate the selling price after the 25% discount.

Selling price of the property: $400,000
Discount: 25% of $400,000 = 0.25 x $400,000 = $100,000
Selling price after discount: $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $300,000 = 0.05 x $300,000 = $15,000
Transfer fee: 12% of $300,000 = 0.12 x $300,000 = $36,000

So, the total cost will be $11,000 more than Mrs. Lee's budget.",11000.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
Mrs. Lee's budget is $340,000.
The selling price of the property is $400,000.
First, we need to calculate the discount on the selling price, which is 25% of $400,000. 
So, the discount is 0.25 * $400,000 = $100,000.
Therefore, the discounted selling price is $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000.
Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price of $400,000. 
So, the brokerage fee is 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.
Then, we need to calculate the transfer fee, which is 12% of the selling price of $400,000. 
So, the transfer fee is 0.12 * $400,000 = $48,000.
Now, we calculate the total cost by adding the discounted selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee.
The total cost is $300,000 + $20,000 + $48,000 = $368,000.
To find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Lee's budget, we subtract $340,000 from the total cost.
The difference is $368,000 - $340,000 = $28,000.
The answer is $28,000.",28000.0,0,1,0,4000.0,"Here is the adapted Self-Reflection prompt for the given question:

You have incorrectly answered the following question.

Question: Tom is planning to buy a new laptop that fits his budget of $1200. He found a laptop with a price tag of $1500. Additionally, he needs to pay a sales tax of 8% of the laptop's price and a shipping fee of 10% of the laptop's price. If Tom can negotiate a 15% discount on the laptop's price, how much more will he need to pay compared to his budget?

Wrong answer: Tom will need to pay $1500 - 15% of $1500 = $1275 for the laptop. Adding the sales tax and shipping fee, the total cost will be $1275 + 8% of $1275 + 10% of $1275 = $1275 + $102 + $127.5 = $1504.5. Since Tom's budget is $1200, he will need to pay $1504.5 - $1200 = $304.5 more.

Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made a calculation error. I did not correctly apply the discount to the selling price, and I also did not update the prices after the discount when calculating the brokerage fee and transfer fee.

**Error Keywords**

* Miscalculation of brokerage fee and transfer fee
* Incorrect application of discount
* Failure to update prices after discount

**Step-by-Step Solution**

1. Calculate the discount: 25% of $400000 = $100000.

3. Realtor fee (5% of $550000):
5% of $550000 = 0.05 × $550000 = $27500
4. Remaining loan amount: $440000
5. Closing cost: $5000
Total costs = $11000 + $27500 + $440000 + $5000 = $491500
6. Initial net proceeds:

So, the legal fees paid by Dr. Brown is 2/100 * 550000 = 11000 dollars.

He also paid a realtor fee of 5% of the selling price.
So, the realtor fees paid by Dr. Brown is 5/100 * 550000 = 27500 dollars.

The total cost for the fees is 11000 + 27500 = 38500 dollars.

Dr. Brown also paid $440000 for the remaining loan amount on the villa, 
and $5000 for closing costs, totaling 440000 + 5000 = 445000 dollars.

So, in total, he paid 38500 to fees and 445000 for the remaining loan and closing costs. Therefore, the total cost is 38500 + 445000 = 483500 dollars.

Dr. Brown's initial profit is the selling price minus all the costs, totaling 550000 - 483500 = 66500 dollars.

He used the net proceeds from selling the villa to invest in stocks.
 
The stocks gained 10% each year for two years.

In the first year, the stocks gained 10% of 66500, which is 1/10 * 66500 = 6650 dollars.

At the souvenir store, fudge was on sale for ""Buy 15 kgs at ₺22 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/4 off."" She scooped up 21 kgs. She also bought a mixed bag of sand dollars for ₺11.0 and 12 postcards that were ₺21.0 each. Priya then donated ₺5 at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Priya have left?",492.0,"To calculate how much money Priya has left, we need to find out how much she spent in total. 

1. The cost of fudge: 
   - First, we calculate the cost of the 15 kgs at the full price of ₺22 per kg: 
     15 * 22 = 330.
   - Next, we calculate the cost of the 4 kgs with a 1/4 discount. 
     One kg at full price is ₺22, a 1/4 discount is 22 / 4 = 5.5, so with a discount it is,
     22 - 5.5 = 16.5.
   - The cost of 4 kgs with a discount is: 
     16.5 * 4 = 66.
   - Then we add the cost of 15 kgs and 4 kgs (with a 1/4 discount each) along with the remaining 2 kgs which cost the normal price of 2 * 22 = 44: 
     330 + 66 + 44 = 440.

2. The cost of a mixed bag of sand dollars:
    ₺11.0.

3. The cost of the postcards:
    12 * 21 = 252.

4. The charity donation:
    ₺5.

Now let's find the total amount Priya spent:
   440 + 11 + 252 + 5 = 708.

Since Priya initially had ₺1200, her remaining amount is:
   1200 - 708 = ₺492.

Therefore, Priya has ₺492 left.",492.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Priya starts with ₺1200.

She buys 21 kgs of fudge, but the sale is for 15 kgs at ₺22 per kg, and 4 kgs at 1/4 off. To calculate the cost of the fudge, we need to break it down:
- The first 15 kgs cost 15 * ₺22 = ₺330.
- The next 4 kgs are 1/4 off, so they cost 4 * ₺22 * 3/4 = 4 * ₺16.5 = ₺66.
- The remaining 2 kgs (21 - 15 - 4 = 2) cost 2 * ₺22 = ₺44.
So, the total cost of the fudge is ₺330 + ₺66 + ₺44 = ₺440.

She also buys a mixed bag of sand dollars for ₺11.0.

She buys 12 postcards that are ₺21.0 each, so the total cost of the postcards is 12 * ₺21.0 = ₺252.0.

The total cost of the items she bought is ₺440 + ₺11.0 + ₺252.0 = ₺703.0.

She donates ₺5 at a charity stand.

So, the total amount she spent is ₺703.0 + ₺5 = ₺708.0.

The amount of money Priya has left is ₺1200 - ₺708.0 = ₺492.0.

Jamal's dog had 23 puppies with spots. We also know that half of the unspotted puppies were actually spotted. Since Jamal's dog had 131 puppies, the number of unspotted puppies is:
131 - 23 = 108.

Half of these unspotted puppies are actually spotted:
108 / 2 = 54.

So Jamal's dog actually had:
23 + 54 = 77

Gabriel's dog had 13 puppies with spots.

Yuki has 54 dogs, each having 13 puppies with spots, for a total of 54 * 13 = 702 puppies with spots.

Since the farmer has three trucks, and each truck can carry 160 kg, the total weight the three trucks can carry in one trip is:
3 trucks * 160 kg/truck = 480 kg

So, the total weight of cucumbers is 12 * 6 = 72 kg.

He buys 34 packs of hay, each weighing 39 kg.

Later, Uma saw another 10-foot shark with 6 remoras, each 8 inches long, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?",45.0,"To find the average percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each shark and then divide it by the shark's body length.

**Shark 1: 40-foot shark**

Initially, there were 18 remoras, each 16 inches long. To find the total length of the remoras, we multiply the number of remoras by their length:

18 remoras × 16 inches/remora = 288 inches

Since 1/6 of the remoras swam away, we need to subtract 1/6 of the total length:

288 inches - (1/6) × 288 inches = 288 inches - 48 inches = 240 inches

Now, we convert the shark's body length from feet to inches:

40 feet × 12 inches/foot = 480 inches

To find the percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras, we divide the total length of the remoras by the shark's body length and multiply by 100:

(240 inches ÷ 480 inches) × 100% ≈ 50%

**Shark 2: 10-foot shark**

There are 6 remoras, each 8 inches long. To find the total length of the remoras, we multiply the number of remoras by their length:

6 remoras × 8 inches/remora = 48 inches

We convert the shark's body length from feet to inches:

10 feet × 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

To find the percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras, we divide the total length of the remoras by the shark's body length and multiply by 100:

(48 inches ÷ 120 inches) × 100% ≈ 40%

**Average percentage**

To find the average percentage, we add the percentages for both sharks and divide by 2:

(50% + 40%) ÷ 2 = 90% ÷ 2 = 45%

So, on average, approximately 45% of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras.",45.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the total length of the remoras attached to the 40-foot shark. There are 18 remoras, each 16 inches long. We need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet, since the shark's length is given in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

16 inches / 12 = 1.33 feet (per remora)

Now, we can find the total length of the remoras:

18 remoras * 1.33 feet/remora = 24 feet

However, 1/6 of the remoras swam away, so we need to subtract 1/6 of the total length:

24 feet * 1/6 = 4 feet

So, the remaining remoras cover a total length of:

24 feet - 4 feet = 20 feet

Now, let's find the percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras:

(20 feet / 40 feet) * 100% = 50%

Next, we need to find the total length of the remoras attached to the 10-foot shark. There are 6 remoras, each 8 inches long. Again, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet:

8 inches / 12 = 0.67 feet (per remora)

Now, we can find the total length of the remoras:

6 remoras * 0.67 feet/remora = 4 feet

Now, let's find the percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras:

(4 feet / 10 feet) * 100% = 40%

1. Calculate the total capacity of the tables and bowls Carlos has initially.
   - Each bowl can hold 24 almonds. 
   - Each table can hold 3 times that, so each table can hold 24 * 3 = 72 almonds.
   - Carlos has 7 bowls, so the total capacity of the bowls is 7 * 24 = 168 almonds.
   - Carlos has 3 tables, so the total capacity of the tables is 3 * 72 = 216 almonds.
   - Total capacity is 168 + 216 = 384 almonds.

2. Calculate the total capacity after 2 tables break.
   - 2 tables break, so we subtract the capacity of 2 tables from the total capacity of the tables.
   - The capacity of 2 tables is 2 * 72 = 144 almonds.
   - The new total capacity of the tables is 216 - 144 = 72 almonds.

The store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs; any additional rice is sold at the regular price. Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2. How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,"To find out how much Mohammed has to pay, we need to calculate the total cost of the rice and add the cost of the bagel.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice Mohammed needs to buy for a week.
Mohammed uses 3 kgs of rice per day, so for a week (7 days), he needs:
3 kgs/day x 7 days = 21 kgs

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice per kg.
The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more.
20% of ¥15 = ¥15 x 0.20 = ¥3
So, the more expensive brand costs ¥15 + ¥3 = ¥18 per kg.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the rice before the discount.
Mohammed needs 21 kgs of rice, but the discount only applies up to 10 kgs. So, we need to calculate the cost of the first 10 kgs and the additional 11 kgs separately.
Cost of the first 10 kgs = 10 kgs x ¥18/kg = ¥180
Cost of the additional 11 kgs = 11 kgs x ¥18/kg = ¥198
Total cost of the rice before the discount = ¥180 + ¥198 = ¥378

Step 4: Calculate the discount on the first 10 kgs of rice.
The store has a 40% discount on rice up to 10 kgs.
Discount on the first 10 kgs = ¥180 x 0.40 = ¥72

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the rice after the discount.
Total cost of the rice after the discount = Total cost of the rice before the discount - Discount on the first 10 kgs

= ¥306

Step 6: Add the cost of the bagel to the total cost of the rice.
Total amount Mohammed has to pay = Total cost of the rice after the discount + Cost of the bagel
= ¥306 + ¥2
= ¥308

Therefore, Mohammed has to pay ¥308.",308.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Mohammed needs to buy a week's worth of rice, which is 7 days.

So, the total amount of rice he needs is 7 * 3 = 21 kgs.

The normal brand of rice costs ¥15 per kg, but he has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more.
To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate 20% of ¥15.
20% of ¥15 is 0.20 * ¥15 = ¥3.
So, the more expensive brand costs ¥15 + ¥3 = ¥18 per kg.

However, the store has a 40% discount on rice, which applies only up to 10 kgs.
Mohammed needs 21 kgs of rice, so he will get a discount on the first 10 kgs.
The cost of the first 10 kgs with the discount is ¥18 * 0.60 (since 40% off is the same as paying 60% of the price) = ¥10.80 per kg.
So, the total cost of the first 10 kgs is ¥10.80 * 10 = ¥108.

The remaining 11 kgs (21 - 10 = 11) will be sold at the regular price of ¥18 per kg.
So, the total cost of the remaining 11 kgs is ¥18 * 11 = ¥198.

The total cost of the rice is ¥108 + ¥198 = ¥306.

However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of signatures Jasmine and Mia have collected so far.**

Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures. Let's add them up:

36 (Jasmine) + 31 (Mia) = 67 signatures

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of signatures they need to collect to reach their goal.**

Their goal is to collect 145 signatures between them. Since they already have 67 signatures, they need to collect:

145 (goal) - 67 (current total) = 78 signatures

**Step 3: Calculate the number of signatures Jasmine will collect during the remaining 2 weeks.**

Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 signatures per week, but we don't know her original weekly collection rate. However, we can calculate her total collection over 6 weeks:

36 signatures / 6 weeks = 6 signatures per week (her original rate)

Since her rate is reduced by 5 signatures per week, her new rate is:

6 signatures/week - 5 signatures/week = 1 signature/week

Over 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect:

1 signature/week × 2 weeks = 2 signatures

**Step 4: Calculate the number of signatures Mia needs to collect to reach their goal.**

Since they need to collect 78 signatures in total, and Jasmine will collect 2 signatures, Mia needs to collect:

78 signatures - 2 signatures (Jasmine's contribution) = 76 signatures

Over 2 weeks, Mia needs to collect:

76 signatures ÷ 2 weeks = 38 signatures per week

So, Mia needs to collect 38 signatures per week to help them reach their goal of 145 signatures.",145.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Jasmine has 36 signatures and Mia has 31 signatures, so together they have 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

They want to reach a total of 145 signatures by the end of the break, which is 2 weeks away.

To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal: 145 - 67 = 78.

Since Jasmine can only collect signatures on weekends, her weekly collection is reduced by 5. Let's assume her original weekly collection was x. Then, her new weekly collection is x - 5.

Since there are 2 weeks left, Jasmine will collect a total of 2(x - 5) signatures.

Mia's weekly collection is unknown, let's call it y. Since there are 2 weeks left, Mia will collect a total of 2y signatures.

The total number of signatures they will collect in the next 2 weeks is the sum of Jasmine's and Mia's collections: 2(x - 5) + 2y.

We know that the total number of signatures they need to collect is 78. So, we can set up the equation: 2(x - 5) + 2y = 78.

However, we don't know the value of x, which is Jasmine's original weekly collection. But we can use the information that Jasmine has 36 signatures in 6 weeks, so her average weekly collection is 36 / 6 = 6.

Since Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5, her new weekly collection is 6 - 5 = 1.

Now we can substitute this value into the equation: 2(1) + 2y = 78.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 2 + 2y = 78.

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: 2y = 76.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get: y = 38.

So, Mia needs to collect 38 signatures per week to make sure they reach their goal.

\[Example Input\]
Question: Ryan and Taylor are friends who love collecting stamps. During the summer, the friends spend every Saturday collecting stamps. After 8 weeks, Ryan and Taylor compare their stamp albums, counting up the number of stamps each friend has collected. Ryan has 50 stamps in his album, and Taylor has 43. The friends have 3 more weeks of summer, and they decide they want to reach 192 stamps between them by the end of the summer. However, during the remaining weeks, Ryan is only able to collect stamps every other Saturday, reducing his weekly collection by 6 per week, while Taylor decides to increase his weekly collection. How many stamps will Taylor need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

 Wrong answer: Ryan's new collection rate is 50 / 8 - 6 = 3, so Ryan will collect 3 \* 3 = 9 stamps. Taylor will collect 192 - 9 - 43 = 140 stamps. Taylor collected his original 43 stamps in 8 weeks, so 140 needs to be collected in 3 weeks. The original rate is 43 / 8, 140 stamps / 3 = 46.67 stamps per week, which reduces the answer by 1 and the answer is 45.67. A change from a place-unit value will change the next least unit. We still round down so the answer is 45. (1 or less unit of value)

\[Example Output\]

**Explanation**:
I miscalculated Ryan's new collection rate per week, and then Taylor's new rate. I did not take into consideration that Ryan's stamps will also increase Taylor's new total and rate which also affect Taylor's rate.

**Error Keywords**:

*   Miscalculating the new collection rates per week
*   Not taking into account that the new collection rate totals will also increase the stamps collected and the total rate as well.

**Instructions**:

1.  Determine the total signatures Taylor and Ryan will need to collect after 8 weeks. In this case, 192 - (50 + 43) = 99 stamps to reach their goal.
2.  Calculate how many stamps Ryan will collect during the last 3 weeks. Since Ryan will only be able to collect stamps every other week, Ryan will collect during 1.5 weeks * (50-6) = 1.5 \* 44 = 66 stamps A better calculation, is 50 / 8 \* 3. Ryan can still collect 3 Saturdays stamps in 3 weeks because Ryan's rate does not change per week. So the correct amount will be (50 - 6) \* (3 / 2) = 66 stamps. \*Urban\*
3.  Calculate 50 / 8 \* 3 = 18.75 
4.  Calculate how many stamps Taylor will collect, that is 192 - 43 - 18.75 = 130.25
5.  Finally, the number of stamps Taylor will need to collect per week is 130.25 / 3 stamps.

**Advice**:

*   Ensure to identify all factors that might implement the collection rate in the question.
*   Verify to recalculate the collection rate if any of the individuals' rates have changed.

Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer. You will then use this information to help you answer similar questions in the future.

First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.

Second, list the keywords that describe the type of errors from most general to most specific.

Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.

Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.

Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.

Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.

Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total miles Tom and Alex need to run per week to reach their goal. Since Tom reduces his weekly running distance by 2 miles, he will run 13 miles per week. Let's assume Alex runs x miles per week. The total miles they need to run per week is 240 miles / 8 weeks = 30 miles per week. Since Tom runs 13 miles per week, Alex needs to run 30 - 13 = 17 miles per week to ensure they meet their goal.

Instructions:

* Calculate the total miles needed to be run per week to reach the goal.
* Account for any changes in the running distance of one or both individuals.
* Set up an equation to represent the situation and solve for the unknown variable.
* Check the units of the answer to ensure it makes sense in the context of the problem.

Advice:

* Read the problem carefully and identify the key elements, such as the total miles needed, the number of weeks, and any changes in the running distance.

I answered the question incorrectly because I failed to account for Jasmine's reduced signature collection and didn't accurately calculate the remaining signatures needed to reach the goal. I also didn't consider the correct ratio of signatures collected by Jasmine and Mia.

**Error Keywords**

* Incorrect calculation of remaining signatures
* Failure to account for changes in signature collection
* Insufficient use of ratios and rates
* Incorrect assumption of Mia's increased collection rate

**Step-by-Step Solution**

1. Calculate the total signatures collected by Jasmine and Mia in 6 weeks:
Jasmine: 36 signatures
Mia: 31 signatures
Total: 36 + 31 = 67 signatures
2. Calculate the remaining signatures needed to reach the goal:
Goal: 145 signatures
Remaining signatures: 145 - 67 = 78 signatures
3. Calculate the number of weeks remaining:
2 weeks
4. Calculate the total signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks:
Original weekly collection: unknown
Reduced weekly collection: unknown - 5 signatures/week (since she only collects on weekends)
Let's assume Jasmine's original weekly collection is x signatures/week.
Then, her reduced weekly collection is x - 5 signatures/week.
Total signatures collected by Jasmine in 2 weeks: 2(x - 5)
5. Set up an equation to represent the situation:
Total signatures collected by Jasmine and Mia in 2 weeks = Remaining signatures
2(x - 5) + 2y = 78 (where y is Mia's new weekly collection rate)
6. Since we don't know Jasmine's original weekly collection rate, we can use the information from the first 6 weeks to find it:
Jasmine's total signatures in 6 weeks: 36
Jasmine's weekly collection rate: 36 / 6 = 6 signatures/week
Now we know x = 6.
7. Substitute x into the equation:
2(6 - 5) + 2y = 78
2(1) + 2y = 78
2 + 2y = 78
2y = 76
y = 38
However, this is not the correct answer. We need to re-evaluate the problem.
8. Let's re-examine the equation:
2(x - 5) + 2y = 78
Substitute x = 6:
2(6 - 5) + 2y = 78
2(1) + 2y = 78
2 + 2y = 78
2y = 76
y = 38
Wait, we did the same calculation again! Let's think about it differently.
9. Calculate the total signatures Mia needs to collect in the remaining 2 weeks:
Remaining signatures: 78
Jasmine's reduced collection in 2 weeks: 2(6 - 5) = 2
Mia's total signatures in 2 weeks: 78 - 2 = 76
Mia's weekly collection rate: 76 / 2 = 38
However, this is still not correct. We need to think about it differently.
10. Let's analyze the situation again:
Jasmine collects 6 signatures/week for 6 weeks, so her total is 36.
Mia collects an unknown number of signatures/week for 6 weeks, so her total is 31.

You are an expert in solving multi-step word problems involving ratios and rates.

You have incorrectly answered the following question.

Question: Tom and Alex are two friends who are training for a marathon. Tom runs 15 miles per week, and Alex runs 12 miles per week. If they want to reach a combined total of 240 miles in 8 weeks, and Tom reduces his weekly running distance by 2 miles due to an injury, how many miles will Alex need to run per week to ensure they meet their goal?

Wrong answer: Alex needs to run 20 miles per week. (Mistake: incorrect calculation of the remaining miles needed and failure to account for Tom's reduced running distance)

Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer. You will then use this information to help you answer similar questions in the future.

First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.

Second, list the keywords that describe the type of errors from most general to most specific.

Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.

Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.

Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.

Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.

Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total miles Tom and Alex need to run per week to reach their goal. Since Tom reduces his weekly running distance by 2 miles, he will run 13 miles per week. Let's assume Alex runs x miles per week. The total miles they need to run per week is 240 miles / 8 weeks = 30 miles per week. Since Tom runs 13 miles per week, Alex needs to run 30 - 13 = 17 miles per week to ensure they meet their goal.

Instructions:

* Calculate the total miles needed to be run per week to reach the goal.
* Account for any changes in the running distance of one or both individuals.
* Set up an equation to represent the situation and solve for the unknown variable.
* Check the units of the answer to ensure it makes sense in the context of the problem.

Advice:

* Read the problem carefully and identify the key elements, such as the total miles needed, the number of weeks, and any changes in the running distance.
* Use ratios and rates to set up an equation that represents the situation.
* Check your units and ensure that your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps to avoid errors.

Error Keywords:

* Incorrect calculation of remaining miles
* Failure to account for changes in running distance
* Insufficient use of ratios and rates

For guidance, consider the following example problem and reflection:

Example Question:
Tom and Alex are planning a road trip from New York to Los Angeles. They want to make sure they have enough snacks for the trip. If Tom can pack 15 bags of chips per hour, and Alex can pack 20 bags of chips per hour, how many hours will it take them to pack 480 bags of chips if they work together?

Wrong Answer:
Tom and Alex can pack 35 bags of chips per hour together. To pack 480 bags, they will need 480 / 35 = 13.71 hours. Since they can't work a fraction of an hour, they will need 14 hours to pack the chips.

Correct Answer:
Let's analyze the problem step by step. Tom can pack 15 bags of chips per hour, and Alex can pack 20 bags of chips per hour. Together, they can pack 15 + 20 = 35 bags of chips per hour. To pack 480 bags, they will need 480 / 35 = 13.71 hours. However, since they can't work a fraction of an hour, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, they will need 14 hours to pack the chips.

Now, apply this reflection process to the original question:

Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","**Explanation of the mistake**

I answered the question incorrectly because I didn't accurately calculate Jasmine's reduced collection rate and I didn't account for the correct number of weeks Mia has to reach the goal. I also didn't properly use the information about Jasmine's and Mia's original collection rates.

**Error keywords**

* Misinterpretation of given information
* Incorrect calculation
* Failure to account for changes in collection rates
* Lack of proper use of given information

**Correct solution step-by-step**

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of signatures collected by Jasmine and Mia in the first 6 weeks**

Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures. The total number of signatures collected is 36 + 31 = 67.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of signatures Jasmine and Mia need to collect in the remaining 2 weeks**

The sisters want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. They already have 67 signatures, so they need to collect 145 - 67 = 78 signatures in the remaining 2 weeks.

**Step 3: Calculate Jasmine's reduced collection rate**

Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week. Since Jasmine had 36 signatures in 6 weeks, her original collection rate is 36 / 6 = 6 signatures per week. Her reduced collection rate is 6 - 5 = 1 signature per week.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks**

Jasmine will collect 1 signature per week for 2 weeks, so the total number of signatures Jasmine will collect is 1 * 2 = 2 signatures.

**Step 5: Calculate the number of signatures Mia needs to collect in the remaining 2 weeks**

Since they need to collect 78 signatures in the remaining 2 weeks and Jasmine will collect 2 signatures, Mia needs to collect 78 - 2 = 76 signatures.

**Step 6: Calculate the number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week**

Mia needs to collect 76 signatures in 2 weeks, so the number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week is 76 / 2 = 38. However, since Mia is trying to INCREASE her signature rate in order to make up for Jasmine's reduced rate, the rate of 38 will still be 20 plus some NEW rate increase. Since Jasmine's collection rate went down by 4 (her daily rate decrease reduced her constant weekly rate of 6 by 5, leading to a 4 increase for Mia for her to be able to mantain and possibly change her constant rate), the same increase must occur for Mia's rate for her to collect enough, since their rate increases might not be coequal considering this is the only possible scenario if we analyze carefully (4 or unknown units have to be distributed amongst the m hours of the whole time Mia's collecting). Hence to correctly solve this Mia must collect more than 20.

**Explanation of the mistake**
I misinterpreted the problem and made incorrect calculations. I also didn't properly utilize the given information.

**Keywords for error**

* Misinterpretation of problem
* Incorrect calculations
* Failure to utilize given information

**Correct solution step-by-step**

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of signatures Jasmine and Mia need to collect**

Jasmine and Mia need to collect a total of 145 signatures. They already have 67 signatures, so they need to collect 145 - 67 = 78 signatures.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks**

Jasmine can collect 6 signatures per week, but her collection rate is reduced by 5 signatures per week. So, her new collection rate is 6 - 5 = 1 signature per week. In 2 weeks, she will collect 1 * 2 = 2 signatures.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of signatures Mia needs to collect in the remaining 2 weeks**

Since Jasmine will collect 2 signatures, Mia needs to collect 78 - 2 = 76 signatures in the remaining 2 weeks.

**Step 4: Calculate the number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week**

Mia needs to collect 76 signatures in 2 weeks, so the number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week is 76 / 2 = 38.

**Step 5: Calculate Mia's new collection rate**

Since Mia's original collection rate is not given, we can't calculate her new collection rate. However, we know that she needs to collect 38 signatures per week to reach the goal.

So, Mia needs to collect more than her original rate (not 20), the rate of 38 will suffice this said discussion weighing Perf marrow accurately port Date about quest herein Be continue repeatedly!).

 

**Instructions for correct solution**

Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.

For guidance, consider the following example problem and reflection:

Example Question:
Tom and Alex are planning a road trip from New York to Los Angeles. They want to make sure they have enough snacks for the trip. If Tom can pack 15 bags of chips per hour, and Alex can pack 20 bags of chips per hour, how many hours will it take them to pack 480 bags of chips if they work together?

Wrong Answer:
Tom and Alex can pack 35 bags of chips per hour together. To pack 480 bags, they will need 480 / 35 = 13.71 hours. Since they can't work a fraction of an hour, they will need 14 hours to pack the chips.

Correct Answer:
Let's analyze the problem step by step. Tom can pack 15 bags of chips per hour, and Alex can pack 20 bags of chips per hour. Together, they can pack 15 + 20 = 35 bags of chips per hour. To pack 480 bags, they will need 480 / 35 = 13.71 hours. However, since they can't work a fraction of an hour, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, they will need 14 hours to pack the chips.

Now, apply this reflection process to the original question:

Question: Jasmine and Mia are sisters from Nairobi who love collecting signatures from authors. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Jasmine and Mia compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Jasmine has 36 signatures in her book, and Mia has 31. The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Please provide your reflection, including the explanation of your mistake, error keywords, instructions, advice, and the correct solution.

It takes them 16 minutes to get to the corner where the cinema is. It takes them another 52 minutes to get to the gym. When they reach the gym, they remember they forgot their wallets at home, so they have to return to pick up their wallets and then walk all the way back to the gym again. Once they reach the gym for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the mall without being late?",42.0,"To determine how much longer Sofia and Benjamin have to get to the mall without being late, let's break down the time they've spent so far and the time they have left.

1. Initially, they have 246 minutes to walk to the mall.

2. It takes 16 minutes to get to the corner where the cinema is, so they have 246 - 16 = 230 minutes left.

3. It takes 52 minutes to get to the gym, so they now have 230 - 52 = 178 minutes left.

4. Since they forgot their wallets, they need to return home and then come back to the gym. It takes 52 minutes to get to the gym and 16 minutes to get to the cinema, so the total time to get home is 52 + 16 = 68 minutes. 

5. Since they have to go back to the gym, they'll spend another 52 minutes getting back to the gym (the time spent getting to the corner is included). The total time spent going back home and then back to the gym is 68 + 52 = 120 minutes.

6. They have spent a total of 16 + 52 + 52 + 68 = 188 minutes so far (16 to the cinema and 52 to the gym the first time, then 52 to home and 68 back to the gym the second time).

7. Now, let's calculate the remaining time: they had 246 minutes initially and have spent a total of 188 minutes, so they have 246 - 188 = 58 minutes left.

However we are told initially it takes 52 minutes to get to the gym from the home and a further 16 minutes to the cinema which adds further 68 minutes. Subtracting this from the total available minutes to walk leaves 246 - (52 + 16 + 68) = 246 - 136 = 110 minutes. But they have already spent 52 minutes getting to the gym from the cinema initially and 52 minutes going home and then 52 minutes coming back and a further 16 minutes added when going home gives 110 - 172 = -62. So they used more time getting to the gym. Let's look at this from a different angle.

Initially it takes 246 minutes to get to the mall. It takes them 16 + 52 = 68 minutes to reach the gym, and leaving Sofia and Benjamin 246 - 68 = 178 minutes to get from the gym to the mall initially. But they then forgot their wallets and used another 16 + 52 = 68 minutes walking back home and another 52 minutes to get back to the gym (that we have been told already), so that's a total of 68 + 52 = 120 minutes spent going back home and back to gym. So they now have 178 - 120 = 58 minutes left.",58.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
Sofia and Benjamin start with 246 minutes to walk to the mall.
It takes them 16 minutes to get to the corner where the cinema is.
So, the time left is 246 - 16 = 230 minutes.
Then, it takes them another 52 minutes to get to the gym.
So, the time left is 230 - 52 = 178 minutes.
When they reach the gym, they remember they forgot their wallets at home, so they have to return to pick up their wallets.
The time it takes to return home is the same as the time it took to get to the gym, which is 16 + 52 = 68 minutes.
So, the time left is 178 - 68 = 110 minutes.
Then, they have to walk all the way back to the gym again.
The time it takes to walk back to the gym is the same as the time it took to get to the gym, which is 68 minutes.
So, the time left is 110 - 68 = 42 minutes.

p2,gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"Leon wants to make different sized ice cubes with 312 ounces of water. He can make giant cubes that use 12 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 5 ounces, small cubes that use 1/2 of a ounce, and tiny cubes that are half the size of small cubes. He makes 48 total ice cubes, including 10 giant cubes, 14 small cubes, 12 medium cubes, and some tiny cubes. How many ounces of water does Leon have left?",122.0,"To find the number of ounces of water Leon has left, we need to calculate the total number of ounces used to make the ice cubes.

Giant cubes: 10 cubes x 12 ounces/cube = 120 ounces
Medium cubes: 12 cubes x 5 ounces/cube = 60 ounces
Small cubes: 14 cubes x 0.5 ounces/cube = 7 ounces

We know that Leon made a total of 48 ice cubes. So far, he has made 10 + 14 + 12 = 36 cubes. Therefore, he made 48 - 36 = 12 tiny cubes. 

Tiny cubes use half the water of small cubes, which use 0.5 ounces. Therefore, tiny cubes use 0.5/2 = 0.25 ounces. 
12 tiny cubes x 0.25 ounces/cube = 3 ounces

The total number of ounces used is 120 + 60 + 7 + 3 = 190 ounces. Since Leon started with 312 ounces, the number of ounces he has left is 312 - 190 = 122 ounces.

Leon has 122 ounces of water left.",122.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Leon starts with 312 ounces of water.

He makes 10 giant cubes, each using 12 ounces of water.
So, the total water used for giant cubes is 10 * 12 = 120 ounces.

He makes 12 medium cubes, each using 5 ounces of water.
So, the total water used for medium cubes is 12 * 5 = 60 ounces.

He makes 14 small cubes, each using 1/2 ounce of water.
So, the total water used for small cubes is 14 * 0.5 = 7 ounces.

He also makes some tiny cubes, which are half the size of small cubes, so each tiny cube uses 1/4 ounce of water.
Since he makes a total of 48 ice cubes, and we already know he made 10 giant, 12 medium, and 14 small cubes, the number of tiny cubes is 48 - 10 - 12 - 14 = 12 tiny cubes.
So, the total water used for tiny cubes is 12 * 0.25 = 3 ounces.

Now, let's add up the total water used for all the ice cubes:
120 + 60 + 7 + 3 = 190 ounces.

So, the amount of water left is 312 - 190 = 122 ounces.

The answer is 122.",122.0,1,0,1,122.0,,,
p2,gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"A class of 160 students has various hobbies. 69 like to hike, 8 like to play chess, 13 like to swim, 13 like to play football, and the rest like to either play video games or bake. What percentage of the students like to play video games if the number of the students that like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football?",5.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Find the total number of students who like to hike, play chess, swim, and play football.**

69 (hike) + 8 (chess) + 13 (swim) + 13 (football) = 103

**Step 2: Find the number of students who like to play video games or bake.**

Total students = 160
Students who like other hobbies = 103
Students who like video games or bake = 160 - 103 = 57

**Step 3: Find the number of students who like to bake.**

Let's say the number of students who like to play football is x. Then, the number of students who like to bake is 4x - 3 (since it's 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football).

We know that x = 13 (from the problem statement).

So, the number of students who like to bake = 4(13) - 3 = 52 - 3 = 49

**Step 4: Find the number of students who like to play video games.**

Students who like video games or bake = 57
Students who like to bake = 49
Students who like to play video games = 57 - 49 = 8

**Step 5: Find the percentage of students who like to play video games.**

Number of students who like to play video games = 8
Total students = 160

Percentage = (8 / 160) × 100% ≈ 5%

Therefore, approximately 5% of the students like to play video games.",5.0,1,"Q: A class of 160 students has various hobbies. 69 like to hike, 8 like to play chess, 13 like to swim, 13 like to play football, and the rest like to either play video games or bake. What percentage of the students like to play video games if the number of the students that like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football?

A: Let's think step by step.
The total number of students is 160.
Given the number of students for each hobby: 
- 69 hike
- 8 play chess
- 13 swim
- 13 play football

So, the total number of students with the above hobbies is 69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103.
The number of students left that either play video games or bake is 160 - 103 = 57.

Now, we need to find out how many students bake and how many students play video games.
We are told that the number of students that like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football.
Since the number of students that prefer playing football is 13, four times that would be 13 * 4 = 52.
And three less than 52 is 52 - 3 = 49.

However, this means that the students who like to bake plus the students who like to play video games equals 57, but we know that 49 students bake so, that means 57 - 49 = 8 students like to play video games.

Now to find the percentage of students who like to play video games.
Since there are 160 students in total and 8 of them play video games,

Oliver has also applied for help from the local charity, which has decided to cover 1/10 of the remaining cost of the workshop. How much money is Oliver still missing?",113.0,"To find out how much money Oliver is still missing, we need to calculate the total cost of the workshop and subtract the amount covered by his friends and the charity, as well as the amount Oliver already has.

Total cost of the workshop for 2 days:
 Hotel: 2 x ₣100 = ₣200
 Food: 2 x ₣20 = ₣40 (covered by friends)
 Transportation: 2 x ₣10 = ₣20
Total cost = ₣200 + ₣40 + ₣20 = ₣260

Friends cover the food cost, so we subtract that from the total:
₣260 - ₣40 = ₣220

Oliver already has ₣85, so we subtract that from the remaining cost:
₣220 - ₣85 = ₣135

The charity covers 1/10 of the remaining cost:
1/10 of ₣135 = ₣13.50
So the charity covers ₣13.50.

Now, we subtract the amount covered by the charity from the remaining cost:
₣135 - ₣13.50 = ₣121.50

Oliver is still missing ₣121.50.",121.5,0,"A: Let's think step by step.
The workshop is for 2 days.
Each day costs ₣100 for hotel, ₣20 for food, and ₣10 for transportation.
So, the cost of the workshop for each day is ₣100 + ₣20 + ₣10 = ₣130.
Since the workshop is for 2 days, the total cost of the workshop is 2 * ₣130 = ₣260.

Oliver's friends will cover the cost of the food, which is ₣20 for each day, for a total of 2 * ₣20 = ₣40.
The total cost for Oliver becomes ₣260 - ₣40 = ₣220.

The local charity has decided to cover 1/10 of the remaining cost, which is 1/10 * ₣220 = ₣22.
The total cost for Oliver becomes ₣220 - ₣22 = ₣198.

The bakery has a promotion that if one buys 7 bagels or more, they get a 20% discount on bagels. How much more do 4 loaves of bread cost than 8 bagels?",12.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Find the cost of a bagel**

The cost of a bagel is one-fourth of a loaf of bread, which costs €5. So, the cost of a bagel is:

€5 ÷ 4 = €1.25

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of 8 bagels with a 20% discount**

Since the bakery has a promotion that offers a 20% discount on 7 or more bagels, we'll apply the discount to the cost of 8 bagels.

First, calculate the total cost of 8 bagels without the discount:

8 bagels × €1.25 = €10

Then, apply the 20% discount:

€10 × 0.20 = €2 (discount amount)
€10 - €2 = €8 (cost of 8 bagels with discount)

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of 4 loaves of bread**

The cost of 4 loaves of bread is:

4 loaves × €5 = €20

**Step 4: Find the difference in cost between 4 loaves of bread and 8 bagels**

Now, subtract the cost of 8 bagels from the cost of 4 loaves of bread:

€20 - €8 = €12

Therefore, 4 loaves of bread cost €12 more than 8 bagels.",8.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of a bagel. Since the cost of a bagel is one-fourth of a loaf of bread, and a loaf of bread costs €5, the cost of a bagel is:
€5 / 4 = €1.25

Next, we need to find the cost of 8 bagels. Since the bakery has a promotion that gives a 20% discount on 7 or more bagels, we need to calculate the discount first. The total cost of 8 bagels without discount is:
8 * €1.25 = €10

The discount is 20% of €10, which is:
€10 * 0.20 = €2

So, the cost of 8 bagels with the discount is:
€10 - €2 = €8

Now, we need to find the cost of 4 loaves of bread. Since each loaf costs €5, the total cost is:
4 * €5 = €20

Jamal starts with $80 and wants 10 gallons of paint, each priced at $7.0, and 3 carpenter pencils, each costing $2. The store offers a 10% discount on paint for members. How much more money does Elena have left than Jamal after they leave the store?",8.0,"To find out how much money Elena and Jamal have left, we need to calculate the total cost of their purchases and subtract that from the amount of money they started with.

**Elena's purchases:**

* 15 anchors at $0.26 each = 15 x $0.26 = $3.90
* 9 nails at $0.61 each = 9 x $0.61 = $5.49
* 10 gallons of paint at $7.00 each = 10 x $7.00 = $70.00

Total cost for Elena = $3.90 + $5.49 + $70.00 = $79.39

Elena started with $98.39, so she has:
$98.39 - $79.39 = $19.00 left

**Jamal's purchases:**

* 3 carpenter pencils at $2.00 each = 3 x $2.00 = $6.00

Total cost for Jamal = $63.00 + $6.00 = $69.00

Jamal started with $80, so he has:

Now, let's find out how much more money Elena has left than Jamal:
$19.00 (Elena's remaining money) - $11.00 (Jamal's remaining money) = $8.00

Elena has $8.00 more than Jamal after they leave the store.",8.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total cost of Elena's items:
Elena buys 15 anchors at $0.26 each, so the total cost of anchors is 15 * $0.26 = $3.90.
She also buys 9 nails at $0.61 each, so the total cost of nails is 9 * $0.61 = $5.49.
Additionally, she buys 10 gallons of paint, but we don't know the price of paint yet. We'll come back to this later.
The total cost of Elena's items so far is $3.90 + $5.49 = $9.39.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of Jamal's items:
Jamal buys 10 gallons of paint at $7.00 each, but he gets a 10% discount as a member. So, the price of paint for Jamal is $7.00 - (10% of $7.00) = $7.00 - $0.70 = $6.30 per gallon.
The total cost of paint for Jamal is 10 * $6.30 = $63.00.
He also buys 3 carpenter pencils at $2 each, so the total cost of pencils is 3 * $2 = $6.
The total cost of Jamal's items is $63.00 + $6 = $69.

Now, let's go back to Elena's paint. Since she's not a member, she pays the full price of $7.00 per gallon. The total cost of paint for Elena is 10 * $7.00 = $70.

The total cost of Elena's items is $9.39 + $70 = $79.39.
Elena started with $98.39, so she has $98.39 - $79.39 = $19 left.

Jamal started with $80, so he has $80 - $69 = $11 left.

The difference between the amount of money Elena has left and the amount of money Jamal has left is $19 - $11 = $8.

1. Arash eats 5 pieces per day.
2. Ava eats twice as much as Arash, so she eats 5 x 2 = 10 pieces per day.
3. DeShawn eats twice as much as Ava, so he eats 10 x 2 = 20 pieces per day.

Until DeShawn goes on a diet, the total consumption per day is:
5 (Arash) + 10 (Ava) + 20 (DeShawn) = 35 pieces per day.

After 2 days, the total consumption is:
35 pieces per day x 2 days = 70 pieces.

The number of pieces left is:

The new total consumption per day is:
5 (Arash) + 10 (Ava) + 10 (DeShawn) = 25 pieces per day.

The number of days needed to finish the remaining 50 pieces is:
50 pieces / 25 pieces per day = 2 days.

Ava eats twice as much as Arash, so Ava can eat 2 x 5 = 10 pieces per day.
DeShawn eats twice as much as Ava, so DeShawn can eat 2 x 10 = 20 pieces per day.
Initially, the total number of pieces eaten per day is 5 + 10 + 20 = 35.
For the first 2 days, a total of 35 x 2 = 70 pieces are eaten.
After 2 days, DeShawn cuts the consumption by half, so DeShawn now eats 20 / 2 = 10 pieces per day.

The remaining number of pieces in the cake is 120 - 70 = 50.
To find the number of days needed to eat the remaining pieces, divide the remaining pieces by the new daily consumption: 50 / 25 = 2.

Initially, the care facility has 1900 rooms.

1. One-fourth of the rooms are occupied:
Occupied rooms = (1/4) * 1900 = 475 rooms

2. One-fourth of the rooms are out of service:
Out of service rooms = (1/4) * 1900 = 475 rooms

3. Total rooms that are not available (occupied or out of service):

If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?",796.0,"To find Faisal's average daily earning, we need to calculate his total earnings over the three days and then divide by 3. Let's break it down step by step:

**Wednesday:**

* Muffins: 27 boxes
* Apricot pies: 13 fewer than Thursday, so we'll come back to this later

**Thursday:**

* Muffins: 11 more than Wednesday, so 27 + 11 = 38 boxes
* Apricot pies: 21 boxes

Now we can find the number of apricot pies sold on Wednesday:
Apricot pies on Wednesday = Apricot pies on Thursday - 13

= 8 boxes

**Friday:**

* Muffins: same as the past two days combined, so 27 + 38 = 65 boxes

Now we can calculate the total earnings for each day:

**Wednesday:**
Muffins: 27 boxes × ₺9 = ₺243
Apricot pies: 8 boxes × ₺21 = ₺168
Total earnings on Wednesday = ₺243 + ₺168 = ₺411

Wednesday: 27 boxes of muffins + 8 boxes of apricot pie = 35 boxes
Thursday: 38 boxes of muffins + 21 boxes of apricot pie = 59 boxes

On Friday, Faisal sold as much as he did in the past two days combined, so he sold 35 + 59 = 94 boxes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes of muffins and apricot pies sold over the three days:

Muffins: 27 + 38 + (35 + 59) / 2 = 27 + 38 + 47 = 112 boxes (since the Friday sales are combined, we divide the total by 2 and add it to the Wednesday and Thursday sales)

Out of the remaining class, 45% of the students are choir members or part of dancers. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away tournament. Half of the swimmers are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the tournament?",66.0,"To find out how many students are leaving early, we'll break it down step by step:

1. First, let's calculate how many students are swimmers:
   Total number of students = 120
   50% of the students are swimmers
   So, number of swimmers = 50% of 120 = 0.5 x 120 = 60

2. Next, let's find out how many swimmers are absent due to sickness:
   Half of the swimmers are absent (i.e., 50% of the swimmers are absent)
   So, number of swimmers absent = 50% of 60 = 0.5 x 60 = 30

   Number of swimmers going to the tournament = Total number of swimmers - Absent swimmers
   = 60 - 30 = 30

3. Now, let's calculate how many students are not swimmers (choir or dancers):
   Total number of non-swimmers = Total number of students - Swimmers
   = 120 - 60 = 60
   45% of these non-swimmers are choir or dancers:
   So, number of choir/dancers = 45% of 60 = 0.45 x 60 = 27

4. To find the total number of students going to the tournament, we add the number of swimmers, choir/dancers, and their respective cheerleaders:
   Total cheerleaders = 3 cheerleaders * 3 groups = 3 * 3 = 9
   Total students going to the tournament = Swimmers + Choir/dancers + Total cheerleaders
   = 30 + 27 + 9 = 66

Therefore, 66 students are leaving early for the tournament.",66.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

There are 120 students in Mrs. Garcia's class.
50% of the class are swimmers, which is 0.5 * 120 = 60 swimmers.
So, the remaining class is 120 - 60 = 60 students.
45% of the remaining class are choir members or part of dancers, which is 0.45 * 60 = 27 students in the choir or dancers.
There are 60 swimmers, but half are absent, so the number of swimmers attending is 60 / 2 = 30.
So, there are 30 swimmers, 27 choir or dancers, 3 * 3 = 9 cheerleaders accompanying.
Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 30 + 27 + 9 = 66.

However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",31.0,"To find out how much money Olga will spend, we first need to determine how many flowers she needs to fill her flower bed.

The flower bed is 132 meters long. Each flower and its required spacing takes up 12 + 3 = 15 meters.

We'll divide the length of the flower bed by the length each flower and its spacing takes up to find out how many flowers she needs:
132 meters / 15 meters = 8.8 flowers

So Olga needs 8 flowers (we can't buy a fraction of a flower, and she already has 7, which we will consider when calculating how many to buy). She already has 7 flowers, so she will purchase 8 - 7 = 1 flower.

However, that is incorrect, as she cant fit just 8 flowers on the bed. She'll actually need to fit a full 9 flowers on the bed to maintain a 12 meter gap between the last flower and the edge of the bed (more flower beds would just be out of space).

So Olga needs 9 flowers. She already has 7 flowers, so she will purchase 9 - 7 = 2 flowers.

The cost of the flowers without discount is 2 flowers * ₣9 = ₣18.

Since Olga is buying 2 or more flowers, she doesn't receive a discount. The store's discount is more than 2 plants so in this scenario the discount does nothing.

[Example Input]
Question: Tom has a bookshelf that is 240 cm long. Tom wants to put books on his bookshelf. Each book is 10 cm wide, and Tom wants to leave 5 cm of space between each book. Tom already has 5 books. Each book costs $8 at the store. However, if he buys more than 3 books, he'll receive a $2 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Tom spend at the store to fill up his bookshelf?

Wrong answer: Tom will need 24 books to fill the bookshelf (240 cm / 10 cm per book). Since he already has 5 books, he needs to buy 19 more books. The total cost will be 19 books \* $8 per book = $152.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the total number of books needed, as I didn't account for the space between each book. I also failed to apply the discount correctly.

Error Keywords:
- Incorrect division
- Failure to account for spaces between objects
- Incorrect application of discounts

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total space required for each book, including the space between books.
2. Divide the total length of the bookshelf by the total space required for each book to find the total number of books needed.
3. Subtract the number of books already owned from the total number of books needed to find the number of books to buy.
4. Calculate the total cost of the books to buy, considering any applicable discounts.

Advice:
- Always consider the spaces between objects when calculating the total number of objects needed.
- Double-check calculations for division and multiplication.
- Carefully read the problem to identify any discounts or promotions that may apply.

Solution:
First, calculate the total space required for each book: 10 cm (book width) + 5 cm (space between books) = 15 cm per book.
Next, divide the total length of the bookshelf by the total space required for each book: 240 cm / 15 cm per book = 16 books.
Since Tom already has 5 books, he needs to buy 16 - 5 = 11 books.
The total cost will be 11 books \* $8 per book = $88. Since Tom is buying more than 3 books, he'll receive a $2 discount, making the final cost $88 - $2 = $86.

p2,gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,Olga can peel 6 clams a minute and saute 30 clams in 19 minutes. How many minutes will it take her to peel and saute 150 clams if it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam before peeling it? Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.,163.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to wash the clams**

Olga needs to wash 150 clams, and it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam. To find the total time, we'll multiply the number of clams by the time it takes to wash each clam:

150 clams × 12 seconds/clam = 1800 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we'll convert the time to minutes:

1800 seconds ÷ 60 = 30 minutes

**Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to peel the clams**

Olga can peel 6 clams per minute. To find the time it takes to peel 150 clams, we'll divide the number of clams by the rate at which she peels them:

150 clams ÷ 6 clams/minute = 25 minutes

**Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to sauté the clams**

Olga can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes. To find the time it takes to sauté 150 clams, we'll multiply the time it takes to sauté 30 clams by the number of batches:

150 clams ÷ 30 clams/batch = 5 batches

Since it takes 19 minutes to sauté each batch, we'll multiply the number of batches by the time per batch:

5 batches × 19 minutes/batch = 95 minutes

**Step 4: Add the break time**

Olga needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them. We'll add this break time to the total time:

**Step 5: Calculate the total time**

Now, we'll add up the time it takes to wash the clams, peel the clams, take the break, and sauté the clams:

30 minutes (washing) + 25 minutes (peeling) + 13 minutes (break) + 95 minutes (sautéing) = 163 minutes

Therefore, it will take Olga 163 minutes to peel and sauté 150 clams.",150.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to calculate the time it takes Olga to peel 150 clams. She can peel 6 clams per minute.
So, the time it takes to peel 150 clams is 150 / 6 = 25 minutes.

Before peeling, she needs to wash each clam, which takes 12 seconds per clam. There are 150 clams, so the total washing time is 150 * 12 seconds = 1800 seconds.
We need to convert this to minutes: 1800 seconds / 60 = 30 minutes.

So, the total time spent washing and peeling the clams is 30 minutes (washing) + 25 minutes (peeling) = 55 minutes.

After peeling, Olga takes a 13-minute break.

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes Olga to sauté 150 clams. She can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes.
So, the time it takes to sauté 150 clams is (150 / 30) * 19 minutes = 95 minutes.

Now, we add up the time spent washing, peeling, taking a break, and sautéing: 55 minutes (washing and peeling) + 13 minutes (break) + 95 minutes (sautéing) = 163 minutes.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of pineapples picked on Monday**

Andre picks double the number of pineapples he did on Saturday:

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of pineapples picked in the past 3 days combined**

Saturday: 177 pineapples
Sunday: 183 pineapples
Monday: 354 pineapples
Total: 177 + 183 + 354 = 714 pineapples

Andre picks 177 pineapples on Saturday.
He picks 183 pineapples on Sunday.
So, the total number of pineapples picked on Saturday and Sunday is 177 + 183 = 360.

On Monday, he picks double the number of pineapples he did on Saturday, which is 2 * 177 = 354 pineapples.

On Tuesday, he picks half the amount of what he picked in the past 3 days combined, which is 714 / 2 = 357 pineapples.

The total number of pineapples picked is 714 + 357 = 1071.

On Wednesday, Andre is going to sell pineapples in boxes of 21 pineapples each. To find out how many boxes he can make, we need to divide the total number of pineapples by 21: 1071 / 21 = 51.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Chemistry questions: 40% of 100 questions = 0.4 x 100 = 40 questions
Since Aisha is sure to get 100% of the chemistry questions correctly, she will get 40 questions correct.

2. Geography questions: 20% of 100 questions = 0.2 x 100 = 20 questions
Since Aisha is sure to get 25% of the geography questions correctly, she will get 0.25 x 20 = 5 questions correct.

3. History and algebra questions: The rest of the questions are equally divided between history and algebra. Since 40% + 20% = 60%, the remaining 40% is divided between history and algebra.
40% of 100 questions = 0.4 x 100 = 40 questions
Since history and algebra questions are equally divided, each subject will have 40/2 = 20 questions.

40% of the questions are chemistry, so the number of chemistry questions is 40% of 100 = 0.4 * 100 = 40 questions.
20% of the questions are geography, so the number of geography questions is 20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20 questions.
The rest of the questions are equally divided as history and algebra questions, so the total number of history and algebra questions is 100 - 40 - 20 = 40 questions.
Since they are equally divided, the number of history questions is 40 / 2 = 20 questions, and the number of algebra questions is also 20 questions.

Now, let's find out how many questions Aisha is sure to get correctly.

Aisha is sure to get 100% of the chemistry questions correctly, so she will get 40 questions correct.
She is sure to get 25% of the geography questions correctly, so she will get 25% of 20 = 0.25 * 20 = 5 questions correct.

**First, calculate the pizzas eaten per day by each family member:**

- Uncle: 10 pizzas per day
- Spouse (Aunt): 20 pizzas per day
- Grandchild: 2/4 (which is 1/2) of the combined pizzas eaten by the uncle and aunt
  - Combined pizzas eaten by uncle and aunt: 10 + 20 = 30 pizzas per day
  - Grandchild's pizzas per day: (1/2) * 30 = 15 pizzas per day

**Total pizzas eaten by the family per day in the first month:**

10 (uncle) + 20 (aunt) + 15 (grandchild) = 45 pizzas per day

**Total pizzas eaten by the family in the first month (30 days):**

45 pizzas per day * 30 days = 1350 pizzas

**Now, calculate the pizzas eaten in the second month:**

The family eats 60% less in the first half of the month and then an additional 50% less for the second half, resulting in an overall reduction.

- Pizzas eaten in the first half of the second month: 
  - Reduced by 60%, so it's 40% of the original (100% - 60% = 40%)
  - 40% of 45 pizzas per day: 0.4 * 45 = 18 pizzas per day (for the first half)
  - Pizzas eaten in the first half of the second month (15 days): 18 pizzas per day * 15 days = 270 pizzas

- Pizzas eaten in the second half of the second month: 
  - Reduced by an additional 50%, so it's 50% of the reduced amount from the first half (100% - 50% = 50%)
  - 50% of 18 pizzas per day: 0.5 * 18 = 9 pizzas per day (for the second half)
  - Pizzas eaten in the second half of the second month (15 days): 9 pizzas per day * 15 days = 135 pizzas

**Total pizzas eaten by the family in the second month:**

270 (first half) + 135 (second half) = 405 pizzas

**Total pizzas eaten in two months:**

1350 (first month) + 405 (second month) = 1755 pizzas",1755.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The uncle eats 10 pizzas per day.
The spouse eats 20 pizzas per day.
The combined number of pizzas they eat per day is 10 + 20 = 30 pizzas.
The grandchild eats 2/4 of 30, which is 2/4 * 30 = 15 pizzas.
So, the total number of pizzas they eat per day is 10 + 20 + 15 = 45 pizzas.

In the first month, they eat 45 pizzas per day. Since there are 30 days in a month, the total number of pizzas eaten in the first month is 45 * 30 = 1350 pizzas.

Now, let's consider the second month. They reduce their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month. 
The first half of the month has 15 days. 
The family originally eats 45 pizzas per day, and reducing that by 60% means they now eat 40% of the original amount, which is 0.4 * 45 = 18 pizzas per day.
So for the first 15 days, they eat 18 * 15 = 270 pizzas.

In the second half of the month (also 15 days), their total food consumption is reduced by an additional 50%. This applies to the 40% they already reduced their calories by, meaning they eat 50% of 18, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 pizzas per day.
Therefore, for the last 15 days, they eat 9 * 15 = 135 pizzas.

So, the total number of pizzas they eat in the second month is 270 + 135 = 405 pizzas.

Now, the total number of pizzas the family eats in two months is the sum of the pizzas they ate in the first and second months: 1350 + 405 = 1755 pizzas.
The answer is 1755.",1755.0,1,0,1,1755.0,,,

After accounting for the 700 seats for graduate, 450 seats for the faculty attending, and reserving 50 seats for the event's staff, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?",12.0,"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to first calculate the total number of seats that are already reserved. Let's do that:

Reserved seats for graduates: 700
Reserved seats for faculty: 450
Reserved seats for staff: 50
Total reserved seats: 700 + 450 + 50 = 1200

Now, let's subtract the total reserved seats from the total capacity of the Sports Arena:

Total capacity: 9600
Total reserved seats: 1200
Remaining seats: 9600 - 1200 = 8400

Since the remaining seats will be split equally among the graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:

Remaining seats: 8400
Number of graduates: 700
Tickets per graduate: 8400 ÷ 700 = 12

So, each graduate would receive 12 tickets to give to their friends and family.",12.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
The Sports Arena has space for 9600 people.
There are 700 seats for graduates.
There are 450 seats for the faculty.
There are 50 seats reserved for the event's staff.
So, the total number of seats taken is 700 + 450 + 50 = 1200 seats.
There are 9600 - 1200 = 8400 seats left for friends and family.
Since these seats are split equally among the 700 graduates, we divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates: 8400 / 700 = 12.

From the rest, Mohammed can only respond to 2 less than the 1/2 of them. How many emails does Mohammed respond to in a 6 day work week? Mohammed work overtime on the last day so he can respond to 10% more emails than usual.",61.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of emails that don't require a response**

Mohammed receives 30 emails a day, and 20% of them don't require a response. To calculate 20% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.2:

30 x 0.2 = 6

So, 6 emails don't require a response.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of emails that require a response**

Since 6 emails don't require a response, the number of emails that require a response is:

30 - 6 = 24

**Step 3: Calculate the number of emails Mohammed can respond to**

Mohammed can respond to 2 less than half of the emails that require a response. Half of 24 is:

24 / 2 = 12

And 2 less than 12 is:

12 - 2 = 10

So, Mohammed can respond to 10 emails per day.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of emails Mohammed responds to in a 6-day work week**

Mohammed responds to 10 emails per day, so in a 6-day work week, he responds to:

10 x 6 = 60

**Step 5: Calculate the number of emails Mohammed responds to on the last day (overtime)**

On the last day, Mohammed can respond to 10% more emails than usual. 10% of 10 is:

10 x 0.1 = 1

So, Mohammed can respond to 1 more email on the last day. Therefore, on the last day, he responds to:

10 + 1 = 11

**Step 6: Calculate the total number of emails Mohammed responds to in a 6-day work week (including overtime)**

Mohammed responds to 10 emails per day for 5 days, and 11 emails on the last day. So, the total number of emails he responds to is:

10 x 5 = 50
50 + 11 = 61

Therefore, Mohammed responds to 61 emails in a 6-day work week.",6.0,0,"To solve the problem, let's follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of emails Mohammed receives in a week
Mohammed receives 30 emails per day.
There are 6 days in the work week.
So, the total number of emails per week is 30 * 6 = 180 emails.

Step 2: Calculate the number of emails that don't require a response.
20% of the emails don't require any response.
20% of 180 emails is (20/100) * 180 = 36 emails.
This means the total number of emails that require a response is 180 - 36 = 144 emails.

Step 3: Calculate the number of emails Mohammed responds to on regular days.
Mohammed can respond to 2 less than 1/2 of the remaining emails.
Half of 144 emails is 144 / 2 = 72 emails.
Two less than 72 emails is 72 - 2 = 70 emails.
However, this is for the first five days. He worked overtime on the last day so
on the last day, he does 10% more. So let's first determine the number of
emails that require a response on the last day. On average, this is 24 (144 / 6).
On a normal day, he would do 0.5 * 24 = 12, and then 12 - 2 = 10.
He responds 10% more emails than that on the last day, this is 10 * 1.1 = 11 emails.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of emails Mohammed responds to.
He responds 70 emails over five days and 11 more on the last day.
So, the total number of emails is 70 + 11 = 81 emails, but that is because he responds 10 more emails on the last day than normal but we also need to take into account that 10 email was reduced by 2 normally, but then increased by 10%, but the other days that weren't reduced by 2 originally. Since that would involve math that is extremely complicated as it affects the total in a large way, let's recalculate.
70 emails normal, which are (5 * 0.5 * emails per day - 2).
We'll need to recalculate what emails per day * 5 would be. 70 = (5 * 0.5 - 2 * 5) * emails per day
This leads to: (2.5 * emails per day) = 70 + 70 / 5 = 70 + 10 = 80
emails per day would be then 80 / 2.5 = 32
If the amount per 5 days was 32 and on those 5 days, Mohammed had 70 emails per those five normal days after the 2 less of 0.5
And with the 36 less during those normal six days.
36 in those normal six days do not require emails.
Then you do (180 - 36)/6 days = (144)/6 days = 24 emails per those 6 days
made up of 
U = (half) * Total
T = Total

Of those 6 days. Then solve this system of equations: U = (0.5 * 24) - 2 = 11.
You get 
(T/6) = U were days = 6
(144/6) = 24 of 11 emailed in those 5 days

Solve U to be equations cancelling days by finding
u = 0.5 * T -2, now knowing T (made up as u* days = Total).

**Example Question**
A bakery sells 50 loaves of bread per day. 15% of those loaves are whole wheat. From the rest, they can only sell 10% to a specific customer. How many loaves of bread does the bakery sell to the customer in a 7-day work week? The bakery sells 20% more loaves of whole wheat on the last day of the week.

**Example Wrong Answer**
The bakery sells 50 loaves per day x 7 days = 350 loaves. The customer buys 350 x 0.15 = 52.5 loaves. On the last day, the bakery sells 20% more whole wheat loaves. Therefore, the customer buys 350 x 0.2 = 70 loaves in total.

**Example Correct Answer**
First, calculate the number of loaves of bread that are not whole wheat: 50 x 0.85 = 42.5 loaves per day.
Then, calculate the number of loaves the customer buys per day: 42.5 x 0.1 = 4.25 loaves.
Since the bakery sells 20% more loaves of whole wheat on the last day, the total number of loaves sold remains the same. Therefore, the number of loaves the customer buys on the last day also remains the same.
In a 7-day work week, the bakery sells 4.25 x 7 = 29.75 loaves to the customer.

**Example Explanation**
I made a calculation error by incorrectly applying the percentage increase to the total number of loaves.

Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","**Reflection on the incorrect answer**

I answered the question incorrectly because I made a calculation error and misunderstood the problem. Specifically, I incorrectly calculated the number of emails Mohammed can respond to on a normal day and failed to properly account for the 10% increase in emails he can respond to on the day he works overtime.

**Error Keywords**

- Percentage calculation
- Multi-step calculation
- Misunderstanding of the problem
- Calculation error
- Incorrect application of overtime increase

**Correct Solution**

Step 1: Calculate the number of emails that don't require a response.
20% of 30 emails don't require a response: 30 x 0.2 = 6 emails.

Step 2: Calculate the number of emails Mohammed can respond to on a normal day.
From the rest of the emails (30 - 6 = 24), Mohammed can respond to 2 less than half of them: (24 / 2) - 2 = 10 emails.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of emails Mohammed responds to in a 5-day work week.
10 emails/day x 5 days = 50 emails.

Step 4: Calculate the number of emails Mohammed can respond to on the day he works overtime.
On the last day, Mohammed can respond to 10% more emails than usual: 10 x 1.1 = 11 emails.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of emails Mohammed responds to in a 6-day work week.
50 emails (from the first 5 days) + 11 emails (on the last day) = 61 emails.

On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?",85.0,"To find the amount of time it takes Ananya to complete her 24-mile walk, we first need to find the amount of time she spends walking on the sidewalk. To do this, we can start by using the information about her time spent on the beach.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, let's find Ananya's speed on the beach in miles per hour. We know she walks 10 miles on the beach, and she walks on the beach for 50 minutes. Since we are given a time in minutes, we will use this unit consistently throughout this problem, To convert her walking speed to miles per minute, we can use the formula:

Speed = Distance / Time

The time on the beach is 50 minutes, so the speed is:

10 miles / 50 minutes = 0.2 miles per minute on the beach before the injury

However, due to her recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half on the beach. 

So her new speed is: 
0.2 miles per minute / 2 = 0.1 miles per minute 

2. Since Ananya walks on the sidewalk at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk by multiplying her speed on the beach by 2:

0.1 miles/minute * 2 = 0.2 miles/minute on the sidewalk before the injury

However, her walking speed has also decreased by half on the sidewalk. 

So her new speed is: 
0.2 miles per minute / 2 = 0.1 miles per minute

3. Now, we know the distance Ananya walks on the sidewalk (14 miles) and her speed on the sidewalk (0.1 miles per minute). We can find the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk by using the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 14 miles / 0.1 miles/minute = 140 minutes

4. Since Ananya walks 50 minutes on the beach and 140 minutes on the sidewalk, we can find the total amount of time it takes her to complete the 24-mile walk by adding these two times together:

Total Time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
Total Time = 50 minutes + 140 minutes
Total Time = 190 minutes

So, it takes Ananya 190 minutes to complete the entire 24-mile walk.",24.0,0,"I'm happy to help you with this problem. Here's my step-by-step solution:

A: Let's think step by step.
We know Ananya walks 10 miles on the beach and 14 miles on the sidewalk.
On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach.
Due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk.
We are asked to find the total time it takes for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk in minutes.

First, we need to find the original time Ananya would have taken to walk 10 miles on the beach before the injury. We know she spends 50 minutes walking on the beach after the injury, and her speed has decreased by half, so she would have taken half the time before the injury.
So, the time taken before the injury is 50 / 2 = 25 minutes for 10 miles on the beach.

Since Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk, it would take her half the time to walk the same distance on the sidewalk as it does on the beach.
So, the time taken to walk 1 mile on the beach is 10 minutes (from the 25 minutes calculated above for 10 miles), and it takes 5 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.
However, since Ananya's speed has decreased by half on both the beach and the sidewalk, the actual time taken is 10 minutes for each mile on the beach and 10 minutes for each mile on the sidewalk.

The total time taken on the beach is 50 minutes.
The total time taken on the sidewalk is 14 * (10.minutes for a mile that would take 5 minutes before the injury)  = 140 minutes.

Now, let's add the time spent walking on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time.
So, the total time taken is 50 + 140 = 190 minutes.

The answer is 190.",190.0,0,1,0,225.0,"**Adapted Self-Reflection Prompt for Rate and Time Problems**

Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","**Reflection on Mistake**

I answered the question incorrectly because I miscalculated Ananya's speed on the beach and sidewalk. I forgot to account for the decrease in speed due to her injury and also incorrectly converted the time spent on the beach. I did not properly use the given information about the rates on the sidewalk and beach to find the time spent on each segment.

**Error Keywords:**

- Rate and time problems
- Unit conversion errors
- Calculation errors
- Incomplete analysis of rates

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Let's denote the speed on the beach as x miles per hour. Then, the speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per hour.**

2. **Due to the injury, Ananya's speed decreases by half on both the beach and sidewalk. So, her new speed on the beach is x/2 miles per hour, and on the sidewalk is (2x)/2 = x miles per hour.**

3. **We know that Ananya spends 50 minutes walking on the beach, which is equivalent to 50/60 = 5/6 hours. The distance she covers on the beach can be calculated using the formula: distance = speed × time. Since the distance on the beach is 10 miles, we can set up the equation:**

10 = (x/2) × (5/6)

**Solve for x:**

10 = (5x/12)

x = 24/5 miles per hour

**This means the original speed on the beach is x = 24/5 miles per hour, and the new speed on the beach is x/2 = 12/5 miles per hour. The original speed on the sidewalk is 2x = 48/5 miles per hour, and the new speed on the sidewalk is x = 24/5 miles per hour.**

4. **Now, we can find the time spent walking on the sidewalk. The distance on the sidewalk is 14 miles, and Ananya's speed on the sidewalk is 24/5 miles per hour. Using the formula: time = distance / speed, we get:**

time = 14 / (24/5)

time = 70/24 = 35/12 hours

**Convert this time from hours to minutes:**

time = (35/12) × 60 = 175 minutes

**The total time it takes Ananya to complete the 24-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach (50 minutes) and the time spent on the sidewalk (175 minutes):**

total time = 50 + 175 = 225 minutes

**Instructions for Correctly Solving the Problem:**

- Calculate the rates on each segment of the journey, taking into account any changes in speed.
- Use the rates to determine the time spent on each segment.
- Convert between units of time as necessary.
- Double-check calculations, especially when dealing with rates and unit conversions.
- Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.

**General Advice for Solving Similar Problems:**

- Always read the problem carefully and make sure you understand all given information.

Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","I'll reflect on the original problem and provide the correct solution.

**Reflection on the original problem**

I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the impact of the speed decrease on Rohan's overall time. I correctly calculated Rohan's original speed uphill and downhill, but I failed to account for the decrease in speed due to the snowstorm. I also made a calculation error when determining the time spent downhill.

**Error Keywords**

* Incorrect application of speed changes
* Misunderstanding of proportional relationships
* Calculation errors

**Correct Solution**

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Rohan bikes 6 miles uphill and 12 miles downhill.
2. His original speed uphill is unknown, but we know he takes 30 minutes to bike 6 miles uphill. Let's call his original speed uphill ""x"" miles/minute. Then, his original speed downhill is 3x miles/minute.
3. Due to the snowstorm, his speed decreases by one-third both uphill and downhill. So, his new speed uphill is (2/3)x miles/minute, and his new speed downhill is 2x miles/minute (since 3x - (1/3)(3x) = 2x).
4. We know Rohan takes 30 minutes to bike 6 miles uphill at his new speed. We can set up the equation: 6 miles / (2/3)x miles/minute = 30 minutes. Solving for x, we get x = 1/5 miles/minute (which is the same as before).
5. However, we need to recalculate his new speed downhill, which is 2x = 2(1/5) = 2/5 miles/minute.
6. Now, we can calculate the time spent downhill: 12 miles / (2/5) miles/minute = 30 minutes.
7. Therefore, the total time it takes Rohan to complete the entire 18-mile bike ride is 30 minutes uphill + 30 minutes downhill = 60 minutes.

**Instructions for future problems**

1. Identify the specific rates of speed on different segments of the route.
2. Apply the correct proportions to determine the speed ratio between the segments.
3. Calculate the time spent on each segment using the appropriate rate and distance.
4. Verify that the correct answer involves adding the times spent on each segment and consider potential changes in speed.
5. Double-check calculations and ensure that speed changes are applied correctly.

Now, I'll move on to the new question:

**Question:** Ananya walks 24 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 miles of walking on the beach and 14 miles of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?

**Solution**

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Ananya walks 10 miles on the beach and 14 miles on the sidewalk.
2. Her original speed on the beach is unknown, but we know she takes 50 minutes to walk 10 miles on the beach. Let's call her original speed on the beach ""x"" miles/minute. Then, her original speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles/minute.
3. Due to the injury, her speed decreases by half both on the beach and sidewalk. So, her new speed on the beach is (1/2)x miles/minute, and her new speed on the sidewalk is x miles/minute.
4. We know Ananya takes 50 minutes to walk 10 miles on the beach at her new speed. We can set up the equation: 10 miles / (1/2)x miles/minute = 50 minutes. Solving for x, we get x = 1/5 miles/minute.
5. Now, we can calculate her new speed on the sidewalk, which is x = 1/5 miles/minute.
6. We can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk: 14 miles / (1/5) miles/minute = 70 minutes.
7. Therefore, the total time it takes Ananya to complete the entire 24-mile walk is 50 minutes on the beach + 70 minutes on the sidewalk = 120 minutes.

I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the relationship between Ananya's speed on the beach and sidewalk. I also failed to correctly apply the concept of rate and time to solve the problem. Specifically, I did not accurately calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk.

**Keywords for Error Type (from most general to most specific)**

1. Misunderstanding of rate and time concepts
2. Incorrect application of rate and time formulas
3. Failure to account for speed changes on both beach and sidewalk
4. Miscalculation of time spent walking on the sidewalk

**Step-by-Step Solution with Corrections**

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let Ananya's speed on the beach be x miles per hour. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per hour (since she walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk).
2. Due to the injury, Ananya's speed decreases by half on both the beach and sidewalk. So, her new speed on the beach is x/2 miles per hour, and her new speed on the sidewalk is 2x/2 = x miles per hour.
3. We know that Ananya spends 50 minutes walking on the beach. To find the distance she covers on the beach, we can use the formula: distance = speed × time. Since the speed is x/2 miles per hour, and the time is 50 minutes (or 50/60 = 5/6 hours), the distance covered on the beach is:

distance = (x/2) × (5/6) = 5x/12 miles

Since Ananya walks 10 miles on the beach, we can set up the equation:

5x/12 = 10

Solving for x, we get:

x = 24/5 miles per hour

So, Ananya's original speed on the beach is 24/5 miles per hour, and her original speed on the sidewalk is 2 × (24/5) = 48/5 miles per hour.

4. After the injury, Ananya's speed on the beach is (24/5)/2 = 12/5 miles per hour, and her speed on the sidewalk is (48/5)/2 = 24/5 miles per hour.
5. We know that Ananya walks 14 miles on the sidewalk. To find the time she spends walking on the sidewalk, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. Since the distance is 14 miles, and the speed is 24/5 miles per hour, the time spent walking on the sidewalk is:

time = 14 / (24/5) = 14 × (5/24) = 35/6 hours

Converting this to minutes, we get:

time = (35/6) × 60 = 350/6 = 58.33 minutes

6. Finally, we can find the total time Ananya spends walking by adding the time spent on the beach (50 minutes) and the time spent on the sidewalk (58.33 minutes):

total time = 50 + 58.33 = 108.33 minutes

**Detailed Instructions for Correct Solution**

1. Identify the original speeds on the beach and sidewalk.
2. Calculate the new speeds after the injury.
3. Use the formula distance = speed × time to find the distance covered on the beach.
4. Set up an equation to solve for the original speed on the beach.
5. Calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk using the formula time = distance / speed.
6. Convert the time from hours to minutes.
7. Add the time spent on the beach and sidewalk to find the total time.

**General Advice for Similar Problems**

3. Use formulas and equations to solve the problem step by step.
4. Double-check calculations and units.
5. Consider the effects of changes in speed or rate on the problem.

How many cookies are still hidden in the yard?",64.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amelia initially had 11 dozen cookies. Since a dozen is equal to 12 cookies, Amelia had 11 x 12 = 132 cookies.

2. She ate 5 cookies for breakfast, so she had 132 - 5 = 127 cookies left.

4. Mei finds twice as many as Elena: 2 x 5 = 10 cookies.

5. Xavier finds 2 less than Mei: 10 - 2 = 8 cookies.

6. Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier: 8 / 8 = 1 cookie.

7. Ellie is not mentioned in this question we will continue without referencing this person.
 
8. Umar finds two dozen cookies (2 * 12 = 24) more than Mei and Elena combined. First, find how many cookies Mei and Elena combined found: 10 + 5 = 15 cookies. Umar finds 24 + 15 = 39 cookies.

Now, let's add up the number of cookies found: 5 + 10 + 8 + 1 + 39 = 63 cookies.

There were 127 cookies initially left in the yard after Amelia ate 5. Now, subtracting the number of cookies found: 127 - 63 = 64 cookies.

Amelia initially had 11 dozen cookies. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 cookies, Amelia had 11 * 12 = 132 cookies.

She ate 5 cookies for breakfast, so the number of cookies left is 132 - 5 = 127 cookies.

Elena finds 5 cookies, so the number of cookies left is 127 - 5 = 122 cookies.

Mei finds twice as many as Elena, which is 2 * 5 = 10 cookies. So, the number of cookies left is 122 - 10 = 112 cookies.

Xavier finds 2 less than Mei, which is 10 - 2 = 8 cookies. So, the number of cookies left is 112 - 8 = 104 cookies.

Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier, which is 8 / 8 = 1 cookie. So, the number of cookies left is 104 - 1 = 103 cookies.

Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined. Mei and Elena combined found 10 + 5 = 15 cookies. Two dozen cookies is 2 * 12 = 24 cookies. So, Umar finds 24 + 15 = 39 cookies. However, this is not the number of cookies Umar finds from the yard, but rather the total number of cookies he finds. Since Umar finds 39 cookies in total, and Mei and Elena found 15 cookies, Umar finds 39 - 15 = 24 cookies from the yard. However, this is not correct, as Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined, not from the yard. Umar finds 24 cookies more than Mei and Elena combined, which is 24 cookies. So, the number of cookies left is 103 - 24 = 79 cookies.

Solution:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Tom starts with 15 boxes of crayons.
2. He gives 3 boxes to his sister, leaving him with 15 - 3 = 12 boxes.
3. He finds 2 more boxes in the attic, so now he has 12 + 2 = 14 boxes.
4. Alex finds 4 boxes, and Ben finds 2 fewer boxes than Alex, so Ben finds 4 - 2 = 2 boxes.
5. Tom's mom finds 1/4 as many boxes as Ben, which is 1/4 x 2 = 0.5 boxes (round down to 0 boxes since you can't have a fraction of a box).
6. Tom's dad finds 3 boxes more than Alex and Ben combined, which is 4 + 2 + 3 = 9 boxes.
7. To find the total number of boxes left in the attic, subtract the number of boxes found by each person from the initial number of boxes: 14 - 4 - 2 - 0 - 9 = -1 box (this means Tom's dad found more boxes than were initially in the attic, which is not possible).

Correct answer: There are 0 boxes of crayons left in the attic.

Note: The correct answer is not a straightforward calculation, but rather a realization that the problem's constraints lead to an impossible situation.

Question: Amelia initially had 11 dozen cookies, then ate 5 cookies for breakfast, and then hid the rest in the yard for the Easter egg hunt. Elena finds 5 cookies. Mei finds twice as many as Elena. Xavier finds 2 less than Mei. Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier, and Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined. How many cookies are still hidden in the yard?

**Step-by-step solution**

1. Amelia initially had 11 dozen cookies, which is 11 x 12 = 132 cookies.
2. She ate 5 cookies for breakfast, leaving her with 132 - 5 = 127 cookies.
3. Elena finds 5 cookies, leaving 127 - 5 = 122 cookies.
4. Mei finds twice as many as Elena, which is 2 x 5 = 10 cookies. This leaves 122 - 10 = 112 cookies.
5. Xavier finds 2 less than Mei, which is 10 - 2 = 8 cookies. This leaves 112 - 8 = 104 cookies.
6. Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier, which is 1/8 x 8 = 1 cookie. This leaves 104 - 1 = 103 cookies.
7. Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined, which is 2 x 12 + 5 + 10 = 39 cookies. This leaves 103 - 39 = 64 cookies.

p2,gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"Oscar collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes. The first 2 have 100 apartments each and the last one is 35% bigger than the other 2 combined. However, this week, 9 apartments from each of the first 2 complexes were vacant and did not require collection service. Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each place and he gets paid ₣0.5 per collection for each apartment. He also earns an additional 10% in tips. How much money does he make in a week?",1243.0,"To find the total amount of money Oscar earns, we'll need to calculate the number of collections he makes and multiply that by the amount he earns per collection.

1. First, let's calculate the number of apartments in the last complex:
Let x be the number of apartments in the last complex. 
Since the last complex is 35% bigger than the other 2 complexes combined, we can write:
x = 1.35(100 + 100)
x = 1.35 * 200
x = 270 apartments

2. Next, let's find the number of apartments that Oscar collects garbage from, considering the vacant apartments:
First 2 complexes: Collects garbage from (100 - 9) * 2 = 182 apartments
Last complex: Collects garbage from 270 apartments
Total collections = 182 + 270 = 452 apartments per day

3. Since Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week, the total number of collections in a week is:
5 * 452 = 2260 collections per week

4. Oscar earns ₣0.5 per collection and gets a 10% tip. So, his total earnings per collection would be:
₣0.5 + ₣0.05 (10% of ₣0.5) = ₣0.55 per collection

5. Finally, we can multiply the total number of collections by his earnings per collection to find his total weekly income:
2260 collections * ₣0.55/collection = ₣1243",1243.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of apartments in the last complex. 
The first 2 apartments have 100 apartments each, which means they have a total of 100 + 100 = 200 apartments.
Since the last one is 35% bigger than the other 2 combined, we first calculate 35% of 200 apartments.
35% of 200 is 0.35 * 200 = 70 apartments.
So, the last apartment complex is 200 + 70 = 270 apartments.

However, this week, 9 apartments from each of the first 2 complexes were vacant and did not require collection service.
So, the first 2 complexes have (100 - 9) * 2 = 182 apartments to collect from.

The total number of apartments to collect from is 182 + 270 = 452 apartments.

Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week, so the total collections are 452 * 5 = 2260 collections.
He gets paid ₣0.5 per collection, so the total payment is 2260 * 0.5 = ₣1130.
Additionally, he earns a 10% tip, so the tip amount is 0.1 * 1130 = ₣113.
So, the total amount of money Oscar makes in a week is 1130 + 113 = ₣1243.

**Discount (20% of total bill)**
Discount = 20% of ₺30 = 0.20 × ₺30 = ₺6

**Total cost after discount**
Total cost = ₺30 - ₺6 = ₺24

So, a 60-minute call would cost ₺24.",24.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

For the first 10 minutes, the cost is ₺0.8 per minute.
So, the cost for the first 10 minutes is 10 * ₺0.8 = ₺8.

For the next 30 minutes (from 10 to 40 minutes), the cost is ₺0.7 per minute.
So, the cost for the next 30 minutes is 30 * ₺0.7 = ₺21.

For the remaining 20 minutes (from 40 to 60 minutes), the cost is ₺0.1 per 2 minutes.
Since there are 10 sets of 2 minutes in 20 minutes, the cost for the remaining 20 minutes is 10 * ₺0.1 = ₺1.

The total cost is the sum of the costs for each period: ₺8 + ₺21 + ₺1 = ₺30.

Since the total bill is more than ₺25, a 20% discount is applied.
The discount amount is 20% of ₺30, which is 0.2 * ₺30 = ₺6.

The final cost is the total cost minus the discount: ₺30 - ₺6 = ₺24.

If they work for 8 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?",50.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time needed to clean all rooms**

Original time per room: 6 minutes
New time per room (due to injury): 2 x 6 minutes = 12 minutes
Total number of rooms: 200
Total time needed to clean all rooms: 200 rooms x 12 minutes/room = 2400 minutes

**Step 2: Convert total time to hours**

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
2400 minutes ÷ 60 = 40 hours

Number of days: 10
Hours worked per day: 8
Total time available to clean: 10 days x 8 hours/day = 80 hours

**Step 4: Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning rooms**

Since the janitor has 80 hours to clean, and it will take them 40 hours to clean all rooms, we can calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning as follows:

Percentage of day spent cleaning = (Time spent cleaning / Total time available) x 100
= (40 hours / 80 hours) x 100
= 0.5 x 100

So, on average, the janitor will spend 50% of their day cleaning rooms.",50.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The janitor has to clean 200 rooms.
It takes them 6 minutes per room, but due to the injury, it will take them twice as long, so it will take them 6 * 2 = 12 minutes per room.
The total time it will take to clean all the rooms is 200 * 12 = 2400 minutes.
The janitor has 10 days to get it done, and they work for 8 hours a day. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so they work for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day.
The total time they will spend cleaning rooms is 2400 minutes.
To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning rooms, we need to divide the total time spent cleaning by the total time they work per day, and then multiply by 100.
So, the percentage of their day spent cleaning rooms is (2400 / 4800) * 100 = (2400 / (10 * 480)) * 100 = (2400 / 4800) * 100 = 50%.

1. In the first 10 seconds, 70 kernels pop.

2. In the next 10 seconds, 2 times the amount of kernels pop, which is 2 * 70 = 140 kernels.

3. In the next 10 seconds, 4 times the initial rate of kernels pop, which is 4 * 70 = 280 kernels.

4. In the final 10 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 10 seconds. Since 280 kernels popped in the past 10 seconds, this is half of that: 0.5 * 280 = 140 kernels.

We know that there are 5 white bricks and twice as many orange bricks, which means there are 2 x 5 = 10 orange bricks.

We also know that the total number of bricks in the building is 30.

Let's use a variable to represent the unknown number of green bricks. Let's call it G.

Subtract 15 from both sides:

G = 15

So, there are 15 green bricks.

Now, let's find the percentage of bricks that are green. To do this, we'll divide the number of green bricks by the total number of bricks and multiply by 100:
