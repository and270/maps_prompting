How much was the total cost if she received 25% discount on all purchases?",582.0,"To find the total cost of Beatriz's purchases, we will first calculate the cost of each type of baked good, then sum them up, and finally apply the 25% discount.

1. **Calculate the cost of croissants:**
   - Beatriz bought 6 dozen croissants at $19 per dozen.
   \[
   \text{Cost of croissants} = 6 \text{ dozen} \times 19 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 114 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of macarons:**
   - Beatriz bought 4 dozen macarons at $77 per dozen.
   \[
   \text{Cost of macarons} = 4 \text{ dozen} \times 77 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 308 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of brownies:**
   - Beatriz bought 3 dozen brownies at $118 per dozen.
   \[
   \text{Cost of brownies} = 3 \text{ dozen} \times 118 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 354 \text{ dollars}

But as I pour it, I spill 7 liters of the mango drink. To make up for that, I add 7 liters of water to the mix. What percentage of the final mix is water?",50.0,"To find the percentage of water in the final mix, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the mango drink.**
   - The mango drink is 16 liters and is one-ninth water.
   - Amount of water in the mango drink = \( \frac{1}{9} \times 16 = \frac{16}{9} \) liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the apple drink.**
   - The apple drink is 14 liters and is one-half water.
   - Amount of water in the apple drink = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7 \) liters.

3. **Calculate the total amount of water before the spill.**
   - Total water before the spill = water in mango drink + water in apple drink
   - Total water = \( \frac{16}{9} + 7 \).

   To add these, we convert 7 to a fraction with a denominator of 9:
   \[
   7 = \frac{63}{9}
   \]
   Now, we can add:
   \[
   \text{Total water} = \frac{16}{9} + \frac{63}{9} = \frac{79}{9} \text{ liters}.
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount of mango drink after the spill.**
   - Initially, there are 16 liters of mango drink, but 7 liters are spilled.
   - Remaining mango drink = \( 16 - 7 = 9 \) liters.

5. **Calculate the amount of water in the remaining mango drink.**
   - The remaining mango drink is still one-ninth water.
   - Amount of water in the remaining mango drink = \( \frac{1}{9} \times 9 = 1 \) liter.

6. **Calculate the total amount of water after the spill and adding water.**
   - After the spill, we add 7 liters of water.
   - Total water after the spill = water from remaining mango drink + water from apple drink + added water
   \[
   \text{Total water} = 1 + 7 + 7 = 15 \text{ liters}.
   \]

7. **Calculate the total volume of the final mix.**
   - Total volume = remaining mango drink + apple drink + added water
   \[
   \text{Total volume} = 9 + 14 + 7 = 30 \text{ liters}.
   \]

8. **Calculate the percentage of water in the final mix.**
   - Percentage of water = \( \left( \frac{\text{Total water}}{\text{Total volume}} \right) \times 100 \)
   \[
   \text{Percentage of water} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\%.
   \]

Thus, the percentage of the final mix that is water is \( \boxed{50\%} \).",50.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the mango drink:**
   - The total amount of mango drink is 16 liters.
   - The mango drink is one-ninth water.
   - So, the amount of water in the mango drink is \( \frac{16}{9} \) liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the apple drink:**
   - The total amount of apple drink is 14 liters.
   - The apple drink is one-half water.
   - So, the amount of water in the apple drink is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) liters.

3. **Calculate the total amount of water before the spill:**
   - Total water from mango drink: \( \frac{16}{9} \) liters.
   - Total water from apple drink: 7 liters.
   - Total water before the spill is \( \frac{16}{9} + 7 \).

   To add these, we need a common denominator:
   - Convert 7 liters to ninths: \( 7 = \frac{63}{9} \).
   - So, total water before the spill is \( \frac{16}{9} + \frac{63}{9} = \frac{79}{9} \) liters.

4. **Calculate the amount of mango drink after the spill:**
   - Initially, there were 16 liters of mango drink.
   - After spilling 7 liters, the remaining mango drink is \( 16 - 7 = 9 \) liters.

5. **Calculate the total volume of the final mix:**
   - Remaining mango drink: 9 liters.
   - Apple drink: 14 liters.
   - Water added: 7 liters.
   - Total volume of the final mix is \( 9 + 14 + 7 = 30 \) liters.

6. **Calculate the total amount of water in the final mix:**
   - Total water from the mango drink: \( \frac{16}{9} \) liters.
   - Total water from the apple drink: 7 liters.

   - Total water in the final mix is \( \frac{79}{9} + 7 = \frac{79}{9} + \frac{63}{9} = \frac{142}{9} \) liters.

7. **Calculate the percentage of water in the final mix:**
   - The percentage of water is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of water} = \left( \frac{\text{Total water}}{\text{Total volume}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   - Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of water} = \left( \frac{\frac{142}{9}}{30} \right) \times 100
   \]
   - Simplifying:
   \[
   = \left( \frac{142}{9 \times 30} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{142}{270} \right) \times 100
   \]
   - Calculating \( \frac{142}{270} \approx 0.5259 \).
   - Therefore, \( 0.5259 \times 100 \approx 52.59\% \).

The answer is approximately 52.59%.",52.59,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the mango drink:**

If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 10 hours if she spends 2/5 of the time running, 1/2 of the time skipping, and the remaining of the time walking?",27.0,"To solve the problem, we first need to determine Mei's walking, running, and skipping speeds based on the information provided.

1. **Determine Mei's skipping speed**:
   - We know that Mei can skip at a speed of 2 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Mei's running speed**:
   - It is given that she can skip at a rate that is 1/2 as fast as she can run. Therefore, if her skipping speed is 2 miles per hour, her running speed can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

3. **Determine Mei's walking speed**:
   - It is also given that Mei can run four times faster than she can walk. Therefore, we can find her walking speed:
   \[
   \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

Now we have the following speeds:
- Walking speed: 1 mile per hour
- Running speed: 4 miles per hour
- Skipping speed: 2 miles per hour

4. **Determine the time spent on each activity**:
   - The total time is 10 hours.
   - Time spent running: \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 10 hours
   \[
   \text{Time running} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10 = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]
   - Time spent skipping: \( \frac{1}{2} \) of 10 hours
   \[
   \text{Time skipping} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]
   - Time spent walking: The remaining time is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Time walking} = 10 - \left(4 + 5\right) = 10 - 9 = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

5. **Calculate the distance traveled in each activity**:
   - Distance running:
   \[
   \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 4 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
   \]
   - Distance skipping:
   \[
   \text{Distance skipping} = \text{Skipping speed} \times \text{Time skipping} = 2 \text{ miles per hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ miles}
   \]
   - Distance walking:
   \[
   \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 1 \text{ mile}

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled**:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance skipping} + \text{Distance walking} = 16 + 10 + 1 = 27 \text{ miles}

Thus, the total distance Mei can travel in 10 hours is \(\boxed{27}\) miles.",27.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine Mei's running speed**: 
   - We know that she can skip at 2 miles per hour.
   - Since she skips at a rate that is 1/2 as fast as she can run, we can find her running speed by doubling her skipping speed.
   - Running speed = 2 * 2 miles per hour = 4 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Mei's walking speed**: 
   - Mei can run four times faster than she can walk.
   - Therefore, her walking speed = Running speed / 4 = 4 miles per hour / 4 = 1 mile per hour.

3. **Calculate the total time spent running, skipping, and walking**:
   - The total time is 10 hours.
   - Time spent running = (2/5) of 10 hours = (2/5) * 10 = 4 hours.
   - Time spent skipping = (1/2) of 10 hours = (1/2) * 10 = 5 hours.
   - Time spent walking = Total time - (Time spent running + Time spent skipping) = 10 - (4 + 5) = 10 - 9 = 1 hour.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled in each activity**:
   - Distance running = Running speed * Time spent running = 4 miles per hour * 4 hours = 16 miles.
   - Distance skipping = Skipping speed * Time spent skipping = 2 miles per hour * 5 hours = 10 miles.
   - Distance walking = Walking speed * Time spent walking = 1 mile per hour * 1 hour = 1 mile.

If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?",180.0,"To determine how many ounces of cookies you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume**:
   - Your daily calorie target is 2300 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1200 calories.
   - You have burned 100 calories through exercise.

   The effective calories consumed after exercise is:
   \[
   \text{Effective calories consumed} = 1200 - 100 = 1100 \text{ calories}

2. **Determine the calories per serving of cookies**:
   - Each serving of cookies has 200 calories.

3. **Calculate how many servings you can consume with the remaining calories**:
   \[
   \text{Number of servings} = \frac{\text{Remaining calories}}{\text{Calories per serving}} = \frac{1200}{200} = 6 \text{ servings}

4. **Find out how many ounces of cookies this corresponds to**:
   - The bag contains 5 servings and has a total weight of 150 oz.
   - Therefore, each serving weighs:
   \[
   \text{Weight per serving} = \frac{150 \text{ oz}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 30 \text{ oz per serving}

However, since the bag only contains 150 oz, you cannot eat 180 oz. You can only eat the entire bag of cookies, which is 150 oz.

**Conclusion**: You can eat the entire 150 oz bag of cookies, but that would exceed your calorie target. You can only consume enough servings to stay within your calorie limit. 

To find the maximum ounces you can eat without exceeding your calorie limit, you can only consume 1200 calories worth of cookies, which is 6 servings (or 180 oz), but since the bag only has 150 oz, you can eat the entire bag. 

Thus, the answer is:
You can eat **150 oz** of cookies, but that would exceed your calorie limit. You should limit your intake to stay within your calorie target.",150.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

2. Next, we need to find out how many calories are in one serving of cookies.
   - Each serving has 200 calories.

3. Now, we can calculate how many servings can be consumed with the remaining calories.
   - Remaining calories: 1200 calories
   - Calories per serving: 200 calories

   The number of servings that can be consumed is:

1. Kayla received 43 new potted plants from the nursery.
2. She already has 12 potted plants on each of the 65 window ledges.
   - To find the total number of potted plants she already has, we calculate:
     \( 12 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 65 \text{ ledges} = 780 \text{ plants} \).
3. Now, we add the new plants she received:
   - Total plants after receiving new ones:
     \( 780 + 43 = 823 \text{ plants} \).
4. She purchased 140 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount. However, the discount does not affect the total number of plants she has, so we simply add these plants:
   - Total plants after the purchase:
     \( 823 + 140 = 963 \text{ plants} \).
5. Kayla plans to give away 4 potted plants from each ledge. Since she has 65 ledges, the total number of plants she will give away is:
   - Total plants given away:

Next, we know that the fog bank takes 41 minutes to cover every 3 miles. We can calculate how many 3-mile segments are in 6 miles:

\[
\text{Number of 3-mile segments in 6 miles} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 2 \text{ segments}

On Wednesday, he got to stay up late, so he watched two 5-hour episodes. On Thursday, he watched four episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 24 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?",5.0,"To find out how many 15-minute episodes Noah watched on Monday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he spent watching TV from Saturday to Thursday, and then determine how much time was left for Monday.

1. **Saturday and Sunday:**
   - He watched 4 hours each night for 2 nights.
   - Total time for Saturday and Sunday:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Monday:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of 15-minute episodes he watched on Monday.
   - Each 15-minute episode is \( \frac{15}{60} = \frac{1}{4} \) hours.
   - Therefore, the total time spent on Monday is:
     \[
     \frac{x}{4} \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Tuesday:**
   - He watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show.
   - Total time for Tuesday:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} + 0.75 \text{ hours} = 3.75 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Wednesday:**
   - He watched two 5-hour episodes.
   - Total time for Wednesday:
     \[
     2 \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Thursday:**
   - He watched four 15-minute episodes.
   - Total time for Thursday:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{15}{60} = 4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1 \text{ hour}
     \]

Now, we can sum the total time spent watching TV from Saturday to Thursday:

\[
\text{Total time} = 8 \text{ hours (Saturday and Sunday)} + \frac{x}{4} \text{ hours (Monday)} + 3.75 \text{ hours (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ hours (Wednesday)} + 1 \text{ hour (Thursday)}
\]

This gives us the equation:

\[
8 + \frac{x}{4} + 3.75 + 10 + 1 = 24
\]

Now, we simplify the left side:

\[
8 + 3.75 + 10 + 1 = 22.75
\]

So, we have:

\[
22.75 + \frac{x}{4} = 24
\]

Subtracting 22.75 from both sides:

\[
\frac{x}{4} = 24 - 22.75
\]
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 1.25
\]

Now, multiplying both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 1.25 \times 4 = 5
\]

Thus, Noah watched **5 episodes** of the 15-minute show on Monday.",15.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total hours Noah watched on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - He watched 4-hour episodes each night for 2 nights.
   - Total for Saturday and Sunday = 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours.

2. **Calculate the total hours watched on Tuesday:**
   - He watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show.
   - Convert 45 minutes to hours: 45 minutes = 0.75 hours.
   - Total for Tuesday = 3 hours + 0.75 hours = 3.75 hours.

3. **Calculate the total hours watched on Wednesday:**
   - He watched two 5-hour episodes.
   - Total for Wednesday = 5 hours + 5 hours = 10 hours.

4. **Calculate the total hours watched on Thursday:**
   - He watched four 15-minute episodes.
   - Convert 15 minutes to hours: 15 minutes = 0.25 hours.
   - Total for Thursday = 4 * 0.25 hours = 1 hour.

5. **Now, add up all the hours watched from Saturday to Thursday:**
   - Total hours = 8 hours (Saturday and Sunday) + 3.75 hours (Tuesday) + 10 hours (Wednesday) + 1 hour (Thursday).
   - Total hours = 8 + 3.75 + 10 + 1 = 22.75 hours.

6. **Now, we know he watched a total of 24 hours of TV.**
   - To find out how many hours he watched on Monday, we subtract the total hours from the total TV hours:
   - Hours watched on Monday = 24 hours - 22.75 hours = 1.25 hours.

7. **Convert 1.25 hours to minutes to find out how many 15-minute episodes he watched:**
   - 1.25 hours = 1 hour and 15 minutes = 60 minutes + 15 minutes = 75 minutes.

8. **Now, divide the total minutes by the length of each episode:**

If she used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.",504.0,"To solve the problem, we need to break down the information given and set up equations based on the ratios provided.

1. **Understanding the Ratios**:
   - The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 63:14.
   - The ratio of tablespoons of milk to cups of water is 9:7.

2. **Let’s define variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of cups of water used.
   - From the ratio of sugar to water, the amount of sugar used can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{sugar} = \frac{63}{14} \cdot x = \frac{63x}{14} = 4.5x
     \]
   - From the ratio of milk to water, the amount of milk used can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{milk} = \frac{9}{7} \cdot x
     \]

3. **Total Amount Used**:
   - The total amount of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk is given as 760. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     \text{sugar} + \text{water} + \text{milk} = 760
     \]
   - Substituting the expressions for sugar and milk:
     \[
     4.5x + x + \frac{9}{7}x = 760
     \]

4. **Combining Terms**:
   - First, combine the terms involving \( x \):
     \[
     4.5x + x = 5.5x
     \]
   - Now, we need to combine \( 5.5x \) and \( \frac{9}{7}x \):
     - To do this, we convert \( 5.5 \) to a fraction:
       \[
       5.5 = \frac{11}{2}
       \]
     - Now, we find a common denominator to combine \( \frac{11}{2}x \) and \( \frac{9}{7}x \). The least common multiple of 2 and 7 is 14.
     - Convert both fractions:
       \[
       \frac{11}{2} = \frac{77}{14}, \quad \frac{9}{7} = \frac{18}{14}
       \]
     - Now combine:
       \[
       \frac{77}{14}x + \frac{18}{14}x = \frac{95}{14}x
       \]

5. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - Now we have:
     \[
     \frac{95}{14}x = 760
     \]

6. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - Multiply both sides by 14 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     95x = 760 \times 14
     \]
   - Calculate \( 760 \times 14 \):
     \[
     760 \times 14 = 10640
     \]
   - Now divide by 95:
     \[
     x = \frac{10640}{95} = 112
     \]

7. **Calculating the Amount of Sugar**:
   - Now that we have \( x = 112 \) (the number of cups of water), we can find the amount of sugar:
     \[
     \text{sugar} = 4.5x = 4.5 \times 112 = 504
     \]

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Fatima used is \( \boxed{504} \).",504.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Understanding the ratios**: Fatima uses sugar and water in the ratio of 63:14. This means for every 63 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 14 cups of water.

2. **Finding the total parts in the sugar and water ratio**: 
   - Total parts = 63 (sugar) + 14 (water) = 77 parts.

3. **Finding the total amount of sugar and water used**: 
   - Let \( x \) be the multiplier for the ratio. 
   - Then, the amount of sugar used is \( 63x \) teaspoons and the amount of water used is \( 14x \) cups.

4. **Understanding the milk ratio**: Fatima uses 9 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water. 

5. **Finding the total parts in the milk and water ratio**: 
   - Total parts = 9 (milk) + 7 (water) = 16 parts.

6. **Finding the total amount of milk used**: 
   - Let \( y \) be the multiplier for the milk and water ratio. 
   - Then, the amount of milk used is \( 9y \) tablespoons and the amount of water used is \( 7y \) cups.

7. **Setting up the equation for total ingredients**: 
   - The total amount of ingredients used is given as 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk. 
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   63x + 14x + 7y + 9y = 760
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   77x + 16y = 760
   \]

8. **Finding the relationship between \( x \) and \( y \)**: 
   - From the milk and water ratio, we know that the amount of water used in both cases must be equal:
   \[
   14x = 7y \implies y = 2x
   \]

9. **Substituting \( y \) in the total ingredients equation**: 
   - Substitute \( y = 2x \) into the equation:
   \[
   77x + 16(2x) = 760
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   77x + 32x = 760 \implies 109x = 760
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{760}{109} \approx 6.976
   \]

10. **Calculating the amount of sugar used**: 
    - Now, we can find the amount of sugar used:
    \[
    \text{Sugar} = 63x \approx 63 \times 6.976 \approx 439.488 \text{ teaspoons}
    \]

Since we are looking for the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used, we can round this to the nearest whole number.

3. First, let's find the total parts in the ratio of sugar to water:
   - The total parts for sugar and water is 63 + 14 = 77 parts.

4. Now, we need to express the total amount of sugar, water, and milk in terms of these parts. We know the total is 760 teaspoons.

5. To find the value of one part, we divide the total amount by the total parts:
   - One part = 760 / 77 ≈ 9.87 teaspoons.

6. Now, we can find the amount of sugar used:
   - Sugar = 63 parts * 9.87 teaspoons/part ≈ 622.81 teaspoons.

   \[
   \text{Cost of notebooks} = 12 \text{ notebooks} \times ₣2.75/\text{notebook} = ₣33.00
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the rulers:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of rulers} = 6 \text{ rulers} \times ₣9.00/\text{ruler} = ₣54.00
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the bond paper:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of bond paper} = ₣10.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the crayons:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of crayons} = 3 \text{ crayons} \times ₣11.00/\text{crayon} = ₣33.00
   \]

5. **Sum the total costs:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of notebooks} + \text{Cost of rulers} + \text{Cost of bond paper} + \text{Cost of crayons}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = ₣33.00 + ₣54.00 + ₣10.00 + ₣33.00 = ₣130.00
   \]

6. **Calculate the discount:**
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 10\% \text{ of Total cost} = 0.10 \times ₣130.00 = ₣13.00
   \]

7. **Calculate the final amount spent after discount:**
   \[
   \text{Final amount} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final amount} = ₣130.00 - ₣13.00 = ₣117.00
   \]

Thus, Arjun spent **₣117.00** on everything after the discount.",117.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the notebooks:**
   - Arjun bought 12 notebooks.
   - Each notebook costs ₣2.75.
   - So, the total cost for the notebooks is:
     \[
     12 \times 2.75 = 33.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the rulers:**
   - Arjun bought 6 rulers.
   - Each ruler costs ₣9.00.
   - So, the total cost for the rulers is:
     \[
     6 \times 9.00 = 54.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the bond paper:**
   - The cost of the rim of bond paper is ₣10.00.

4. **Calculate the cost of the crayons:**
   - Arjun bought 3 crayons.
   - Each crayon costs ₣11.00.
   - So, the total cost for the crayons is:
     \[
     3 \times 11.00 = 33.00
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost before discount:**
   - Now, we add all the costs together:
     \[
     33.00 \, (\text{notebooks}) + 54.00 \, (\text{rulers}) + 10.00 \, (\text{bond paper}) + 33.00 \, (\text{crayons}) = 130.00
     \]

6. **Calculate the discount:**
   - Arjun receives a 10% discount on the total cost.
   - The discount amount is:
     \[
     10\% \text{ of } 130.00 = 0.10 \times 130.00 = 13.00
     \]

7. **Calculate the total cost after discount:**
   - Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:

How much more money will she have if she hires a financial advisor?",1148.0,"To determine how much more money Isabella will have if she hires a financial advisor instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to calculate the total cost of doing her taxes herself and compare it to the cost of hiring a financial advisor.

1. **Calculate the total lost income if she does her taxes herself:**
   - She will lose 12 hours of consulting work.
   - The income lost from these 12 hours is:
     \[
     \text{Lost income from consulting} = 12 \text{ hours} \times ₣82/\text{hour} = ₣984

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,Luis is rolling a 20-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row?,43.75,"To solve the problem, we need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 on a 20-sided die, and the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 10:**
   A 20-sided die has the numbers 1 through 20. The numbers greater than 10 are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. 

   There are 10 numbers greater than 10. Therefore, the probability \( P(\text{greater than 10}) \) is:
   \[
   P(\text{greater than 10}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
   \]

2. **Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row:**
   The odd numbers on a 20-sided die are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19. There are 10 odd numbers.

   The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is:
   \[
   P(\text{odd}) = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
   \]

   Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row is:
   \[
   P(\text{four odd numbers}) = P(\text{odd})^4 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16}
   \]

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   Now we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 10 compared to rolling four odd numbers in a row. We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Difference in probabilities} = P(\text{greater than 10}) - P(\text{four odd numbers}) = 0.5 - \frac{1}{16}
   \]

   To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The common denominator of 1 and 16 is 16. Thus, we convert 0.5 to a fraction with a denominator of 16:
   \[
   0.5 = \frac{8}{16}
   \]

   Now we can subtract:
   \[
   \frac{8}{16} - \frac{1}{16} = \frac{8 - 1}{16} = \frac{7}{16}
   \]

4. **Expressing the difference as a percentage:**
   To express \(\frac{7}{16}\) as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
   \[
   \frac{7}{16} \times 100 = 43.75\%
   \]

Thus, Luis is **43.75%** more likely to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll four odd numbers in a row.",10.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 on a 20-sided die.**
   - The numbers on a 20-sided die are 1 through 20.
   - The numbers greater than 10 are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
   - There are 10 numbers greater than 10.
   - The total number of outcomes when rolling the die is 20.
   - So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is:
     \[
     P(\text{greater than 10}) = \frac{10}{20} = 0.5
     \]

2. **Determine the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row.**
   - The odd numbers on a 20-sided die are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19.
   - There are 10 odd numbers.
   - The probability of rolling an odd number on one roll is:
     \[
     P(\text{odd}) = \frac{10}{20} = 0.5
     \]
   - To find the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row, we multiply the probabilities of rolling an odd number for each of the four rolls:
     \[
     P(\text{four odd numbers}) = P(\text{odd})^4 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16} = 0.0625
     \]

3. **Calculate how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll four odd numbers in a row.**
   - We need to find the difference in probabilities:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = P(\text{greater than 10}) - P(\text{four odd numbers}) = 0.5 - 0.0625 = 0.4375
     \]

4. **Convert this difference into a percentage.**
   - To express the difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

He can write a page every 14 minutes. On average, how many hours does Yuki spend writing in a day?",4.0,"To find out how many hours Yuki spends writing in a day, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Yuki is still in contact with:**
   - Yuki originally had 8 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 4 of them.
   - Therefore, the number of pen pals he still has is:
     \[
     8 - 4 = 4
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of letters sent per week:**
   - Each pen pal sends 3 letters a week.
   - With 4 pen pals, the total number of letters sent per week is:
     \[
     4 \text{ pen pals} \times 3 \text{ letters/pen pal} = 12 \text{ letters/week}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pages Yuki receives per week:**

   - Therefore, the total number of pages Yuki receives per week is:
     \[
     12 \text{ letters/week} \times 10 \text{ pages/letter} = 120 \text{ pages/week}
     \]

4. **Determine the total number of pages Yuki writes in response:**
   - Yuki responds in kind, so he also writes 120 pages per week.

5. **Calculate the time Yuki spends writing these pages:**
   - Yuki can write 1 page in 14 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time in minutes he spends writing 120 pages is:

The answer is that the total cost will be $65,000 more than Ms. Johnson's budget.",65000.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The selling price of the property is $500,000.
2. Ms. Johnson can get a 10% discount on the selling price.
   - The discount amount is 10% of $500,000, which is calculated as:
     \[
     0.10 \times 500,000 = 50,000
     \]
   - Therefore, the discounted price is:
     \[
     500,000 - 50,000 = 450,000

3. Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee, which is 4% of the selling price:
   - The brokerage fee is:
     \[
     0.04 \times 500,000 = 20,000
     \]

4. Now, we calculate the transfer fee, which is 13% of the selling price:
   - The transfer fee is:
     \[
     0.13 \times 500,000 = 65,000

1. **Calculate the cost of one round of laser tag for Emma and her friends:**
   - Cost of one round of laser tag: €6
   - Cost of pinball tokens for each person: €4
   - Cost of roller coaster rides for each person: €10 per ride × 3 rides = €30

   Total cost per person for activities:

If there are three times the number of boys in the playground, what percentage of the kids in the playground are girls?",25.0,"To find the percentage of kids in the playground that are girls, we first need to determine the total number of kids, which includes both girls and boys.

1. **Identify the number of girls**: 
   There are 15 girls in the playground.

2. **Determine the number of boys**: 
   According to the problem, the number of boys is three times the number of girls. Therefore, we calculate the number of boys as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 3 \times \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 15 = 45
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of kids**: 
   The total number of kids in the playground is the sum of the number of girls and boys:
   \[
   \text{Total number of kids} = \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of boys} = 15 + 45 = 60
   \]

4. **Calculate the percentage of kids that are girls**: 
   To find the percentage of kids that are girls, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of girls} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of girls}}{\text{Total number of kids}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of girls} = \left( \frac{15}{60} \right) \times 100
   \]

5. **Perform the calculation**:
   \[
   \frac{15}{60} = 0.25
   \]
   Now, multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:
   \[
   0.25 \times 100 = 25

How much does he earn in a year after paying 25% in taxes?,1296.0,"To calculate the carpenter's earnings in a year after paying 25% in taxes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of working days in a month:**
   The carpenter works for 2 weeks every month, and since he works 6 days a week:
   \[
   \text{Working days per month} = 2 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 12 \text{ days}

1. **Initial Count of Kiwis**:
   Theo has 25 kiwis.

2. **Initial Count of Pineapples**:
   According to the problem, there are eight times as many pineapples as kiwis. Therefore, the number of pineapples is:
   \[
   \text{Pineapples} = 8 \times \text{Kiwis} = 8 \times 25 = 200

3. **Kiwis After Purchase**:
   Theo bought 63 more kiwis. So, the new total of kiwis is:
   \[
   \text{New Kiwis} = 25 + 63 = 88

4. **Pineapples After Purchase**:
   Theo bought 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis he now has. Therefore, the number of pineapples he bought is:
   \[
   \text{Pineapples Bought} = \text{New Kiwis} - 19 = 88 - 19 = 69
   \]
   Now, we add this to the initial count of pineapples:

1. **Cost of Saltwater Taffy:**
   - The deal is ""Buy 16 kgs at $23 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/2 off.""
   - First, calculate the cost for the first 16 kgs:
     \[
     16 \text{ kgs} \times 23 \text{ dollars/kg} = 368 \text{ dollars}

   - Now, for the additional 4 kgs, since they are half off:
     \[
     4 \text{ kgs} \times \left(\frac{23}{2}\right) \text{ dollars/kg} = 4 \text{ kgs} \times 11.5 \text{ dollars/kg} = 46 \text{ dollars}

1. Ananya starts with $1200.
2. She buys 23 kgs of saltwater taffy. The price is structured as follows:
   - For the first 16 kgs, the cost is 16 kgs * $23/kg = $368.
   - For the next 4 kgs, she gets them at half price. The price for 4 kgs at half price is:
     - Regular price for 4 kgs = 4 kgs * $23/kg = $92.
     - Half price = $92 / 2 = $46.
   - For the remaining 3 kgs, the cost is 3 kgs * $23/kg = $69.
   - So, the total cost for the taffy is $368 + $46 + $69 = $483.

3. Next, Ananya buys a mixed bag of starfish for $11.0.
4. Then, she buys 17 keychains at $20.0 each. The total cost for the keychains is:
   - 17 keychains * $20.0/keychain = $340.

5. Now, let's calculate the total amount spent:

   3\% \text{ of } 10000 \text{ cents} = 0.03 \times 10000 = 300 \text{ cents}
   \]
7. Now, we can find out how much money he actually spent by subtracting the change from his initial amount:
   \[
   10000 \text{ cents} - 300 \text{ cents} = 9700 \text{ cents}
   \]
8. We already calculated that he spent 5200 cents on crackers and pretzels. Now we can find out how much he spent on gum:
   \[
   9700 \text{ cents} - 5200 \text{ cents} = 4500 \text{ cents}
   \]
9. The cost of gum is 100 cents per pack. To find out how many packs of gum he bought, we divide the total amount spent on gum by the cost per pack:
   \[
   4500 \text{ cents} \div 100 \text{ cents/pack} = 45 \text{ packs}

If the length of his room is 16 feet longer that its width, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?",68.0,"Let the width of Kai's office be denoted as \( w \) feet. According to the problem, the length \( l \) of the office is 16 feet longer than the width, so we can express the length as:

\[
l = w + 16
\]

The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[
A = l \times w
\]

We know the area of the office is 225 square feet, so we can set up the equation:

\[
w \times (w + 16) = 225
\]

Expanding this equation gives:

\[
w^2 + 16w = 225
\]

To solve for \( w \), we rearrange the equation:

\[
w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0
\]

Now, we can use the quadratic formula to find the values of \( w \). The quadratic formula is given by:

\[
w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

In our equation, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 16 \), and \( c = -225 \). Plugging in these values:

\[
w = \frac{-16 \pm \sqrt{16^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-225)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]

Calculating the discriminant:

\[
16^2 = 256
\]
\[
-4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-225) = 900
\]
\[
b^2 - 4ac = 256 + 900 = 1156
\]

Now, taking the square root:

\[
\sqrt{1156} = 34
\]

Substituting back into the quadratic formula:

\[
w = \frac{-16 \pm 34}{2}
\]

Calculating the two possible values for \( w \):

1. \( w = \frac{-16 + 34}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
2. \( w = \frac{-16 - 34}{2} = \frac{-50}{2} = -25 \) (not a valid solution since width cannot be negative)

Thus, the width \( w \) is 9 feet. Now we can find the length:

\[
l = w + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we can calculate the perimeter \( P \) of the rectangle using the formula:

\[
P = 2l + 2w
\]

Substituting the values of \( l \) and \( w \):

\[
P = 2(25) + 2(9) = 50 + 18 = 68 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, the perimeter of Kai's office is:

\[
\boxed{68} \text{ feet}

4. Expanding this equation gives:
   \[
   w^2 + 16w = 225
   \]
5. Rearranging the equation to set it to zero:
   \[
   w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0
   \]
6. Now, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for \( w \):
   \[
   w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 16 \), and \( c = -225 \).
7. Calculating the discriminant:
   \[
   b^2 - 4ac = 16^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-225) = 256 + 900 = 1156

   \[
   w = \frac{-16 \pm \sqrt{1156}}{2 \times 1}

   \[
   w = \frac{-16 \pm 34}{2}

9. This gives us two possible solutions for \( w \):
   \[
   w = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \quad \text{(valid, since width must be positive)}

   \[
   w = \frac{-50}{2} = -25 \quad \text{(not valid)}

     4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ kg}
     \]
   - **Carrots:** 11 bags of 9 kg each

   - Yuki has 2/4 (which simplifies to 1/2) as many tubes of pink paint as Sanjay.
   - So, Yuki has \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) tubes of pink paint.

3. **Calculate how many tubes of blue paint Yuki has:**
   - Yuki has thrice as many tubes of blue paint as Sanjay.
   - So, Yuki has \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) tubes of blue paint.

4. **Calculate the total number of pink tubes for Sanjay and Yuki:**
   - Total pink tubes = Sanjay's pink tubes + Yuki's pink tubes
   - Total pink tubes = \( 10 + 5 = 15 \) tubes.

5. **Calculate the total number of blue tubes for Sanjay and Yuki:**
   - Total blue tubes = Sanjay's blue tubes + Yuki's blue tubes
   - Total blue tubes = \( 3 + 9 = 12 \) tubes.

6. **Calculate how many tubes of black paint Andre has:**
   - Andre has six times as many tubes of black paint as the combined number of pink tubes that Sanjay and Yuki have.
   - So, Andre has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) tubes of black paint.

7. **Calculate how many tubes of white paint Andre has:**
   - Andre has 6 fewer tubes of white paint than the combined number of blue tubes that Sanjay and Yuki have.
   - So, Andre has \( 12 - 6 = 6 \) tubes of white paint.

8. **Calculate the total number of tubes of paint Andre has:**
   - Total tubes of paint = black tubes + white tubes
   - Total tubes of paint = \( 90 + 6 = 96 \).

Deshawn has 615 crackers, 11 bowls and 4 plates. Deshawn then eats a third of the crackers. How many crackers won't he be able to place on the bowls or plates?",11.0,"To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the capacity of the plates**: 
   Each bowl can hold 21 crackers. Since each plate can hold two times that, we calculate the capacity of one plate:
   \[
   \text{Capacity of one plate} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ crackers}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and plates**:
   Deshawn has 11 bowls and 4 plates. We calculate the total capacity:
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of bowls} = 11 \times 21 = 231 \text{ crackers}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of plates} = 4 \times 42 = 168 \text{ crackers}
   \]
   Now, we add the capacities of the bowls and plates together:
   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = 231 + 168 = 399 \text{ crackers}
   \]

3. **Determine how many crackers Deshawn has after eating**:
   Deshawn starts with 615 crackers and eats a third of them. First, we calculate how many crackers he eats:
   \[
   \text{Crackers eaten} = \frac{1}{3} \times 615 = 205 \text{ crackers}
   \]
   Now, we find out how many crackers he has left:
   \[
   \text{Crackers left} = 615 - 205 = 410 \text{ crackers}
   \]

4. **Determine how many crackers cannot be placed**:
   Now we compare the number of crackers he has left (410) with the total capacity of the bowls and plates (399). The number of crackers that cannot be placed is:
   \[
   \text{Crackers that cannot be placed} = 410 - 399 = 11 \text{ crackers}

   \]

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and plates**:
   - Deshawn has 11 bowls, so the total capacity of the bowls is:
   \[
   11 \times 21 = 231 \text{ crackers}
   \]
   - Deshawn has 4 plates, so the total capacity of the plates is:
   \[
   4 \times 42 = 168 \text{ crackers}
   \]
   - Therefore, the total capacity of both bowls and plates combined is:
   \[
   231 + 168 = 399 \text{ crackers}

3. **Determine how many crackers Deshawn eats**: Deshawn has 615 crackers and eats a third of them. The number of crackers he eats is:
   \[
   \frac{615}{3} = 205 \text{ crackers}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining crackers after eating**: The number of crackers left after Deshawn eats is:
   \[
   615 - 205 = 410 \text{ crackers}
   \]

5. **Determine how many crackers cannot be placed**: Now, we need to find out how many crackers he won't be able to place on the bowls or plates. Since he has 410 crackers and the total capacity of the bowls and plates is 399 crackers, the number of crackers that won't fit is:

2. **Warm Water Swimming Time:**
   - Carlos swims 1 kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times the time it takes in cold water.
   - The time taken in cold water for 1 kilometer is 11 minutes, so:
     \[
     \text{Time for 1 km in warm water} = 4 \times 11 \text{ minutes} + 9 \text{ minutes} = 44 \text{ minutes} + 9 \text{ minutes} = 53 \text{ minutes}

He gets 2 hours free, so he only pays for 4 - 2 = 2 hours.  
The first paid hour costs $50.  
The second hour costs twice the first hour, which is 2 * $50 = $100.  
So, the total cost for the 2 paid hours is $50 + $100 = $150.  
Additionally, there is a fixed insurance cost of $25.

On average, how many pages does she have left to write per day?",11.0,"To find out how many pages Olga has left to write per day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pages she has already written**:
   Since Olga has completed \( \frac{3}{4} \) of her 176-page thesis, we can calculate the number of pages she has written as follows:
   \[
   \text{Pages written} = \frac{3}{4} \times 176
   \]
   \[
   \text{Pages written} = \frac{3 \times 176}{4} = \frac{528}{4} = 132
   \]

2. **Determine the number of pages left to write**:
   To find out how many pages she has left to write, we subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages:
   \[
   \text{Pages left} = 176 - 132 = 44
   \]

3. **Calculate the average number of pages she needs to write per day**:
   Olga has 4 days left to complete her thesis. We can find the average number of pages she needs to write each day by dividing the number of pages left by the number of days remaining:
   \[
   \text{Pages per day} = \frac{\text{Pages left}}{\text{Days left}} = \frac{44}{4} = 11

He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 40% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of flour and he uses 3 kilograms of flour per day. He also decided to buy himself a bagel for ₣4. Since he shopped more than ₣50, he received a ₣23 discount. How much does Santiago have to pay?",275.0,"To find out how much Santiago has to pay, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive flour:**
   - The normal brand costs ₣10 per kilogram.
   - The more expensive brand costs 40% more than the normal brand.
   - To find the cost of the more expensive brand:
     \[
     \text{Cost of more expensive flour} = \text{Normal cost} + (0.40 \times \text{Normal cost}) = ₣10 + (0.40 \times ₣10) = ₣10 + ₣4 = ₣14 \text{ per kilogram}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of flour Santiago needs for a week:**
   - Santiago uses 3 kilograms of flour per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he needs:
     \[
     \text{Total flour needed} = 3 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ kg}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the flour:**
   - The total cost for 21 kilograms of the more expensive flour is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of flour} = 21 \text{ kg} \times ₣14/\text{kg} = ₣294
     \]

4. **Add the cost of the bagel:**
   - The cost of the bagel is ₣4.
   - Therefore, the total cost before any discounts is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost before discount} = ₣294 + ₣4 = ₣298

5. **Apply the discount:**
   - Santiago receives a discount of ₣23 because his total shopping was more than ₣50.
   - The total cost after the discount is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost after discount} = ₣298 - ₣23 = ₣275

4. The normal brand of flour costs ₣10 per kilogram.
5. The more expensive brand costs 40% more than the normal brand.
6. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we calculate 40% of ₣10:
   - 40% of ₣10 = 0.40 * 10 = ₣4.

   - Total water used for giant cubes = \( 8 \times 12 = 96 \) grams.

2. **Medium Cubes**:
   - Each medium cube uses 11 grams of water.

- \( B = 34 \) (students who like to bake)
- \( H = 6 \) (students who like to play hurling)
- The total number of students is \( 160 \).
- The number of students who like to read is given by the equation \( R = 4H - 3 \).

How much money is Yuki missing if he has ¥15 and the music festival costs ¥490?",181.0,"To find out how much money Yuki is missing, we first need to determine how much of the music festival's cost is being covered by the youth club and his friends.

1. **Calculate the contribution from the youth club:**
   The youth club is covering a tenth of the cost of the music festival.
   \[
   \text{Youth club's contribution} = \frac{1}{10} \times 490 = 49 \text{ yen}

2. **Calculate the contribution from Yuki's friends:**
   His friends are covering half of the cost of the music festival.
   \[
   \text{Friends' contribution} = \frac{1}{2} \times 490 = 245 \text{ yen}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total contributions:**
   Now, we add the contributions from the youth club and his friends.
   \[
   \text{Total contributions} = 49 + 245 = 294 \text{ yen}
   \]

4. **Calculate how much Yuki needs to cover:**
   To find out how much Yuki needs to cover, we subtract the total contributions from the total cost of the music festival.
   \[
   \text{Amount Yuki needs to cover} = 490 - 294 = 196 \text{ yen}
   \]

5. **Determine how much Yuki is missing:**
   Yuki currently has ¥15. We need to find out how much more he needs.
   \[
   \text{Amount Yuki is missing} = 196 - 15 = 181 \text{ yen}
   \]

Thus, Yuki is missing **¥181**.",181.0,1,"Let's think step by step.  
The total cost of the music festival is ¥490.  
Yuki has ¥15.  

First, we need to find out how much money the youth club will cover.  
The youth club covers a tenth of the cost:  
1/10 of ¥490 = ¥490 / 10 = ¥49.  

Next, we find out how much money Yuki's friends will cover.  
His friends cover half of the cost:  
1/2 of ¥490 = ¥490 / 2 = ¥245.  

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money covered by the youth club and his friends:  
Total covered = Amount covered by youth club + Amount covered by friends  
Total covered = ¥49 + ¥245 = ¥294.  

Now, we add the amount Yuki has to the total covered:  
Total amount available = Amount Yuki has + Total covered  
Total amount available = ¥15 + ¥294 = ¥309.  

Finally, we need to find out how much money Yuki is missing:  
Missing amount = Total cost - Total amount available  
Missing amount = ¥490 - ¥309 = ¥181.

   There are 21 goats, so the total grain needed for the goats is:
   \[
   \text{Grain for goats} = 21 \text{ goats} \times 9 \text{ kg/goat} = 189 \text{ kg}
   \]

2. **Calculate the grain needed for the alpacas:**
   Each alpaca needs 3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs. 
   First, we calculate twice the amount each goat needs:
   \[
   2 \times 9 \text{ kg} = 18 \text{ kg}
   \]
   Now, subtract 3 kilograms:
   \[
   18 \text{ kg} - 3 \text{ kg} = 15 \text{ kg}
   \]
   Each alpaca needs 15 kilograms of grain. 
   There are 7 alpacas, so the total grain needed for the alpacas is:
   \[
   \text{Grain for alpacas} = 7 \text{ alpacas} \times 15 \text{ kg/alpaca} = 105 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. **Calculate the grain needed for the cows:**
   Each cow eats as much as a goat and an alpaca eat combined. 
   We already know the grain needed for a goat (9 kg) and for an alpaca (15 kg). 
   Therefore, the total grain needed for one cow is:
   \[
   \text{Grain for one cow} = 9 \text{ kg} + 15 \text{ kg} = 24 \text{ kg}
   \]
   There are 21 cows, so the total grain needed for the cows is:
   \[
   \text{Grain for cows} = 21 \text{ cows} \times 24 \text{ kg/cow} = 504 \text{ kg}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total grain needed:**
   Now, we sum the grain needed for all types of livestock:
   \[
   \text{Total grain} = \text{Grain for goats} + \text{Grain for alpacas} + \text{Grain for cows}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total grain} = 189 \text{ kg} + 105 \text{ kg} + 504 \text{ kg} = 798 \text{ kg}
   \]

Thus, Alejandro needs a total of **798 kilograms** of grain.",798.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of grain needed for each goat:**
   Each goat needs 9 kilograms of grain.

2. **Calculate the amount of grain needed for each alpaca:**
   Each alpaca needs 3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount for a goat: 2 * 9 = 18 kilograms.
   - So, each alpaca needs: 18 - 3 = 15 kilograms.

3. **Calculate the amount of grain needed for each cow:**
   Each cow eats as much as a goat and an alpaca eat combined.
   - Grain for one goat: 9 kilograms.
   - Grain for one alpaca: 15 kilograms.
   - So, each cow needs: 9 + 15 = 24 kilograms.

4. **Calculate the total amount of grain needed for all goats:**
   There are 21 goats.
   - Total for goats: 21 * 9 = 189 kilograms.

5. **Calculate the total amount of grain needed for all alpacas:**
   There are 7 alpacas.
   - Total for alpacas: 7 * 15 = 105 kilograms.

6. **Calculate the total amount of grain needed for all cows:**
   There are 21 cows.
   - Total for cows: 21 * 24 = 504 kilograms.

7. **Calculate the total amount of grain needed for all livestock:**
   - Total grain needed = Total for goats + Total for alpacas + Total for cows
   - Total grain needed = 189 + 105 + 504 = 798 kilograms.

Due to the flu season, 35 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.",50.0,"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of occupied beds**:
   The hospital has a total of 800 beds, and \( \frac{1}{8} \) of them are occupied.
   \[
   \text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{8} \times 800 = 100 \text{ beds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of beds out of service**:
   One-fifth of all the beds are out of service.
   \[
   \text{Out of service beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 800 = 160 \text{ beds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of beds that are either occupied or out of service**:
   \[
   \text{Total occupied or out of service} = \text{Occupied beds} + \text{Out of service beds} = 100 + 160 = 260 \text{ beds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of unoccupied beds**:
   The total number of unoccupied beds is the total number of beds minus the total occupied or out of service beds.
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied beds} = \text{Total beds} - \text{Total occupied or out of service} = 800 - 260 = 540 \text{ beds}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks**:
   There are 35 patients admitted each day. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted is:
   \[
   \text{Total patients admitted} = 35 \times 14 = 490 \text{ patients}
   \]

6. **Calculate the new number of occupied beds after 2 weeks**:
   The new number of occupied beds will be the initial occupied beds plus the number of patients admitted.
   \[
   \text{New occupied beds} = \text{Initial occupied beds} + \text{Total patients admitted} = 100 + 490 = 590 \text{ beds}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks**:
   We need to consider the total number of beds that are out of service remains the same (160 beds).
   The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is 590, so the total number of unoccupied beds is:
   \[
   \text{Total unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = \text{Total beds} - (\text{New occupied beds} + \text{Out of service beds})
   \]
   \[
   = 800 - (590 + 160) = 800 - 750 = 50 \text{ beds}
   \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is \( \boxed{50} \).",50.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. The hospital has a total capacity of 800 beds.
2. First, we need to find out how many beds are occupied. Since 1/8 of the beds are occupied:
   \[
   \text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{8} \times 800 = 100 \text{ beds}
   \]

3. Next, we find out how many beds are out of service. One-fifth of all the beds are out of service:
   \[
   \text{Out of service beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 800 = 160 \text{ beds}
   \]

4. Now, we can calculate the total number of beds that are either occupied or out of service:
   \[
   \text{Total occupied and out of service beds} = 100 + 160 = 260 \text{ beds}
   \]

5. To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total occupied and out of service beds from the total capacity:
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied beds} = 800 - 260 = 540 \text{ beds}
   \]

6. Now, we need to account for the 35 patients admitted each day for 2 weeks (14 days):
   \[
   \text{Total patients admitted} = 35 \times 14 = 490 \text{ patients}
   \]

7. Finally, we subtract the total patients admitted from the unoccupied beds to find the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:

On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday and 28 boxes of orange pie. On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the cupcake cost ₺10 and the orange pie cost ₺22, how much was Andre's average daily earning?",980.0,"To find Andre's average daily earning, we first need to determine how many boxes of cupcakes and orange pies he sold each day.

### Step 1: Determine the sales for Monday
- **Cupcakes sold on Monday**: 24 boxes
- **Orange pies sold on Monday**: Since he sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pies than on Tuesday, we need to find out how many he sold on Tuesday first.

### Step 2: Determine the sales for Tuesday
- **Cupcakes sold on Tuesday**: He sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday.
  \[
  \text{Cupcakes on Tuesday} = 24 + 11 = 35 \text{ boxes}
  \]
- **Orange pies sold on Tuesday**: He sold 28 boxes of orange pies.

### Step 3: Calculate the orange pies sold on Monday
Since he sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pies on Monday than on Tuesday:
\[
\text{Orange pies on Monday} = 28 - 16 = 12 \text{ boxes}
\]

### Step 4: Determine the sales for Wednesday
On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. We need to calculate the total sales from Monday and Tuesday.

- **Total sales on Monday**:
  \[
  \text{Total on Monday} = \text{Cupcakes} + \text{Orange pies} = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ boxes}
  \]
- **Total sales on Tuesday**:
  \[
  \text{Total on Tuesday} = \text{Cupcakes} + \text{Orange pies} = 35 + 28 = 63 \text{ boxes}
  \]
- **Total sales for Monday and Tuesday combined**:
  \[
  \text{Total for Monday and Tuesday} = 36 + 63 = 99 \text{ boxes}
  \]
Thus, on Wednesday, he sold 99 boxes.

### Step 5: Calculate the earnings for each day
Now we calculate the earnings for each day based on the prices of cupcakes and orange pies.

- **Earnings on Monday**:
  - Cupcakes: \(24 \text{ boxes} \times ₺10 = ₺240\)
  - Orange pies: \(12 \text{ boxes} \times ₺22 = ₺264\)
  - Total earnings on Monday:
  \[
  ₺240 + ₺264 = ₺504
  \]

- **Earnings on Tuesday**:
  - Cupcakes: \(35 \text{ boxes} \times ₺10 = ₺350\)
  - Orange pies: \(28 \text{ boxes} \times ₺22 = ₺616\)
  - Total earnings on Tuesday:
  \[
  ₺350 + ₺616 = ₺966
  \]

- **Earnings on Wednesday**:
  - Total boxes sold: 99 boxes
  - Earnings from cupcakes: \(99 \text{ boxes} \times ₺10 = ₺990\)
  - Earnings from orange pies: \(0 \text{ boxes} \times ₺22 = ₺0\) (since we don't know the exact distribution, we assume all were cupcakes for simplicity)
  - Total earnings on Wednesday:
  \[
  ₺990 + ₺0 = ₺990
  \]

### Step 6: Calculate the total earnings over the three days
\[
\text{Total earnings} = ₺504 + ₺966 + ₺990 = ₺2460
\]

### Step 7: Calculate the average daily earning
To find the average daily earning, we divide the total earnings by the number of days (3):
\[
\text{Average daily earning} = \frac{₺2460}{3} = ₺820

2. **Width of Each Flower:**
   - Each flower grows 3 feet wide.

3. **Space Between Each Plant:**
   - Mei needs to leave 13 feet between every plant, which includes the width of the plant.

4. **Total Space Required for Each Plant:**
   - The total space required for each plant (width + space) is:
     \[
     3 \text{ feet (width)} + 13 \text{ feet (space)} = 16 \text{ feet}
     \]

5. **Calculating the Number of Plants:**
   - To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:
     \[
     \frac{143 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ feet}} \approx 8.9375
     \]
   - Since Mei can only plant whole flowers, she can plant 8 flowers.

6. **Calculating Additional Flowers Needed:**
   - Mei already owns 8 flowers, so she does not need to buy any additional flowers:
     \[
     8 \text{ (needed)} - 8 \text{ (owned)} = 0 \text{ (additional flowers needed)}
     \]

7. **Calculating the Cost:**
   - Since Mei does not need to buy any additional flowers, her total cost will be:
     \[
     0 \text{ (additional flowers)} \times €9 = €0
     \]

How long will it take her to peel and saute 60 clams if it takes 19 minutes to wash all the clams? Note that Yara can't work in parallel.,53.0,"To determine how long it will take Yara to peel and sauté 60 clams, we need to break down the tasks and calculate the time for each step.

1. **Washing the clams**: 
   - It takes Yara 19 minutes to wash all the clams.

2. **Peeling the clams**: 
   - Yara can peel 6 clams per minute.
   - For 60 clams, the time required to peel them is:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel} = \frac{60 \text{ clams}}{6 \text{ clams/min}} = 10 \text{ minutes}

3. **Sautéing the clams**: 
   - Yara can sauté 20 clams in 8 minutes.
   - To find out how long it takes to sauté 60 clams, we first determine how many batches of 20 clams are in 60 clams:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{60 \text{ clams}}{20 \text{ clams/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 8 minutes, the total time to sauté 60 clams is:
     \[
     \text{Time to sauté} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 8 \text{ minutes/batch} = 24 \text{ minutes}

Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet. How much older is Liam's uncle than Liam?,22.0,"Let \( u \) be the age of Liam's uncle when he first saw Comet Halley, which is 31 years old. 

Since Comet Halley orbits the Sun every 53 years, we can determine the age of Liam's uncle when he saw the comet for the second time. He will be:

\[
u + 53 = 31 + 53 = 84 \text{ years old}
\]

Now, let \( l \) be Liam's age when he first saw the comet. We know that Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was twice the age his uncle was when he first saw it. Therefore, we can express this as:

\[
\text{Liam's age when he saw the comet for the second time} = 2 \times u = 2 \times 31 = 62
\]

Let \( x \) be the number of years that pass from the time Liam first saw the comet until he saw it for the second time. Then, we can express Liam's age when he first saw the comet as:

\[
l + x = 62
\]

Since the uncle saw the comet 53 years after he first saw it, we have:

\[
x = 53
\]

Substituting \( x \) into the equation for Liam's age gives:

\[
l + 53 = 62
\]

Solving for \( l \):

\[
l = 62 - 53 = 9
\]

Now we know that Liam was 9 years old when he first saw the comet. To find out how much older Liam's uncle is than Liam, we calculate:

\[
\text{Age difference} = u - l = 31 - 9 = 22

Thus, Liam's uncle is \( \boxed{22} \) years older than Liam.",22.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Liam's uncle saw Comet Halley when he was 31 years old.
2. The comet orbits the Sun every 53 years, so when Liam's uncle saw it the first time, he was 31 years old.
3. Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet. This means Liam saw the comet when he was 2 * 31 = 62 years old.
4. Now, we need to find out how much older Liam's uncle is than Liam. 
5. Since Liam's uncle saw the comet when he was 31, and the comet appears every 53 years, we can calculate the uncle's age when Liam saw it for the second time:
   - Uncle's age when Liam saw it = 31 + 53 = 84 years old.

3. **Bananas picked on Wednesday**: 
   He picks quintuple the number of bananas he did on Monday:
   \[
   \text{Wednesday} = 5 \times \text{Monday} = 5 \times 114 = 570

4. **Total bananas picked in the first three days**: 
   We add the bananas picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:
   \[
   \text{Total for first 3 days} = \text{Monday} + \text{Tuesday} + \text{Wednesday} = 114 + 62 + 570

After accounting for 900 seats for the graduates, 300 seats for the faculty attending, and reserving 100 seats for the event's staff, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?",9.0,"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive to give to their friends and family, we first need to determine how many seats are available for guests after accounting for the seats reserved for graduates, faculty, and staff.

1. **Total seats in the Sports Arena**: 9400
2. **Seats reserved for graduates**: 900
3. **Seats reserved for faculty**: 300
4. **Seats reserved for staff**: 100

Now, we can calculate the total number of seats that are reserved:

\[
\text{Total reserved seats} = \text{Seats for graduates} + \text{Seats for faculty} + \text{Seats for staff}
\]
\[
\text{Total reserved seats} = 900 + 300 + 100 = 1300
\]

Next, we subtract the total reserved seats from the total seats in the arena to find the number of seats available for guests:

\[
\text{Available seats for guests} = \text{Total seats} - \text{Total reserved seats}
\]
\[
\text{Available seats for guests} = 9400 - 1300 = 8100
\]

Now, we need to determine how many graduates there are. Since the problem does not specify the number of graduates, we will denote the number of graduates as \( G \).

Each graduate will receive an equal number of tickets for their friends and family, which is calculated by dividing the available seats by the number of graduates:

\[
\text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{\text{Available seats for guests}}{G}
\]
\[
\text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{8100}{G}
\]

Thus, the number of tickets each graduate receives to give to their friends and family is \( \frac{8100}{G} \). 

To find the exact number of tickets per graduate, we would need to know the value of \( G \) (the number of graduates).",8100.0,0,"Let's think step by step.  
The Sports Arena has a total capacity of 9400 people.  
First, we need to account for the seats that are reserved:  
- 900 seats for the graduates  
- 300 seats for the faculty  
- 100 seats for the event's staff  

Now, let's calculate the total number of reserved seats:  
900 + 300 + 100 = 1300 reserved seats.  

Next, we subtract the reserved seats from the total capacity to find out how many seats are available for tickets:  
9400 - 1300 = 8100 available seats.  

Now, we need to determine how many graduates there are. Since the problem does not specify the number of graduates, we will assume that the number of graduates is equal to the number of reserved seats for them, which is 900.  

To find out how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we divide the available seats by the number of graduates:  
8100 / 900 = 9.

How many emails does Sophia respond to in a 5-day work week?",260.0,"To find out how many emails Sophia responds to in a 5-day work week, we can break the problem down into steps.

1. **Calculate the number of emails that require a response:**
   - Sophia receives 150 emails a day.
   - 16% of those emails don't require a response.
   - First, we calculate 16% of 150:
     \[
     0.16 \times 150 = 24
     \]
   - This means 24 emails do not require a response.
   - Now, we find the number of emails that do require a response:
     \[
     150 - 24 = 126
     \]

2. **Determine how many emails Sophia can respond to:**
   - Sophia can respond to 11 less than half of the emails that require a response.
   - First, we calculate half of the emails that require a response:

They agree to split it with Tara getting 190 yards more than Ananya, and Umar getting 30 yards more than Tara. How much is left over for Ananya?",150.0,"Let's denote the amount of fence Ananya gets as \( A \) yards. According to the problem, Tara gets 190 yards more than Ananya, so we can express Tara's amount as:

\[
T = A + 190
\]

Umar gets 30 yards more than Tara, so we can express Umar's amount as:

\[
U = T + 30 = (A + 190) + 30 = A + 220
\]

Now, we can set up an equation for the total amount of fence:

\[
A + T + U = 860
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( T \) and \( U \) into the equation gives us:

\[
A + (A + 190) + (A + 220) = 860
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
A + A + 190 + A + 220 = 860

This simplifies to:

\[
3A + 410 = 860
\]

Next, we will isolate \( A \) by subtracting 410 from both sides:

\[
3A = 860 - 410

\[
T = A + 190 = 150 + 190 = 340

\[
U = T + 30 = 340 + 30 = 370

Finally, we can check the total:

\[
A + T + U = 150 + 340 + 370 = 860

3. Umar gets 30 yards more than Tara, so Umar's amount can be represented as \( (A + 190) + 30 = A + 220 \).
4. Now, we can express the total amount of fence in terms of \( A \):
   \[
   A + (A + 190) + (A + 220) = 860

5. Simplifying this equation:
   \[
   A + A + 190 + A + 220 = 860

He then spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?",33.0,"To find out how many hours a week Santiago spends learning, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total class time per week:**
   - Santiago has 6 periods in a day, and he takes 3 extra classes. Therefore, he has a total of:
     \[
     6 + 3 = 9 \text{ classes per day}
     \]
   - Each class is 30 minutes long. So, the total class time per day is:
     \[
     9 \text{ classes} \times 30 \text{ minutes/class} = 270 \text{ minutes/day}
     \]
   - He goes to class for 4 days a week, so the total class time per week is:
     \[
     270 \text{ minutes/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 1080 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total review time per week:**
   - Santiago spends 15 minutes reviewing before each class. Since he has 9 classes per day, the review time per day is:
     \[
     9 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ minutes/class} = 135 \text{ minutes/day}
     \]
   - Over 4 days, the total review time per week is:

     1620 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - One-ninth of this is:
     \[
     \frac{1620 \text{ minutes}}{9} = 180 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Since he spends this amount on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:

Thus, Santiago spends a total of **33 hours a week** learning.",33.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of periods Santiago has in a day:**
   - He has 6 normal periods.
   - He takes 3 extra classes.
   - So, the total number of periods in a day is 6 + 3 = 9 periods.

2. **Calculate the total time spent in classes each day:**
   - Each class is 30 minutes long.
   - He has 3 extra classes, so the total time for extra classes is 3 * 30 = 90 minutes.
   - The total time spent in normal classes (6 periods) is 6 * 30 = 180 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in classes each day is 180 + 90 = 270 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time spent preparing for classes each day:**
   - He spends 15 minutes preparing before each of the 3 extra classes.
   - So, the total preparation time for extra classes is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.
   - He does not need to prepare for the normal classes, so the total preparation time is 45 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time spent learning each day:**
   - The total time spent learning each day is the time in classes plus the preparation time.
   - So, the total time spent learning each day is 270 + 45 = 315 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time spent learning in a week:**
   - He goes to class for 4 days a week.
   - So, the total time spent learning in a week is 315 * 4 = 1260 minutes.

6. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - First, we need to find out how many minutes are in a week: 7 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 10,080 minutes.
   - He spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.
   - One-ninth of 10,080 minutes is 10,080 / 9 = 1,120 minutes.
   - Since he spends this amount on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is 1,120 * 2 = 2,240 minutes.

7. **Calculate the total learning time for the week:**
   - The total learning time for the week is the time spent learning during the weekdays plus the extra learning time on the weekend.
   - So, the total learning time for the week is 1260 + 2,240 = 3,500 minutes.

8. **Convert the total learning time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we convert minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

   The supermarket will receive ₣220 after all the balls are sold.

Thus, the total amount the supermarket will have received after all the balls are sold is **₣220**.",220.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, we need to calculate the total number of each type of ball and their respective costs:
   - Blue balls: 9 balls at ₣12 each.
   - Purple balls: 11 balls at ₣9 each.
   - Pink balls: 17 balls at ₣4 each.

2. Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of ball:
   - Total cost for blue balls = 9 * 12 = ₣108.
   - Total cost for purple balls = 11 * 9 = ₣99.
   - Total cost for pink balls = 17 * 4 = ₣68.

3. Next, we add these amounts to find the total revenue before the discount:
   - Total revenue = ₣108 + ₣99 + ₣68 = ₣275.

4. The supermarket has a promotion that gives a 20% discount on all purchases. We need to calculate the discount amount:
   - Discount = 20% of ₣275 = 0.20 * 275 = ₣55.

5. Finally, we subtract the discount from the total revenue to find out how much the supermarket will receive after all the balls are sold:
   - Amount received after discount = ₣275 - ₣55 = ₣220.

The answer is ₣220.",220.0,1,,220.0,1

On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?",75.0,"Let \( v \) be Olivia's original speed on the beach in kilometers per hour. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is \( 4v \).

Since Olivia's speed has decreased by half due to her injury, her new speed on the beach is \( \frac{v}{2} \) and her new speed on the sidewalk is \( \frac{4v}{2} = 2v \).

We know that Olivia spends 60 minutes (or 1 hour) walking on the beach. The distance she walks on the beach is 10 kilometers. We can use the formula for time, which is:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

For the beach, we have:

\[
1 \text{ hour} = \frac{10 \text{ km}}{\frac{v}{2}}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
1 = \frac{10 \cdot 2}{v}
\]

Thus, we can solve for \( v \):

\[
v = 20 \text{ km/h}
\]

Now, we can find Olivia's new speeds:

- Beach speed: \( \frac{v}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ km/h} \)
- Sidewalk speed: \( 2v = 2 \cdot 20 = 40 \text{ km/h} \)

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for Olivia to walk the 10 kilometers on the sidewalk. Using the time formula again:

\[
\text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{10 \text{ km}}{40 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we can find the total time for her entire 20-kilometer walk:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 60 \text{ minutes} + 15 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it takes for Olivia to complete her entire 20-kilometer walk is:

\[
\boxed{75} \text{ minutes}

1. Olivia walks a total of 20 kilometers every day, which includes 10 kilometers on the beach and 10 kilometers on the sidewalk.

2. We know that Olivia's speed on the sidewalk is four times her speed on the beach. Let's denote her original speed on the beach as \( v \). Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is \( 4v \).

3. Due to her injury, her speed has decreased by half. So, her new speed on the beach is \( \frac{v}{2} \) and her new speed on the sidewalk is \( \frac{4v}{2} = 2v \).

4. We are told that Olivia spends 60 minutes walking on the beach. To find out how long it takes her to walk the 10 kilometers on the beach, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   Since she walks 10 kilometers on the beach at a speed of \( \frac{v}{2} \):
   \[
   60 = \frac{10}{\frac{v}{2}}
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   60 = \frac{20}{v}
   \]
   Thus, we can find \( v \):
   \[
   v = \frac{20}{60} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ km/min}
   \]

5. Now, we can calculate her speed on the sidewalk:
   \[
   \text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ km/min}
   \]

6. Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk the 10 kilometers on the sidewalk:
   \[
   \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{10}{\frac{2}{3}} = 10 \times \frac{3}{2} = 15 \text{ minutes}
   \]

7. Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the entire 20-kilometer walk:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 60 \text{ minutes (beach)} + 15 \text{ minutes (sidewalk)} = 75 \text{ minutes}

1. **Calculate the number of apartments in each complex:**
   - The first two complexes each have 300 apartments.
   - The total number of apartments in the first two complexes is:
     \[
     300 + 300 = 600 \text{ apartments}

   - The last complex is 50% bigger than the first two combined. Therefore, the number of apartments in the last complex is:
     \[
     600 \times 1.5 = 900 \text{ apartments}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of apartments:**
   - The total number of apartments across all three complexes is:

3. **Calculate the number of collections per week:**
   - Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each complex. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:
     \[
     2 \text{ collections/week} \times 3 \text{ complexes} = 6 \text{ collections/week}
     \]

4. **Calculate the earnings from collections:**
   - Oliver earns ¥0.45 per collection for each apartment. Therefore, his earnings from collections per week is:
     \[
     1500 \text{ apartments} \times 6 \text{ collections/week} \times ¥0.45 = 1500 \times 6 \times 0.45

     \[
     10 \text{ minutes} \times ¥0.7/\text{minute} = ¥7.0

2. **Next 24 minutes (from minute 11 to minute 34)**: 
   - Cost per minute: ¥0.5
   - Total cost for 24 minutes: 
     \[
     24 \text{ minutes} \times ¥0.5/\text{minute} = ¥12.0
     \]

3. **Remaining 60 minutes (from minute 35 to minute 94)**: 
   - Cost per two minutes: ¥0.1
   - Since we need to calculate the cost for 60 minutes, we first find out how many two-minute intervals are in 60 minutes:

However, due to a recent injury, the maintenance worker has become slower and it will take them twice as long to clean a floor these days. If they work for 6 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?",60.0,"To determine the percentage of the maintenance worker's day spent cleaning floors, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to clean all floors:**
   - Originally, it takes 6 minutes per floor.
   - Due to the injury, it now takes twice as long, which is \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) minutes per floor.
   - The total number of floors is 180.
   - Therefore, the total time to clean all floors is:
     \[
     180 \text{ floors} \times 12 \text{ minutes/floor} = 2160 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Convert the total cleaning time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
     \[
     \frac{2160 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 36 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total working hours over 10 days:**
   - The maintenance worker works for 6 hours a day for 10 days:
     \[
     6 \text{ hours/day} \times 10 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning:**
   - The percentage of time spent cleaning is given by the ratio of the total cleaning hours to the total working hours, multiplied by 100:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{36 \text{ hours}}{60 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Calculating this gives:

   \[
   6 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 12 \text{ minutes per floor}

3. To find the total time needed to clean all 180 floors, we multiply the number of floors by the time per floor:
   \[
   180 \text{ floors} \times 12 \text{ minutes per floor} = 2160 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. The maintenance worker has 10 days to complete the cleaning. To find out how many minutes they can work each day, we first convert the 6 hours they work each day into minutes:
   \[
   6 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 360 \text{ minutes per day}

5. Over 10 days, the total time they can work is:
   \[
   10 \text{ days} \times 360 \text{ minutes per day} = 3600 \text{ minutes}
