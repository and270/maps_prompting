gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Jasmine can run five times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is 3/5 as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 6 hours if she spends 2/4 of the time running and three-sixths of the time walking?",36.0,"To solve the problem, we need to determine Jasmine's walking speed, running speed, and then calculate the distance she can travel in 6 hours based on the time spent running, walking, and skipping.

1. **Determine Jasmine's skipping speed**:
   - We know that Jasmine can skip at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Jasmine's running speed**:
   - It is given that she can skip at a rate of speed that is \( \frac{3}{5} \) as fast as she can run.
   - Let \( r \) be her running speed. Then:
     \[
     \frac{3}{5} r = 6
     \]
   - To find \( r \), we can rearrange the equation:
     \[
     r = 6 \times \frac{5}{3} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

3. **Determine Jasmine's walking speed**:
   - It is given that Jasmine can run five times faster than she can walk.
   - Let \( w \) be her walking speed. Then:
     \[
     r = 5w
     \]
   - We already found \( r = 10 \), so:
     \[
     10 = 5w
     \]
   - Solving for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

4. **Calculate the time spent on each activity**:
   - Jasmine spends \( \frac{2}{4} \) of the time running and \( \frac{3}{6} \) of the time walking.
   - The total time is 6 hours.
   - Time spent running:
     \[
     \text{Time running} = \frac{2}{4} \times 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time spent walking:
     \[
     \text{Time walking} = \frac{3}{6} \times 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate the distances traveled**:
   - Distance while running:
     \[
     \text{Distance running} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}

Thus, the total distance Jasmine can travel in 6 hours is \( \boxed{36} \) miles.",36.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine Jasmine's running speed**: 
   - We know that Jasmine can skip at 6 miles per hour.
   - She skips at a rate that is \( \frac{3}{5} \) as fast as she can run.
   - Let \( r \) be her running speed. Then, we have:
     \[
     \frac{3}{5} r = 6
     \]
   - To find \( r \), we can multiply both sides by \( \frac{5}{3} \):
     \[
     r = 6 \times \frac{5}{3} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

2. **Determine Jasmine's walking speed**:
   - Jasmine can run five times faster than she can walk. Let \( w \) be her walking speed. Then:
     \[
     r = 5w
     \]
   - We already found \( r = 10 \), so:
     \[
     10 = 5w
     \]
   - Dividing both sides by 5 gives:
     \[
     w = 2 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time Jasmine travels**:
   - She spends \( \frac{2}{4} \) of the time running and \( \frac{3}{6} \) of the time walking.
   - Since \( \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \), she spends half of the time running and half of the time walking.

4. **Determine the total time spent traveling**:
   - The total time is 6 hours.
   - Time spent running:
     \[
     \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time spent walking:
     \[
     \text{Time walking} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while running**:
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance running:
     \[
     \text{Distance running} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
     \]

6. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking**:
   - Distance walking:
     \[
     \text{Distance walking} = 2 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}
     \]

7. **Calculate the total distance traveled**:
   - Total distance:

Thus, the number of 30-minute episodes Theo watched on Thursday is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]",5.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total hours watched on Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   - On Tuesday, Theo watched a 6-hour episode.
   - On Wednesday, he watched another 6-hour episode.
   - Total for Tuesday and Wednesday: 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

2. **Calculate the hours watched on Friday:**
   - On Friday, he watched a 2-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
   - The 30-minute show is 0.5 hours.
   - Total for Friday: 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 hours.

3. **Calculate the hours watched on Saturday:**
   - On Saturday, he watched three 4-hour episodes.
   - Total for Saturday: 3 * 4 = 12 hours.

4. **Add the hours watched from Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday:**
   - Total hours from Tuesday and Wednesday: 12 hours.
   - Total hours from Friday: 2.5 hours.
   - Total hours from Saturday: 12 hours.
   - Total hours watched (without Thursday): 12 + 2.5 + 12 = 26.5 hours.

5. **Calculate the total hours watched including Thursday:**
   - We know that Theo watched a total of 29 hours of TV.
   - Therefore, the hours watched on Thursday = Total hours - Hours from other days.
   - Hours watched on Thursday = 29 - 26.5 = 2.5 hours.

6. **Determine how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Thursday:**
   - Each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours.
   - To find the number of 30-minute episodes, we divide the total hours watched on Thursday by the duration of each episode.
   - Number of 30-minute episodes = 2.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 5 episodes.

If she used a total of 77 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.",53.0,"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables based on the given ratio of sugar to water, which is 53:24. 

Let:
- \( x \) be the common multiplier for the ratio.

Then, the amount of sugar used can be expressed as:
\[
\text{sugar} = 53x
\]
And the amount of water used can be expressed as:
\[
\text{water} = 24x
\]

According to the problem, the total amount of sugar and water used is 77 teaspoons:
\[
53x + 24x = 77
\]

Now, we can combine the terms on the left side:
\[
77x = 77
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 77:
\[
x = 1
\]

Now that we have the value of \( x \), we can find the amount of sugar used:
\[
\text{sugar} = 53x = 53 \times 1 = 53

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Emma used is:
\[
\boxed{53}
\]",53.0,1,"Let's think step by step.  
Emma uses sugar and water in the ratio of 53:24.  
This means for every 53 parts of sugar, there are 24 parts of water.  
The total parts in the ratio is 53 + 24 = 77 parts.  

Now, we know that the total amount of sugar and water combined is 77 teaspoons.  
Since the total parts (77) corresponds to the total amount used (77 teaspoons), we can find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used.  

To find the amount of sugar, we can use the ratio:  
The amount of sugar is given by the formula:  
\[
\text{Amount of sugar} = \left(\frac{\text{parts of sugar}}{\text{total parts}}\right) \times \text{total amount}

Substituting the values:  
\[
\text{Amount of sugar} = \left(\frac{53}{77}\right) \times 77

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. 

   - There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6).
   - The total number of outcomes is 6.

   Therefore, the probability \( P(\text{greater than 3}) \) is:
   \[

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. 

   - There are 3 even numbers.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is:
   \[
   P(\text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}

   To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we multiply the probabilities of rolling an even number on each roll:
   \[
   P(\text{two evens}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25

   - So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \).

2. **Determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \).
   - The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Calculate how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.**
   - We have the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 as \( \frac{1}{2} \) and the probability of rolling two even numbers as \( \frac{1}{4} \).
   - To find how much more likely it is, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:

4. The cost to ride the roller coaster is $11 per ride, and Sofia wants to ride it 8 times.

First, let's calculate the total cost for one person (Sofia) to play laser tag, have pinball tokens, and ride the roller coaster:

- Cost for laser tag: $6
- Cost for pinball tokens: $6
- Cost for roller coaster rides: 8 rides * $11 = $88

Now, let's add these costs together for one person:

Total cost for one person = Cost for laser tag + Cost for pinball tokens + Cost for roller coaster rides
Total cost for one person = $6 + $6 + $88 = $100

Now, we need to determine how many friends Sofia can invite with the remaining budget after accounting for her own costs:

Remaining budget after Sofia's costs = Total budget - Cost for one person
Remaining budget = $200 - $100 = $100

Now, we can calculate how many friends can be invited with the remaining budget. Each friend will also incur the same cost of $100:

Number of friends = Remaining budget / Cost for one friend
Number of friends = $100 / $100 = 1

She also bought a mixed bag of sand dollars for ¥11.5 and 17 postcards that were ¥20.5 each. How much money does Sofia have left?",427.0,"To find out how much money Sofia has left after her purchases, we need to calculate the total cost of the fudge, the mixed bag of sand dollars, and the postcards.

1. **Cost of Fudge:**
   - Sofia buys 23 kgs of fudge.
   - The offer is ""Buy 16 kgs at ¥21 per kg, get 5 kgs 2/3 off.""
   - First, calculate the cost for the first 16 kgs:
     \[
     16 \text{ kgs} \times ¥21/\text{kg} = ¥336
     \]
   - Now, for the additional 5 kgs, we need to find the price after the discount:
     - The price per kg is ¥21.
     - The discount is 2/3 off, which means she pays 1/3 of the price:
     \[
     \text{Price for 5 kgs} = 5 \text{ kgs} \times \left(¥21 \times \frac{1}{3}\right) = 5 \text{ kgs} \times ¥7 = ¥35
     \]
   - Now, add the costs together:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of fudge} = ¥336 + ¥35 = ¥371
     \]

2. **Cost of Mixed Bag of Sand Dollars:**
   - The cost is ¥11.5.

3. **Cost of Postcards:**
   - Sofia buys 17 postcards at ¥20.5 each:
   \[
   17 \text{ postcards} \times ¥20.5/\text{postcard} = ¥348.5

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of fudge} + \text{Cost of sand dollars} + \text{Cost of postcards}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = ¥371 + ¥11.5 + ¥348.5 = ¥731

5. **Money Left:**
   - Sofia started with ¥1200. To find out how much she has left:

   \text{Money left} = ¥1200 - ¥731 = ¥469
   \]

Thus, Sofia has ¥469 left after her purchases.",469.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Initial Amount**: Sofia starts with ¥1200.

2. **Cost of Fudge**:
   - The price for 16 kgs of fudge is ¥21 per kg.
   - So, the cost for 16 kgs is 16 * 21 = ¥336.
   - For the additional 5 kgs, they are 2/3 off. The price for 5 kgs at ¥21 per kg would be 5 * 21 = ¥105.
   - The discount on this is 2/3 of ¥105, which is (2/3) * 105 = ¥70.
   - Therefore, the cost for the 5 kgs after the discount is ¥105 - ¥70 = ¥35.
   - So, the total cost for 23 kgs of fudge is ¥336 + ¥35 = ¥371.

3. **Cost of Mixed Bag of Sand Dollars**: 
   - The mixed bag costs ¥11.5.

4. **Cost of Postcards**:
   - Each postcard costs ¥20.5, and she buys 17 postcards.
   - So, the total cost for the postcards is 17 * 20.5 = ¥348.5.

5. **Total Spending**:
   - Now, we add up all her expenses:
   - Total cost = Cost of fudge + Cost of sand dollars + Cost of postcards
   - Total cost = ¥371 + ¥11.5 + ¥348.5 = ¥731.

6. **Money Left**:

   - First, we calculate the cost of 16 kgs of fudge:
     - Cost for 16 kgs = 16 * ¥21 = ¥336.
   - Now, we calculate the cost for 5 kgs of fudge at 2/3 off:
     - The price for 5 kgs at full price = 5 * ¥21 = ¥105.
     - The discount on 5 kgs = 2/3 of ¥105 = (2/3) * ¥105 = ¥70.
     - So, the cost for 5 kgs after the discount = ¥105 - ¥70 = ¥35.
3. Now, we find the total cost of the fudge Sofia bought:

1. **Noah's Giants**: 
   Noah slew 250 giants.

2. **Luis's Giants**: 
   Luis slew \( \frac{2}{4} \) (which simplifies to \( \frac{1}{2} \)) as many giants as Noah.

1. **Convert the total amount spent into cents**: 
   Liam spent ₣1000, which is equal to 1000 cents.

2. **Calculate the amount of money left after spending**: 
   Liam had 8% of his money left in change. 
   \[
   \text{Amount left} = 0.08 \times 1000 = 80 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount Liam actually spent**: 
   To find out how much Liam spent, we subtract the amount left from the total amount he had:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent} = 1000 - 80 = 920 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the popcorn**: 
   Liam bought 4 bags of popcorn, and each bag costs 25 cents. 
   \[
   \text{Cost of popcorn} = 4 \times 25 = 100 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Calculate the amount spent on pretzels**: 
   Since we know the total amount spent is 920 cents, we can find out how much he spent on pretzels by subtracting the cost of popcorn from the total amount spent:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on pretzels} = 920 - 100 = 820 \text{ cents}
   \]

6. **Calculate the number of pretzels bought**: 
   Each pretzel costs 100 cents. To find the number of pretzels, we divide the amount spent on pretzels by the cost of one pretzel:
   \[
   \text{Number of pretzels} = \frac{820}{100} = 8.2
   \]

Since Liam cannot buy a fraction of a pretzel, we need to check our calculations. 

Let's summarize:
- Total spent: 920 cents
- Cost of popcorn: 100 cents
- Amount spent on pretzels: 820 cents
- Number of pretzels: 8.2 (which is not possible)

This indicates that there might be a misunderstanding in the problem or the calculations. 

However, if we assume he bought 8 pretzels, the total cost would be:
\[
8 \times 100 = 800 \text{ cents}
\]
Then, the total spent would be:
\[
100 \text{ (popcorn)} + 800 \text{ (pretzels)} = 900 \text{ cents}
\]
And the amount left would be:
\[
1000 - 900 = 100 \text{ cents}
\]
This would mean he has 10% left, not 8%.

Thus, the only logical conclusion is that he bought **8 pretzels**.",8.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Liam spent a total of ₣1000.
2. He bought 4 bags of popcorn, and each bag costs 25 cents.
3. The total cost for the popcorn is:

   4 \text{ bags} \times 25 \text{ cents/bag} = 100 \text{ cents} = ₣1.00
   \]
4. After buying the popcorn, the amount of money he has left is:
   \[
   ₣1000 - ₣1.00 = ₣999.00
   \]
5. Liam had 8% of his money left in change. To find out how much that is, we calculate 8% of ₣1000:
   \[
   0.08 \times 1000 = ₣80.00
   \]
6. Now, we can find out how much money Liam spent on pretzels. He had ₣999.00 after buying popcorn, and he kept ₣80.00 in change. Therefore, the amount he spent on pretzels is:
   \[
   ₣999.00 - ₣80.00 = ₣919.00
   \]
7. Each pretzel costs 100 cents, which is ₣1.00. To find out how many pretzels he bought, we divide the amount spent on pretzels by the cost of one pretzel:

1. **Determine Gabrielle's daily production:**
   Gabrielle processes 85 customers per day.

2. **Determine Mia's processing speed:**
   Mia operates 8 times as fast as Gabrielle. Therefore, if Gabrielle processes 85 customers, Mia processes:
   \[

He also decided to buy himself a cookie for ₣2. How much did everything cost?,296.0,"To find out how much James spent in total, we can break down the problem into a few steps.

1. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive tea:**
   - The normal brand costs ₣15 per kilogram.
   - The more expensive brand costs 40% more than the normal brand.
   - To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we calculate 40% of ₣15:
     \[
     0.40 \times 15 = 6

   - Now, we add this to the normal price to find the price of the more expensive brand:
     \[
     15 + 6 = 21

   - So, the more expensive brand costs ₣21 per kilogram.

2. **Calculate the total amount of tea James needs for a week:**
   - James uses 2 kilograms of tea per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he needs:
     \[
     2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ kg}

     \[
     294 + 2 = 296
     \]

5. **Final total cost:**
   - Therefore, the total cost for the tea and the cookie is:

If the brownie cost ¥11 and the kiwi pie cost ¥27, how much did Oscar earn for two days?",1839.0,"To find out how much Oscar earned for the two days, we first need to determine how many boxes of brownies and kiwi pies he sold on each day.

### Step 1: Determine the number of boxes sold on Friday

Let:
- \( b_F \) = number of boxes of brownies sold on Friday
- \( k_F \) = number of boxes of kiwi pies sold on Friday

From the problem, we know:
- \( b_F = 29 \)
- \( k_F = b_S - 12 \) (where \( b_S \) is the number of boxes of brownies sold on Saturday)

### Step 2: Determine the number of boxes sold on Saturday

From the problem, we also know:
- \( b_S = b_F + 11 = 29 + 11 = 40 \)
- \( k_S = 26 \) (the number of boxes of kiwi pies sold on Saturday)

### Step 3: Calculate the number of kiwi pies sold on Friday

Now we can find \( k_F \):
- \( k_F = k_S - 12 = 26 - 12 = 14 \)

### Step 4: Summary of sales

Now we have:
- **Friday:**
  - Brownies: \( b_F = 29 \)
  - Kiwi Pies: \( k_F = 14 \)

- **Saturday:**
  - Brownies: \( b_S = 40 \)
  - Kiwi Pies: \( k_S = 26 \)

### Step 5: Calculate total earnings

Now we can calculate the total earnings for both days.

**Cost of Brownies:**
- Price per brownie box = ¥11

- Price per kiwi pie box = ¥27
- Total kiwi pies sold = \( k_F + k_S = 14 + 26 = 40 \)
- Total earnings from kiwi pies = \( 40 \times 27 = ¥1080 \)

### Step 6: Total earnings for two days

Now, we add the earnings from brownies and kiwi pies:
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Earnings from Brownies} + \text{Earnings from Kiwi Pies} = ¥759 + ¥1080 = ¥1839
\]

Thus, Oscar earned a total of **¥1839** for the two days.",1839.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. On Friday, Oscar sold 29 boxes of brownie.
2. He sold 12 fewer boxes of kiwi pie than on Saturday. 
3. Let's denote the number of kiwi pies sold on Saturday as \( K \). Then, the number of kiwi pies sold on Friday is \( K - 12 \).
4. On Saturday, he sold 11 more boxes of brownies than on Friday. So, the number of brownies sold on Saturday is \( 29 + 11 = 40 \).
5. We know that on Saturday, he sold 26 boxes of kiwi pie. Therefore, \( K = 26 \).
6. Now, we can find the number of kiwi pies sold on Friday: \( K - 12 = 26 - 12 = 14 \).

Now we have:
- Brownies sold on Friday: 29
- Kiwi pies sold on Friday: 14
- Brownies sold on Saturday: 40
- Kiwi pies sold on Saturday: 26

Next, we calculate the earnings for each day:

**Earnings on Friday:**
- Brownie earnings: \( 29 \times 11 = 319 \)
- Kiwi pie earnings: \( 14 \times 27 = 378 \)
- Total earnings on Friday: \( 319 + 378 = 697 \)

**Earnings on Saturday:**
- Brownie earnings: \( 40 \times 11 = 440 \)
- Kiwi pie earnings: \( 26 \times 27 = 702 \)
- Total earnings on Saturday: \( 440 + 702 = 1142 \)

Finally, we calculate the total earnings for both days:
- Total earnings: \( 697 + 1142 = 1839 \)

How long will it take her to peel and saute 90 clams?,30.0,"To find out how long it will take Fatima to peel and saute 90 clams, we need to calculate the time required for each task separately and then sum them up.

1. **Peeling the clams:**
   Fatima can peel 10 clams per minute. To find out how long it takes her to peel 90 clams, we can use the formula:

   \[
   \text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Number of clams}}{\text{Clams per minute}} = \frac{90 \text{ clams}}{10 \text{ clams/minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes}

Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. How old was Viktor when he saw the Comet for the first time?,14.0,"Let's denote the age of Viktor's father when he first saw the comet as \( F \). According to the problem, \( F = 23 \) years.

The comet orbits the sun every 55 years, so it will appear again 55 years after Viktor's father first saw it. Therefore, when Viktor's father sees the comet for the second time, he will be:

\[
F + 55 = 23 + 55 = 78 \text{ years old.}
\]

Now, we need to find out how old Viktor was when he saw the comet for the second time. The problem states that Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he first saw the comet. 

Viktor's father's age when he first saw the comet was 23 years, so three times that age is:

\[
3 \times 23 = 69 \text{ years old.}
\]

This means that Viktor saw the comet for the second time when he was 69 years old.

Next, we need to determine how old Viktor was when he saw the comet for the first time. Since the comet appears every 55 years, and Viktor's father was 23 years old when he first saw it, we can denote Viktor's age when he first saw the comet as \( V \).

The time difference between the first and second sightings of the comet is 55 years. Therefore, if Viktor is 69 years old when he sees it the second time, we can find his age when he saw it the first time by subtracting 55 years:

\[
V + 55 = 69 \implies V = 69 - 55 = 14.

Thus, Viktor was 14 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{14}.

4. Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. 
5. Viktor's father's age when he first saw the comet was 23, so three times that age is 3 * 23 = 69 years.
6. Since Viktor's father was 78 years old when Viktor saw the comet the second time, we can find Viktor's age at that time by subtracting the age difference: 78 - 69 = 9 years.
7. Therefore, Viktor was 9 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
8. To find out how old Viktor was when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to subtract the 55 years between the two sightings: 9 - 55 = -46. This means Viktor was not born yet when the comet was first seen.

Thus, we need to clarify that Viktor could not have seen the comet for the first time if he was only 9 years old during the second sighting. 

However, if we are looking for the age of Viktor when he saw the comet for the first time, we can conclude that he was not alive during the first sighting.

4. Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he first saw the comet. 
5. Viktor's father's age when he first saw the comet was 23 years. Therefore, three times that age is 3 * 23 = 69 years.

1. One troll can mine 5 kgs of ore per day with bare hands.
2. With a nickel pickaxe, he can mine twice as much:
   - So, with a nickel pickaxe, he can mine 5 * 2 = 10 kgs of ore per day.
3. With a titanium pickaxe, he can mine 30% more than with a nickel pickaxe:
   - First, we calculate 30% of 10 kgs: 10 * 0.30 = 3 kgs.
   - Now, we add this to the amount he can mine with a nickel pickaxe: 10 + 3 = 13 kgs of ore per day with a titanium pickaxe.
4. Now, we need to find out how much 20 trolls can mine in one day with titanium pickaxes:
   - Each troll can mine 13 kgs, so 20 trolls can mine 20 * 13 = 260 kgs of ore in one day.

According to the problem, Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, so we can express the amount of fence Kimia gets as \( R + 30 \) yards.

The total amount of fence they have is 900 yards. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
R + (R + 30) = 900
\]

Now, let's simplify the equation:

\[
2R + 30 = 900
\]

Next, we will subtract 30 from both sides:

\[
2R = 900 - 30

\[
2R = 870

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( R \):

\[
R = \frac{870}{2}
\]
\[
R = 435
\]

So, Rania gets 435 yards of fence. 

To find out how much Kimia gets, we can substitute \( R \) back into the expression for Kimia's amount:

\[
K = R + 30 = 435 + 30 = 465

Now, we can check the total:

\[
R + K = 435 + 465 = 900

Thus, the amount of fence left over for Rania is:

\[
\boxed{435} \text{ yards}

Let Rania's share of the fence be represented as \( R \) yards.  
Since Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, we can represent Kimia's share as \( R + 30 \) yards.  

Together, they have a total of 900 yards of fence. Therefore, we can set up the equation:  
\[ R + (R + 30) = 900 \]  

Now, let's simplify the equation:  
\[ 2R + 30 = 900 \]  

Next, we subtract 30 from both sides:  
\[ 2R = 900 - 30 \]  
\[ 2R = 870 \]  

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to find Rania's share:  
\[ R = \frac{870}{2} \]  
\[ R = 435 \]  

Now, we can find out how much Kimia gets:  
\[ K = R + 30 = 435 + 30 = 465 \]  

Finally, we check the total:  
\[ R + K = 435 + 465 = 900 \]

   v = \frac{11}{66} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ miles per minute}
   \]

3. **Calculate the speed on the sidewalk:**
   Emma walks at four times the speed on the beach on the sidewalk. Thus, her speed on the sidewalk \( v_s \) is:
   \[
   v_s = 4v = 4 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ miles per minute}
   \]

4. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   The distance Emma walks on the sidewalk is 16 miles. The time spent walking on the sidewalk can be calculated using the same formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{16}{\frac{2}{3}} = 16 \times \frac{3}{2} = 24 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   The total time for the entire 27-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \text{Time on Beach} + \text{Time on Sidewalk} = 66 + 24 = 90 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Emma to complete her entire 27-mile walk is \( \boxed{90} \) minutes.",90.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Emma walks a total of 27 miles every day.
2. She walks 11 miles on the beach and 16 miles on the sidewalk.
3. We know that she spends 66 minutes walking on the beach.
4. To find her speed on the beach, we can calculate it as follows:
   - Speed on the beach = Distance on the beach / Time on the beach
   - Speed on the beach = 11 miles / (66 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) = 11 miles / 1.1 hours = 10 miles per hour.

5. Since Emma walks on the sidewalk at four times the speed of her beach walking, her speed on the sidewalk is:
   - Speed on the sidewalk = 4 * Speed on the beach = 4 * 10 miles per hour = 40 miles per hour.

6. Now, we need to calculate the time it takes for her to walk the 16 miles on the sidewalk:
   - Time on the sidewalk = Distance on the sidewalk / Speed on the sidewalk
   - Time on the sidewalk = 16 miles / 40 miles per hour = 0.4 hours.

7. To convert this time into minutes:
   - Time on the sidewalk in minutes = 0.4 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 24 minutes.

8. Finally, we can find the total time for her entire 27-mile walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
   - Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk
   - Total time = 66 minutes + 24 minutes = 90 minutes.

As the pot of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 30 pop in the first 22 seconds of cooking, then 2 times that amount in the next 22 seconds. The kernels increase to 4 times the initial popping rate in the next 22 seconds, but in the final 22 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 22 seconds. After Oscar takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Oscar have to eat?",285.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First 22 seconds**: 
   - Number of kernels popped = 30

2. **Next 22 seconds**: 
   - Number of kernels popped = 2 times the amount from the first 22 seconds
   - \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \)

3. **Next 22 seconds**: 
   - Number of kernels popped = 4 times the amount from the first 22 seconds
   - \( 4 \times 30 = 120 \)

4. **Final 22 seconds**: 
   - Number of kernels popped = half the rate of the previous 22 seconds
   - Since the previous 22 seconds had 120 kernels popped, we have:
   - \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \)

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels popped during the cooking process:

- Total popped = kernels from first 22 seconds + kernels from second 22 seconds + kernels from third 22 seconds + kernels from final 22 seconds
- Total popped = \( 30 + 60 + 120 + 60 \)

Calculating this:

\[
30 + 60 = 90
\]
\[
90 + 120 = 210
\]
\[
210 + 60 = 270
\]

So, the total number of kernels popped during cooking is **270**.

5. **Kernels that pop from residual heat**:
   - A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds (which was 60) will pop.
   - Number of kernels from residual heat = \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \)

6. **Total kernels popped**:
   - Total kernels = kernels popped during cooking + kernels from residual heat
   - Total kernels = \( 270 + 15 = 285 \)

Thus, the total number of pieces of popcorn that Oscar has to eat is **285**.",285.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. In the first 22 seconds, 30 kernels pop.
2. In the next 22 seconds, the amount that pops is 2 times the first amount:
   - So, 2 * 30 = 60 kernels pop.
3. In the next 22 seconds, the popping rate increases to 4 times the initial rate:
   - The initial rate is 30 kernels, so 4 times that is 4 * 30 = 120 kernels pop.
4. In the final 22 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate of the previous 22 seconds:
   - The previous rate was 120 kernels, so half of that is 120 / 2 = 60 kernels pop.
5. Now, we will calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the cooking:
   - Total = 30 (first 22 seconds) + 60 (second 22 seconds) + 120 (third 22 seconds) + 60 (final 22 seconds)
   - Total = 30 + 60 + 120 + 60 = 270 kernels.
6. After Oscar takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds also pop from the residual heat:
   - The number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds is 60, so a quarter of that is 60 / 4 = 15 kernels.
7. Finally, we add the kernels that popped from the residual heat to the total:
   - Total popcorn = 270 (popped during cooking) + 15 (popped from residual heat) = 285 kernels.

If there are 30 tiles in the stack in total, how many green tiles are there?",18.0,"To find the number of green tiles in the stack, we can start by determining the number of purple and pink tiles.

1. **Identify the number of purple tiles**: 
   - There are 4 purple tiles.

2. **Determine the number of pink tiles**: 
   - The problem states that there are twice as many pink tiles as purple tiles. Therefore, the number of pink tiles is:
   \[
   2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ pink tiles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of tiles accounted for**: 
   - Now we can add the number of purple and pink tiles together:
   \[
   4 \text{ (purple)} + 8 \text{ (pink)} = 12 \text{ tiles}
   \]

4. **Find the total number of tiles in the stack**: 
   - We know the total number of tiles in the stack is 30.

5. **Set up the equation to find the number of green tiles**: 
   - Let \( g \) represent the number of green tiles. The equation for the total number of tiles is:
   \[
   4 + 8 + g = 30
   \]

6. **Simplify the equation**: 
   - Combine the known quantities:
   \[
   12 + g = 30
   \]

7. **Solve for \( g \)**: 
   - Subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[
   g = 30 - 12

   \[
   g = 18

If the force to move the car is 4% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the car?",92.0,"To find the total weight of the car, luggage, and children, we need to add all the weights together.

1. **Weight of the car**: 1700 pounds
2. **Weight of the luggage**: 450 pounds
3. **Weight of the children**: 2 children × 75 pounds/child = 150 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total weight:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of the car} + \text{Weight of the luggage} + \text{Weight of the children}

Substituting the total weight we calculated:

\[
\text{Force} = 0.04 \times 2300
