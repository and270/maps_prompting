She bought 6 dozen croissants which cost $19 per dozen, 4 dozen macarons which cost $77 per dozen, and 3 dozen brownies for $118 per dozen. How much was the total cost if she received 25% discount on all purchases?",582.0,"To find the total cost of Beatriz's purchases, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of baked good and then add them together. We also need to apply the 25% discount.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the croissants
6 dozen croissants x $19 per dozen = 6 x $19 = $114

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the macarons
4 dozen macarons x $77 per dozen = 4 x $77 = $308

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the brownies
3 dozen brownies x $118 per dozen = 3 x $118 = $354

Step 4: Add the total cost of all the baked goods together
$114 + $308 + $354 = $776

Step 5: Apply the 25% discount
To find the discount amount, multiply the total cost by 0.25 (25%):
$776 x 0.25 = $194
Now subtract the discount from the total cost:
$776 - $194 = $582

So the total cost of Beatriz's purchases after the 25% discount is $582.",582.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Beatriz bought 6 dozen croissants at $19 per dozen.
So, the cost of croissants is 6 * $19 = $114.

She bought 4 dozen macarons at $77 per dozen.
So, the cost of macarons is 4 * $77 = $308.

She bought 3 dozen brownies at $118 per dozen.
So, the cost of brownies is 3 * $118 = $354.

The total cost before discount is $114 + $308 + $354 = $776.

Beatriz received a 25% discount on all purchases.
To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $776 which is 0.25 * $776 = $194.

So, the total cost after discount is $776 - $194 = $582.

The answer is $582.",582.0,1,,582.0,1

But as I pour it, I spill 7 liters of the mango drink. To make up for that, I add 7 liters of water to the mix. What percentage of the final mix is water?",50.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the mango drink**

You have 16 liters of mango drink that is one-ninth water. To find the amount of water, multiply the total amount by the fraction of water:

16 liters x (1/9) = 16/9 liters = 1.78 liters (approximately)

So, the mango drink contains approximately 1.78 liters of water.

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the apple drink**

You have 14 liters of apple drink that is one-half water. To find the amount of water, multiply the total amount by the fraction of water:

14 liters x (1/2) = 14/2 liters = 7 liters

So, the apple drink contains 7 liters of water.

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water after pouring the mango drink**

You spill 7 liters of the mango drink, so you're left with:

16 liters - 7 liters = 9 liters of mango drink

The amount of water in the remaining mango drink is:

9 liters x (1/9) = 9/9 liters = 1 liter

Now, add the water from the mango drink to the water from the apple drink:

1 liter (mango) + 7 liters (apple) = 8 liters of water

**Step 4: Add the 7 liters of water to make up for the spill**

You add 7 liters of water to the mix, so the total amount of water becomes:

8 liters + 7 liters = 15 liters of water

**Step 5: Calculate the total volume of the final mix**

You have 9 liters of mango drink left, 14 liters of apple drink, and 7 liters of water added:

9 liters + 14 liters + 7 liters = 30 liters

**Step 6: Calculate the percentage of water in the final mix**

To find the percentage of water, divide the total amount of water by the total volume of the mix, and multiply by 100:

(15 liters / 30 liters) x 100% ≈ 50%

So, the final mix is approximately 50% water.",50.0,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. You start with 16 liters of mango drink, which is one-ninth water.
To find the amount of water in the mango drink, multiply the total liters by 1/9:
Water in mango drink = 16 * 1/9 = 16/9 ≈ 1.78 liters.

2. You have 14 liters of apple drink, which is one-half water.
To find the amount of water in the apple drink, multiply the total liters by 1/2:
Water in apple drink = 14 * 1/2 = 7 liters.

3. You spill 7 liters of the mango drink. Since the amount of water in the mango drink is approximately 1.78 liters for every 16 liters, for 7 liters spilled, the amount of water spilled is:
Water spilled = 7 * (1.78 / 16) ≈ 0.78 liters.

Now, you have:
- 9 liters of mango drink left (16 - 7 = 9)
- The amount of water in the remaining mango drink is:
Water in remaining mango drink = 9 * (1/9) = 1 liter.

4. You add 7 liters of water to make up for the spill.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water in the final mix:
- Water in apple drink = 7 liters
- Water in remaining mango drink = 1 liter
- Water added = 7 liters
Total water in final mix = 7 + 1 + 7 = 15 liters

5. To find the total volume of the final mix, add the remaining mango drink, apple drink, and the added water:
Total volume = 9 + 14 + 7 = 30 liters

6. To find the percentage of water in the final mix, divide the total water by the total volume and multiply by 100:
Percentage of water = (15 / 30) * 100 = 0.5 * 100 = 50%

If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 10 hours if she spends 2/5 of the time running, 1/2 of the time skipping, and the remaining of the time walking?",27.0,"To solve this problem, we need to first find Mei's running and walking speeds. 

Mei can skip at 2 miles per hour, and since she can skip at a rate that is 1/2 as fast as she can run, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2. 

Running speed = 2 * skipping speed 
Running speed = 2 * 2 miles/hour 
Running speed = 4 miles/hour 

Since Mei can run four times faster than she can walk, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4. 

Walking speed = running speed / 4 
Walking speed = 4 miles/hour / 4 
Walking speed = 1 mile/hour 

Now, let's calculate the distance Mei can travel in 10 hours. She spends 2/5 of her time running, which is (2/5) * 10 hours = 4 hours. Since her running speed is 4 miles/hour, the distance she can travel by running is 4 miles/hour * 4 hours = 16 miles.

Mei spends 1/2 of her time skipping, which is (1/2) * 10 hours = 5 hours. Since her skipping speed is 2 miles/hour, the distance she can travel by skipping is 2 miles/hour * 5 hours = 10 miles.

The remaining time is 10 hours - 4 hours - 5 hours = 1 hour. Mei spends this time walking. Since her walking speed is 1 mile/hour, the distance she can travel by walking is 1 mile/hour * 1 hour = 1 mile.

Now, we can find the total distance Mei can travel by adding the distances she travels by running, skipping, and walking. 

Total distance = 16 miles + 10 miles + 1 mile 
Total distance = 27 miles",27.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Mei can skip at 2 miles per hour.
Since she can skip at a rate of speed that is 1/2 as fast as she can run, she can run at 2 * 2 = 4 miles per hour.

Mei can run four times faster than she can walk, so she can walk at 4 / 4 = 1 mile per hour.

Mei spends 2/5 of the time running, which is (2/5) * 10 = 4 hours.
She spends 1/2 of the time skipping, which is (1/2) * 10 = 5 hours.
The remaining time is spent walking, which is 10 - 4 - 5 = 1 hour.

The distance Mei travels while running is 4 miles/hour * 4 hours = 16 miles.
The distance Mei travels while skipping is 2 miles/hour * 5 hours = 10 miles.
The distance Mei travels while walking is 1 mile/hour * 1 hour = 1 mile.

The total distance Mei travels is 16 + 10 + 1 = 27 miles.

If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?",180.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the remaining daily calorie target**

You've already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories, which means you've burned an additional 100 calories. To find your remaining daily calorie target, subtract the calories you've already consumed and burned from your total daily target:

2300 (daily target) - 1200 (consumed) - 100 (burned) = 1000 calories remaining

**Step 2: Calculate the total calories in the bag of cookies**

The bag of cookies has 5 servings, and each serving has 200 calories. To find the total calories in the bag, multiply the number of servings by the calories per serving:

5 servings × 200 calories/serving = 1000 calories

**Step 3: Calculate the number of calories you can eat from the bag**

Since you have 1000 calories remaining in your daily target, and the entire bag of cookies has 1000 calories, you can eat the entire bag if you want to use up all your remaining calories. However, we need to find out how many ounces that corresponds to.

**Step 4: Calculate the number of ounces you can eat**

The bag of cookies is 150 oz, and you can eat the entire bag (1000 calories). To find the number of ounces you can eat, you can simply use the entire bag:

150 oz (entire bag) × (1000 calories / 1000 calories) = 150 oz

So, you can eat up to 150 oz of cookies if you want to use up all your remaining calories. However, please keep in mind that it's not recommended to consume an entire bag of cookies in one sitting!",150.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories are left in your daily target. 
You have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories, which means you have burned 100 calories.
So, the total calories you have consumed or burned is 1200 - 100 = 1100 calories.
Your daily target is 2300 calories.
So, the number of calories left is 2300 - 1100 = 1200 calories.

Now, we need to find out how many servings of cookies you can eat with the remaining calories.
Each serving of cookies has 200 calories.
You have 1200 calories left.
So, the number of servings you can eat is 1200 / 200 = 6 servings.

Since the bag has 5 servings, you can eat the whole bag and still have 1 serving left.
But we need to find out how many oz you can eat.
The bag is 150 oz and has 5 servings.
So, each serving is 150 / 5 = 30 oz.

Since you can eat 6 servings, but the bag only has 5 servings, you can eat the whole bag which is 150 oz, and still have 1 serving left, which is 30 oz.
So, the total oz you can eat is 150 oz.

First, we need to find out how many calories are left in the daily target.
The daily calorie target is 2300.
You have already consumed 1200 calories.
You also exercised for 100 calories, which means you burned 100 calories.
So, the net calories consumed is 1200 - 100 = 1100.
The remaining calories allowed is 2300 - 1100 = 1200.

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in the bag of cookies.
The bag of cookies has 5 servings.
Each serving has 200 calories.
So, the total calories in the bag is 5 * 200 = 1000 calories.

Now, we need to find out how many calories you can eat from the bag.
You have 1200 calories left in your daily target.
The bag of cookies has 1000 calories.
You can eat up to 1200 calories, but not more than the total calories in the bag.
So, you can eat up to 1000 calories from the bag.

Finally, we need to find out how many oz you can eat.
The bag of cookies is 150 oz.
You can eat up to 1000 calories from the bag.
Since each serving is 200 calories, you can eat up to 1000 / 200 = 5 servings.
Since the bag has 5 servings, you can eat up to 5/5 = 1 bag.

Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 4 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Kayla remain with?",703.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of potted plants Kayla already has**

Kayla has 12 potted plants on each of the 65 window ledges. To find the total number of plants, multiply the number of plants per ledge by the number of ledges:

12 plants/ledge × 65 ledges = 780 plants

**Step 2: Add the new potted plants Kayla received last week**

Kayla received 43 new potted plants last week. Add these to the total number of plants she already had:

780 plants + 43 plants = 823 plants

**Step 3: Calculate the number of new plants Kayla purchased yesterday**

Kayla purchased 140 new plants at a 50% discount. Since the discount doesn't affect the number of plants, we can ignore it for now. Add these new plants to the total:

823 plants + 140 plants = 963 plants

**Step 4: Calculate the number of plants Kayla will give away**

Kayla will give away 4 potted plants from each of the 65 window ledges. To find the total number of plants she'll give away, multiply the number of plants per ledge by the number of ledges:

4 plants/ledge × 65 ledges = 260 plants

**Step 5: Subtract the number of plants Kayla will give away from the total**

Subtract the number of plants Kayla will give away from the total number of plants:

963 plants - 260 plants = 703 plants

Therefore, Kayla will remain with **703 potted plants**.",703.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's find out how many miles 1/3 of the city is:

1/3 of 18 miles = 18 / 3 = 6 miles

Now, we know that it takes 41 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city. To find out how many minutes it takes to cover 6 miles, we can set up a proportion:

41 minutes / 3 miles = x minutes / 6 miles

We can cross-multiply:

41 × 6 = 3 × x
246 = 3x

Now, divide both sides by 3:

x = 246 / 3

If he watched 24 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?",5.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Noah watched a total of 24 hours of TV. We need to find out how many 15-minute episodes he watched on Monday.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours he watched on Saturday and Sunday:

4 hours/night x 2 nights = 8 hours

Next, let's calculate the total number of hours he watched on Tuesday:

3 hours + 45 minutes = 3.75 hours ( converted 45 minutes to hours by dividing by 60)

Now, let's calculate the total number of hours he watched on Wednesday:

2 x 5 hours = 10 hours

On Thursday, he watched four episodes, each 15 minutes. Let's convert this to hours:

4 x 15 minutes = 60 minutes = 1 hour

Now, let's add up the total number of hours he watched on all days except Monday:

8 hours + 3.75 hours + 10 hours + 1 hour = 22.75 hours

Since he watched a total of 24 hours, the number of hours he watched on Monday is:

24 hours - 22.75 hours = 1.25 hours

Now, let's convert this to 15-minute episodes:

1.25 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Since each episode is 15 minutes, the number of episodes he watched on Monday is:

75 minutes / 15 minutes/episode = 5 episodes

Therefore, Noah watched 5 episodes of the 15-minute show on Monday.",15.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Noah watched 4-hour episodes on Saturday and Sunday, which is 4 + 4 = 8 hours.

He watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show on Tuesday. 45 minutes is 0.75 hours, so the total hours watched on Tuesday is 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.

He watched two 5-hour episodes on Wednesday, which is 5 + 5 = 10 hours.

The total hours watched on Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday, and Wednesday is 8 + 3.75 + 10 = 21.75 hours.

Noah watched a total of 24 hours of TV, so he watched 24 - 21.75 = 2.25 hours on Monday and Thursday.

Noah watched 15-minute episodes on Monday and four episodes on Thursday, each 15 minutes. Since 15 minutes is 0.25 hours, the total hours watched on Thursday is 0.25 * 4 = 1 hour.

This means Noah watched 2.25 - 1 = 1.25 hours of TV on Monday.

Let's start by using the given ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water, which is 63:14. We can set up a proportion to relate the number of teaspoons of sugar (S) to the number of cups of water (W):

S/W = 63/14

We are also given that Fatima used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk. Let's call the number of tablespoons of milk M. We know that M = 9/7 W (since she uses 9 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water).

We can set up an equation to represent the total amount:

S + W + M = 760

Substituting M = 9/7 W, we get:

S + W + 9/7 W = 760

Combine like terms:

S + 16/7 W = 760

Now, we can use the proportion S/W = 63/14 to express S in terms of W:

S = 63/14 W

Substitute this into the previous equation:

63/14 W + 16/7 W = 760

Multiply both sides by 14 to eliminate fractions:

63 W + 32 W = 760 × 14

Combine like terms:

95 W = 10640

Now, divide by 95:

W = 10640/95
W = 112

Now that we know W, we can find S:

S = 63/14 W
S = 63/14 × 112
S = 63 × 8
S = 504

So, Fatima used 504 teaspoons of sugar.",504.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 63:14.
The ratio of cups of water to tablespoons of milk is 7:9.
We can simplify the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water to tablespoons of milk as 63:14:18 (by multiplying 14 by 9/7).

The total number of parts in the ratio is 63 + 14 + 18 = 95.
The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk used is 760.

To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, we need to find the value of one part of the ratio.
We can do this by dividing the total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk used by the total number of parts in the ratio.
So, one part of the ratio is equal to 760 / 95 = 8.

Since the ratio of teaspoons of sugar is 63, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used is 63 * 8 = 504.

The cost of 6 rulers is 6 * ₣9.00 = ₣54.00.
The cost of 1 rim of bond paper is ₣10.00.
The cost of 3 crayons is 3 * ₣11.00 = ₣33.00.

Next, we need to find the total cost of all items without the discount.
The total cost is ₣33.00 + ₣54.00 + ₣10.00 + ₣33.00 = ₣130.00.

Now, we need to calculate the 10% discount on the total cost.
The discount amount is 10% of ₣130.00, which is 0.10 * ₣130.00 = ₣13.00.

Finally, we need to subtract the discount from the total cost to find the amount Arjun actually spent.
The amount Arjun spent is ₣130.00 - ₣13.00 = ₣117.00.

How much more money will she have if she hires a financial advisor?",1148.0,"To determine how much more money Isabella will have if she hires a financial advisor, we need to calculate the total cost of doing her taxes herself and compare it to the cost of hiring a financial advisor.

If she does her taxes herself, she'll lose 12 hours of consulting work at ₣82/hour, which is a total of:

12 hours x ₣82/hour = ₣984

Additionally, she'll need to spend 3 hours mailing the completed tax documents, which will also reduce her consulting time. This is a total of:

3 hours x ₣82/hour = ₣246

So, the total cost of doing her taxes herself is:

₣984 + ₣246 = ₣1230

Now, let's compare this to the cost of hiring a financial advisor, which is ₣82. 

However, the question is how much more money will she have if she hires a financial advisor. So we need to see the difference between the money she loses doing her taxes herself and the money she loses hiring a financial advisor.

To do this, we need to look at how much she loses if she hires a financial advisor. 

If she hires a financial advisor, it'll cost her ₣82. But she won't lose 12 + 3 = 15 hours of consulting work, so she won't lose ₣1230. She'll gain ₣1230 - ₣82 = ₣1148.

However, this is still not correct. We must subtract the ₣82 she loses from hiring an advisor, from the total amount of money she'll have if she hires a financial advisor.

₣1230 - ₣82 = ₣1148 

But this is the amount of money she'll gain if she hires a financial advisor. We want to know how much more money she'll have if she hires a financial advisor, not how much she'll gain. We can assume that if she does her taxes herself, she won't have any money. This is because doing her taxes herself, will make her lose money. However, the question is how much more money will she have if she hires a financial advisor. 

So we need to add the amount of money she'll have if she does her taxes herself, to the amount of money she'll gain if she hires a financial advisor.

The amount of money she'll have if she does her taxes herself is ₣0, and the amount of money she'll gain if she hires a financial advisor is ₣1148.

₣0 + ₣1148 = ₣1148

If she hires a financial advisor, she'll need to pay the advisor ₣82.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row?,43.75,"To find the probability that Luis rolls a number greater than 10 on a 20-sided die, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes.

There are 10 numbers greater than 10 on a 20-sided die (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20), and there are 20 possible outcomes in total. 

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is:

P(>10) = 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5

Now, let's find the probability that Luis rolls four odd numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling an odd number on a 20-sided die is 1/2, since there are 10 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19) out of 20 possible outcomes.

Since the rolls are independent, we can multiply the probabilities together to find the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row:

P(4 odd) = (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/16 = 0.0625

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities and express it as a percentage:

Difference = P(>10) - P(4 odd) = 0.5 - 0.0625 = 0.4375

To express this as a percentage, we can multiply by 100:

Percentage difference = 0.4375 × 100% ≈ 43.75%

So, it is approximately 43.75% more likely that Luis rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row.",10.0,0,"A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the probability that Luis rolls a number greater than 10.
There are 20 possible outcomes when rolling a 20-sided die.
The numbers greater than 10 are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20, for a total of 10 numbers.
So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is 10/20 = 0.5 or 50%.

Next, let's calculate the probability that Luis rolls four odd numbers in a row.
The probability of rolling an odd number on a 20-sided die is 10/20 = 0.5, since there are 10 odd numbers.
To roll four odd numbers in a row, we need to multiply the probabilities together: (10/20) * (10/20) * (10/20) * (10/20) = (0.5)^4 = 0.0625 or 6.25%.

Now, let's calculate how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll four odd numbers in a row.
The difference in probabilities is 50% - 6.25% = 43.75%.
However, the question asks for the percentage difference, which is the difference divided by the original probability, expressed as a percentage.
But here the question is asking for ""how much more likely"" so we just need to express the difference as a percentage.
So, it is 43.75% / 6.25% = 7 times more likely to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll four odd numbers in a row, or 700% more likely to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll four odd numbers in a row.
However, if we really want to express the answer as a percentage, then 700% more likely is the same as 43.75% is the portion more likely, that Luis will roll a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row.
The answer is 700%.",700.0,0,"Q: Luis is rolling a 20-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row?
A: Let's think step by step.

To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 10, we first need to count the favorable outcomes (numbers 11-20) and the total possible outcomes (numbers 1-20).
There are 10 numbers greater than 10.
There are 20 total numbers.
So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is 10/20 = 0.5.

To find the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row, we first need to find the probability of rolling an odd number, which is 10/20 = 0.5.
Since each roll is independent, we raise the probability of rolling an odd number to the power of 4.
So, the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row is (0.5)^4 = 0.0625.

Now, we can find the difference in probabilities.
The difference is 0.5 - 0.0625 = 0.4375.

1. Yuki was a pen pal with 8 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 4 of them. So, he is now pen pals with:

8 - 4 = 4 people

2. Each of these 4 people sends 3 letters a week, and Yuki responds in kind. So, the total number of letters exchanged per week is:

Yuki responds in kind, so he also writes 120 pages a week.
There are 7 days in a week.
So, the average number of pages Yuki writes in a day is 120 / 7 = 17.14 pages per day.

Selling price = $500,000
Discount = 10% of $500,000 = 0.1 * $500,000 = $50,000
Discounted price = $500,000 - $50,000 = $450,000

Mateo also has to pay 35% as income tax. How much money did Mateo make after tax in September if the company performed very well for the whole month?",1703.0,"To find out how much Mateo made after tax in September, we need to calculate his total earnings for the month and then subtract the income tax.

Step 1: Calculate Mateo's total hours worked in a week:
Mateo works 6 hours a day, 3 days a week, so his total hours worked in a week is:
6 hours/day x 3 days/week = 18 hours/week

Step 2: Calculate Mateo's weekly earnings:
Mateo earns ₣25 per hour, so his weekly earnings are:
18 hours/week x ₣25/hour = ₣450/week

Step 3: Calculate Mateo's monthly earnings:
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Mateo's monthly earnings are:
₣450/week x 4 weeks/month = ₣1800/month

Step 4: Add the weekly bonus to Mateo's monthly earnings:
Mateo gets a ₣205 bonus each week, so his total bonus for the month is:
₣205/week x 4 weeks/month = ₣820/month
Adding this to his monthly earnings, we get:
₣1800/month + ₣820/month = ₣2620/month

Step 5: Calculate Mateo's income tax:
Mateo has to pay 35% of his earnings as income tax, so his income tax is:
₣2620/month x 0.35 = ₣917/month

Step 6: Calculate Mateo's take-home pay:
Finally, we subtract the income tax from Mateo's total earnings to get his take-home pay:
₣2620/month - ₣917/month = ₣1703/month

Therefore, Mateo made ₣1703 after tax in September.",1703.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Mateo works 6 hours a day, 3 days a week.

72 (initial people) - 48 (people who left) = 24 people remaining

We know that 22 lawyers remained. To find the number of nurses who remained, we subtract the number of lawyers from the total number of people remaining:

Ananya also donated $5 at a charity stand, so we'll add that to the total cost:

Total cost of all purchases and donation = $834 + $5 = $839

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the initial $1200:

$1200 - $839 = $361

Ananya has $361 left.",361.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Ananya starts with $1200.

She buys 23 kgs of saltwater taffy. The first 16 kgs cost $23 per kg, so that's 16 * $23 = $368. The next 4 kgs are half off, so that's 4 * ($23 / 2) = $46. The remaining 3 kgs cost $23 per kg, so that's 3 * $23 = $69. The total cost of saltwater taffy is $368 + $46 + $69 = $483.

She also buys a mixed bag of starfish for $11.0.

She buys 17 keychains that cost $20.0 each, so that's 17 * $20 = $340.

The total cost of all the items is $483 + $11 + $340 = $834.

Ananya then donates $5 at a charity stand.

So, the total amount spent is $834 + $5 = $839.

How many giants each person have slew on average?",480.0,"To find the average number of giants each person slew, we need to first find the total number of giants each person slew. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Theo slew 450 giants.
2. Jamal slew three-fifths as many giants as Theo:
   3/5 × 450 = 270 giants

3. Luis slew four times as many giants as Jamal:
   4 × 270 = 1080 giants

4. Oscar slew 1/9 as many giants as Luis:

Theo slew 450 giants.

Jamal slew three-fifths as many giants as Theo.
So, the number of giants Jamal slew is 3/5 * 450 = 270.

Luis slew four times as many giants as Jamal.
So, the number of giants Luis slew is 4 * 270 = 1080.

Oscar slew 1/9 as many giants as Luis.
So, the number of giants Oscar slew is 1/9 * 1080 = 120.

Now we need to find the total number of giants they slew.
Total number of giants = 450 + 270 + 1080 + 120 = 1920.

Andre spent $100 and got 4 bags of crackers, 7 packs of pretzels, and had 3% of his money left in change. How many gum did he buy?",45.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the total amount Andre spent on crackers and pretzels:

4 bags of crackers = 4 x 75 cents = 300 cents = $3
7 packs of pretzels = 7 x $7 = $49

Total amount spent on crackers and pretzels = $3 + $49 = $52

Since Andre spent a total of $100 and had 3% of his money left as change, we can calculate the amount he spent on gum:

Amount spent on gum = Total amount spent - Amount spent on crackers and pretzels
= $100 - $52
= $48

Now, let's calculate the number of gum packs Andre bought:

Cost of one pack of gum = 100 cents = $1
Number of gum packs = Amount spent on gum / Cost of one pack of gum
= $48 / $1
= 48

So, Andre bought 48 packs of gum.",48.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
Andre spent $100 and had 3% of his money left as change.
The amount of money spent is 100 - (3% of 100) = 100 - 3 = $97.
He bought 4 bags of crackers for 75 cents each, so the cost of crackers is 4 * 0.75 = $3.
He bought 7 packs of pretzels for $7 each, so the cost of pretzels is 7 * 7 = $49.
The total cost of crackers and pretzels is $3 + $49 = $52.
The remaining amount spent on gum is $97 - $52 = $45.
Since each pack of gum costs $1 (100 cents), the number of gum packs bought is $45 / $1 = 45.

If the length of his room is 16 feet longer that its width, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?",68.0,"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to find the length and width of the room first. Let's start by using the information that the length is 16 feet longer than the width.

Let's call the width ""w"". Then, the length is w + 16.

We know that the area of the room is 225 square feet, so we can set up an equation:

Area = Length x Width
225 = (w + 16) x w

Now, let's expand the equation:

225 = w^2 + 16w

This is a quadratic equation. To solve for w, we can rearrange the equation to get:

w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0

Now, let's factor the equation:

(w + 25)(w - 9) = 0

This tells us that either w + 25 = 0 or w - 9 = 0.

Solving for w, we get:

w + 25 = 0 --> w = -25 (this is not possible, since width cannot be negative)

w - 9 = 0 --> w = 9

So, the width of the room is 9 feet.

Now, we can find the length:

Length = w + 16
= 9 + 16
= 25 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter:

Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
= 2(25 + 9)
= 2 x 34
= 68 feet

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 68 feet.",68.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
The area of the office is 225 square feet.
The length of the room is 16 feet longer than its width.
Let's call the width x. Then, the length is x + 16.
The area of the room is the product of its length and width, so we have the equation:
x(x + 16) = 225
Expanding the equation, we get:
x^2 + 16x = 225
Rearranging the equation, we get:
x^2 + 16x - 225 = 0
Solving for x, we get:
(x + 25)(x - 9) = 0
This gives us two possible values for x: x = -25 (which is not possible since width can't be negative) or x = 9.
So, the width of the room is 9 feet, and the length is 9 + 16 = 25 feet.
The perimeter of the room is the sum of all its sides, which is 2(length + width).
So, the perimeter of the room is 2(9 + 25) = 2(34) = 68 feet.

The shark's body length in astronomical units is 75 * 5.878625e-",5.878625,0,"Let's think step by step.

Ali saw a 75-foot shark with 15 15-inch remoras attached to it.
First, we need to convert the length of the shark to inches, since the remoras are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so the shark is 75 * 12 = 900 inches long.

Each remora is 15 inches long, and there are 15 remoras, so the total length of the remoras is 15 * 15 = 225 inches.

But 1/5 of the remoras go away, which means 1/5 * 15 = 3 remoras leave. So, the number of remoras left is 15 - 3 = 12.

The total length of the remaining remoras is 12 * 15 = 180 inches.

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remaining remoras occupy, we need to divide the length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100.

So, the percentage is (180 / 900) * 100 = 20.0.

Wait, that's the same answer I got before! But I know that's incorrect. Let me recheck my work.

Ah, I see the mistake. I made a calculation error. The correct calculation is:

The remoras are 15 inches long, and there are 12 remoras left, so the total length of the remoras is 12 * 15 = 180 inches.

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remaining remoras occupy, we need to divide the length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100.

So, the percentage is (180 / 900) * 100 = 20.0.

Sanjay has 10 tubes of pink paint and 3 tubes of blue paint.
Yuki has 2/4 as many tubes of pink paint as Sanjay. 2/4 means half, so Yuki has half of 10 tubes of pink paint, which is 10 / 2 = 5 tubes of pink paint.
Yuki has thrice as many tubes of blue paint as Sanjay, which is 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of blue paint.

How many crackers won't he be able to place on the bowls or plates?",11.0,"To find out how many crackers Deshawn won't be able to place on the bowls or plates, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of crackers that can fit on the bowls and plates.
2. Calculate the number of crackers Deshawn has left after eating a third.
3. Subtract the total number of crackers that can fit on the bowls and plates from the number of crackers Deshawn has left.

Step 1: Calculate the number of crackers that can fit on the bowls and plates.

Each bowl can hold 21 crackers. There are 11 bowls, so the total number of crackers that can fit on the bowls is:
11 x 21 = 231

Each plate can hold 2 x 21 = 42 crackers. There are 4 plates, so the total number of crackers that can fit on the plates is:

Therefore, Deshawn won't be able to place 11 crackers on the bowls or plates.",11.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many crackers each plate can hold. Since each plate can hold two times the number of crackers that each bowl can hold, and each bowl can hold 21 crackers, each plate can hold 2 * 21 = 42 crackers.

Next, we need to find out the total number of crackers that the bowls and plates can hold. There are 11 bowls, each holding 21 crackers, so the total number of crackers that the bowls can hold is 11 * 21 = 231. There are 4 plates, each holding 42 crackers, so the total number of crackers that the plates can hold is 4 * 42 = 168.

Now, we add the total number of crackers that the bowls and plates can hold: 231 + 168 = 399.

Deshawn has 615 crackers, but he eats a third of them. To find out how many crackers he eats, we divide 615 by 3: 615 / 3 = 205. So, Deshawn eats 205 crackers.

**Step 1: Find Jasmine's current age**

We know that in 4 years, Jasmine will be 4 times as old as James is now. James is currently 8 years old, so in 4 years, Jasmine will be 4 x 8 = 32 years old.

Since Jasmine will be 32 years old in 4 years, we can subtract 4 from 32 to find her current age:

**Step 1: Find the time it takes Carlos to swim a kilometer on a warm day**

When the water is warm, Carlos swims a kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times as long as he does when the water is cold. Since he swims a kilometer in 11 minutes when the water is cold, four times that is:

4 × 11 = 44 minutes

Adding 9 minutes to that gives:

How much money does he have left, if he receives a 25% discount on the puzzle and a 20% on the pencil?",328.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Noah has**

Noah has 7 ¥50 bills, so the total amount of money he has is:

7 x ¥50 = ¥350

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the puzzles with a 25% discount**

The original price of each puzzle is ¥4. With a 25% discount, the price of each puzzle becomes:

¥4 - (25% of ¥4) = ¥4 - ¥1 = ¥3

Since Noah buys 2 puzzles, the total cost of the puzzles is:

2 x ¥3 = ¥6

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the pencils with a 20% discount**

The original price of each pack of pencils is ¥5. With a 20% discount, the price of each pack of pencils becomes:

¥5 - (20% of ¥5) = ¥5 - ¥1 = ¥4

Since Noah buys 4 packs of pencils, the total cost of the pencils is:

4 x ¥4 = ¥16

**Step 4: Calculate the total amount Noah spends**

The total amount Noah spends is the sum of the cost of the puzzles and the pencils:

¥6 (puzzles) + ¥16 (pencils) = ¥22

**Step 5: Calculate the amount of money Noah has left**

First, let's find the amount each alpaca needs. Since each alpaca needs 3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 9 kilograms:

2 * 9 kilograms = 18 kilograms (twice the amount each goat needs)
18 kilograms - 3 kilograms = 15 kilograms (3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs)

So, each alpaca needs 15 kilograms.

Now, let's find the amount each cow needs. Since each cow eats as much as a goat and alpaca eat combined:

9 kilograms (goat) + 15 kilograms (alpaca) = 24 kilograms (combined amount for a goat and an alpaca)

So, each cow needs 24 kilograms.

Now, let's multiply the amount each type of animal needs by the number of animals:

Goats: 9 kilograms * 21 goats = 189 kilograms
Alpacas: 15 kilograms * 7 alpacas = 105 kilograms
Cows: 24 kilograms * 21 cows = 504 kilograms

Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.",50.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of occupied beds**

The hospital has a capacity of 800 beds, and 1/8 of them are occupied. To find the number of occupied beds, we'll multiply the total capacity by 1/8.

 Occupied beds = 800 x 1/8
= 800 x 0.125
= 100 beds

**Step 2: Calculate the number of beds out of service**

One-fifth of all the beds are out of service. To find the number of beds out of service, we'll multiply the total capacity by 1/5.

Beds out of service = 800 x 1/5
= 800 x 0.2
= 160 beds

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of unavailable beds**

The total number of unavailable beds is the sum of occupied beds and beds out of service.

Unavailable beds = Occupied beds + Beds out of service
= 100 + 160
= 260 beds

**Step 4: Calculate the initial number of unoccupied beds**

The initial number of unoccupied beds is the total capacity minus the unavailable beds.

Initial unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Unavailable beds

**Step 5: Calculate the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks**

The hospital admits 35 patients per day. To find the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks, we'll multiply the daily admission rate by the number of days in 2 weeks (14 days).

Patients admitted in 2 weeks = 35 patients/day x 14 days
= 490 patients

**Step 6: Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks**

The total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is the initial number of unoccupied beds minus the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks.

Total unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = Initial unoccupied beds - Patients admitted in 2 weeks
= 540 - 490
= 50 beds

On Tuesday, Andre sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday, so he sold 24 + 11 = 35 boxes of cupcakes. He sold 28 boxes of orange pie, so x = 28.

Now we know that on Monday, Andre sold 24 boxes of cupcakes and 28 - 16 = 12 boxes of orange pie.

On Tuesday, Andre sold 35 boxes of cupcakes and 28 boxes of orange pie.

On Wednesday, Andre sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. So, he sold (24 + 35) boxes of cupcakes = 59 boxes of cupcakes, and (12 + 28) boxes of orange pie = 40 boxes of orange pie.

Number of volleyball players = 125 x 0.24 = 30

**Step 2: Calculate the number of volleyball players leaving early (excluding absent students)**

Number of volleyball players absent = 30 x 0.5 = 15 (since half of the volleyball players are absent)

Number of cheerleaders accompanying each group = 3 x 3 = 9 (since there are 3 groups: volleyball, robotics, and choir)
Total number of students leaving early (including cheerleaders) = 53 + 9 = 62

140 feet ÷ 16 feet (space per plant) = 8.75 (round down to 8, since we can't have a fraction of a plant)

Since Mei already owns 8 flowers, she can fit 8 more plants in her flower bed. However, she only needs to buy the additional plants to fill the remaining space. Let's calculate the remaining space:
143 feet (flower bed length) - 8 plants × 16 feet (space per plant) = 143 - 128 = 15 feet

Mei can fit one more plant in the remaining 15 feet, since 15 feet is greater than the 13 feet space required between plants, but less than the 16 feet space required for a plant. Therefore, Mei needs to buy 1 more plant.

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the plants**

Mei needs to buy 1 more plant, and each plant costs €9. However, since she's buying more than 2 plants in total (she already owns 8, and she's buying 1 more), she'll receive a €5 discount on the entire purchase.

Total cost = 1 plant × €9 = €9
Discount = €5 (since she's buying more than 2 plants in total)
Total cost after discount = €9 - €5 = €4

Therefore, Mei will spend €4 at the store to fill up her flower bed.",4.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Mei's flower bed is 143 feet long.
Each plant takes up 3 feet (its width) and needs 13 feet of space between it and the next plant.
So, the total space taken up by each plant is 3 + 13 = 16 feet.
Mei already has 8 flowers, so she needs to fill the remaining space.
The total space available is 143 feet.
The space taken up by the 8 flowers she already has is 8 * 16 = 128 feet.
However, this is not correct, since the 8 flowers she already has will take up 8 * 3 = 24 feet for the flowers themselves, and 7 * 13 = 91 feet for the spaces between them (since there are 7 spaces between 8 flowers).
So, the total space taken up by the 8 flowers she already has is 24 + 91 = 115 feet.
The remaining space is 143 - 115 = 28 feet.
Since each plant takes up 16 feet of space, Mei can fit 28 / 16 = 1.75 plants in the remaining space.
However, she can't buy a fraction of a plant, so she'll need to buy 2 more plants to fill the space.
Each plant costs €9, so the total cost would be 2 * 9 = €18.
However, since Mei is buying more than 2 plants (she's buying 2, and she already has 8, so she's buying a total of 10), she'll receive a €5 discount on the entire purchase.
So, the total amount Mei will spend at the store is 18 - 5 = €13.
The answer is 13.",13.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Mei's flower bed is 143 feet long.
Each plant takes up 3 feet (its width) and needs 13 feet of space between plants.
So, the total space taken up by each plant is 3 + 13 = 16 feet.
To find out how many plants Mei can fit in her flower bed, we divide the length of the flower bed by the space taken up by each plant: 143 / 16 = 8.9375.
Since Mei can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 8 plants. However, Mei already owns 8 flowers, but she can only fit 8 plants in her flower bed, so she actually needs to buy 0 more plants to fill the flower bed, but since she can't buy a negative number of

How long will it take her to peel and saute 60 clams if it takes 19 minutes to wash all the clams? Note that Yara can't work in parallel.,53.0,"To find the time Yara will take to peel and saute 60 clams, we first need to find the time she takes to peel and saute the clams, then add the time it takes her to wash the clams. 

1. Time to wash the clams: 19 minutes
2. Time to peel the clams: Yara can peel 6 clams a minute. To peel 60 clams, it will take 60 / 6 = 10 minutes.
3. Time to saute the clams: Yara can saute 20 clams in 8 minutes. To saute 60 clams, we need to divide 60 by 20 and multiply by 8. 60 / 20 = 3. So, it will take 3 * 8 = 24 minutes to saute 60 clams.
4. Total time: 19 minutes (washing) + 10 minutes (peeling) + 24 minutes (sauteing) = 53 minutes.

So, it will take Yara 53 minutes to peel, saute, and wash 60 clams.",60.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Yara needs to wash 60 clams, which takes 19 minutes.

She can peel clams at a rate of 6 clams per minute.
To peel 60 clams, she will need 60 / 6 = 10 minutes.

She can sauté 20 clams in 8 minutes.
To sauté 60 clams, she will need (60 / 20) * 8 = 24 minutes.

The total time taken to wash, peel, and sauté 60 clams is 19 + 10 + 24 = 53 minutes.

The answer is 53.",53.0,1,,53.0,1

Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet. How much older is Liam's uncle than Liam?,22.0,"To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Liam and his uncle when Liam saw the comet for the second time.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Liam's uncle saw the comet when he was 31 years old.
2. Comet Halley orbits the Sun every 53 years, so the next time it appears, Liam's uncle will be 31 + 53 = 84 years old.
3. Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet. This means Liam was 2 x 31 = 62 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
4. Since Liam's uncle was 84 years old when Liam saw the comet for the second time, we can find the age difference between Liam and his uncle by subtracting Liam's age from his uncle's age: 84 - 62 = 22.

Therefore, Liam's uncle is 22 years older than Liam.",22.0,1,"A: Let's think step by step.

Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was 2 times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet, so Liam was 2 * 31 = 62 years old.
However, since Liam saw the comet for the second time, he must have seen it for the first time 53 years ago.
So, Liam's current age is 62, and he saw the comet for the first time when he was 62 - 53 = 9 years old.
Now, we need to find Liam's uncle's age when Liam was 9 years old.
Since Liam's uncle was 31 years old when he saw the comet, and the comet appears every 53 years, Liam's uncle was 31 + 53 = 84 years old when Liam saw the comet for the first time.
Since the difference between Liam's age (9) and his uncle's age (84) is the difference in their ages, the difference is 84 - 9 = 75 years.
However, we are asked for the difference in their current ages, which is the difference in their ages when Liam saw the comet for the second time.
Since Liam is 62 years old, and his uncle is 84 + 53 = 137 years old (because 53 years have passed since Liam's uncle was 84), we can now find the difference in their ages.
The difference is 137 - 62 = 75 years.

Liam's uncle saw the comet when he was 31 years old.
Comet Halley orbits the Sun every 53 years.
So, Liam saw the comet for the first time 53 years after his uncle saw it.
Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet.
This means Liam was 2 * 31 = 62 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
Since Liam saw the comet for the second time 53 years after he saw it for the first time, he was 62 - 53 = 9 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.
Liam's uncle was 31 years old when Liam was 9 years old.
So, the age difference between Liam's uncle and Liam is 31 - 9 = 22 years.
However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the current age difference.
Since Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was 62 years old, and his uncle saw the comet 53 years before that, his uncle is currently 62 + 53 = 115 years old.
Liam is currently 62 years old.
So, the current age difference between Liam's uncle and Liam is 115 - 62 = 53 years.

How many pounds of ore can 11 miners mine in a month with 28 days if they all use bronze pickaxe in the first half, and then switch to diamond pickaxes in the second half of the month?",4312.0,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of ore one miner can mine per day with a bronze pickaxe.**

Since one miner can mine 5 pounds of ore per day with a basic shovel, and a bronze pickaxe allows them to mine twice as much, the amount of ore one miner can mine per day with a bronze pickaxe is:

5 pounds/day x 2 = 10 pounds/day

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of ore one miner can mine per day with a diamond pickaxe.**

A diamond pickaxe allows a miner to mine 80% more than with a bronze pickaxe. To calculate this, we need to find 80% of 10 pounds and add it to 10 pounds:

80% of 10 pounds = 0.8 x 10 = 8 pounds
10 pounds + 8 pounds = 18 pounds/day

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of ore one miner can mine in the first half of the month with a bronze pickaxe.**

There are 14 days in the first half of the month (28 days / 2). The amount of ore one miner can mine in the first half of the month with a bronze pickaxe is:

10 pounds/day x 14 days = 140 pounds

**Step 4: Calculate the total amount of ore one miner can mine in the second half of the month with a diamond pickaxe.**

The amount of ore one miner can mine in the second half of the month with a diamond pickaxe is:

18 pounds/day x 14 days = 252 pounds

**Step 5: Calculate the total amount of ore one miner can mine in a month.**

The total amount of ore one miner can mine in a month is the sum of the amounts mined in the first and second halves:

140 pounds + 252 pounds = 392 pounds

**Step 6: Calculate the total amount of ore 11 miners can mine in a month.**

The total amount of ore 11 miners can mine in a month is:

392 pounds x 11 = 4312 pounds

Therefore, 11 miners can mine 4312 pounds of ore in a month if they use bronze pickaxes in the first half and diamond pickaxes in the second half.",4312.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how much ore one miner can mine with a bronze pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with a bronze pickaxe as with a basic shovel, and he can mine 5 pounds of ore per day with a basic shovel, he can mine 2 * 5 = 10 pounds of ore per day with a bronze pickaxe.

Next, we need to find out how much ore one miner can mine with a diamond pickaxe. Since he can mine 80% more with a diamond pickaxe than with a bronze pickaxe, and he can mine 10 pounds of ore per day with a bronze pickaxe, he can mine 10 + (80% of 10) = 10 + 8 = 18 pounds of ore per day with a diamond pickaxe.

Now, let's calculate how much ore 11 miners can mine in a month with 28 days. In the first half of the month (14 days), they use bronze pickaxes. So, each miner mines 10 pounds of ore per day, and 11 miners mine 11 * 10 = 110 pounds of ore per day. In 14 days, they mine 110 * 14 = 1540 pounds of ore.

In the second half of the month (14 days), they use diamond pickaxes. So, each miner mines 18 pounds of ore per day, and 11 miners mine 11 * 18 = 198 pounds of ore per day. In 14 days, they mine 198 * 14 = 2772 pounds of ore.

Let's say Ananya gets x yards of fence.

Since Tara gets 190 yards more than Ananya, Tara gets x + 190 yards.

Since Umar gets 30 yards more than Tara, Umar gets (x + 190) + 30 = x + 220 yards.

The total amount of fence is 860 yards, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 190) + (x + 220) = 860

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of classes Santiago takes in a week**

Normal classes: 6 periods/day × 4 days/week = 24 periods/week
Extra classes: 3 classes/day × 4 days/week = 12 classes/week
Total classes: 24 periods/week + 12 classes/week = 36 classes/week

**Step 2: Calculate the total time spent in classes**

Each class is 30 minutes long, so:
Total time in classes: 36 classes/week × 30 minutes/class = 1080 minutes/week

**Step 3: Calculate the total time spent reviewing and preparing for classes**

Santiago spends 15 minutes before each class, so:
Total time reviewing and preparing: 36 classes/week × 15 minutes/class = 540 minutes/week

**Step 4: Calculate the total time spent learning during the week**

Total time learning: Total time in classes + Total time reviewing and preparing
= 1080 minutes/week + 540 minutes/week
= 1620 minutes/week

**Step 5: Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday**

Santiago spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes on each of these days, so:
Extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday: (1/9) × 1620 minutes/week = 180 minutes/week
Since there are two days, the total extra learning time is:
180 minutes/week × 2 = 360 minutes/week

**Step 6: Calculate the total time spent learning in a week**

Total time learning: Total time learning during the week + Extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday

**Step 7: Convert the total time from minutes to hours**

He goes to class for 4 days a week, so the total time spent in a week is 405 * 4 = 1620 minutes.

He spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.
One-ninth of 1620 minutes is 1620 / 9 = 180 minutes.

So, the total extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday is 180 * 2 = 360 minutes.

The total time spent learning in a week is 1620 + 360 = 1980 minutes.

So, the time it takes to ride the biggest slide is 300 / 50 = 6 minutes.

The second biggest waterslide is 280 yards long, and people slide down at 70 yards/minute.
So, the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide is 280 / 70 = 4 minutes.

To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to subtract the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide.

A: Let's think step by step.
Olivia walks 10 kilometers on the beach and it takes her 60 minutes.
So, her speed on the beach is 10 km / 60 minutes = 1/6 km per minute.
Her original speed on the beach should be 2 * (1/6) = 1/3 km per minute.
Since she walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, her original speed on the sidewalk should be 4 * (1/3) = 4/3 km per minute.
Her current speed on the sidewalk is half of the original speed, which is 4/3 / 2 = 2/3 km per minute.
Now, we can calculate the time it takes for her to walk on the sidewalk.
The distance walked on the sidewalk is 10 kilometers.
The time it takes to walk on the sidewalk is 10 / (2/3) = 10 * (3/2) = 15 kilometers.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the first 2 complexes**

The first 2 complexes have 300 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these 2 complexes is:

300 + 300 = 600 apartments

**Step 2: Calculate the number of apartments in the last complex**

The last complex is 50% bigger than the other 2 combined, so it has:

600 x 1.5 = 900 apartments

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of apartments**

The total number of apartments is:

600 + 900 = 1500 apartments

**Step 4: Calculate the number of collections per week**

Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is:

2 collections/week x 3 complexes = 6 collections/week

**Step 5: Calculate the total number of collections per week per apartment**

Since there are 1500 apartments, the total number of collections per week per apartment is:

6 collections/week / 1500 apartments = 6 collections/week per apartment (this is not necessary, but it helps to understand the next step)

**Step 6: Calculate the total amount earned per week**

6 collections/week x 1500 apartments x ¥0.45/collection = ¥4050/week

**Step 7: Calculate the total amount earned from tips**

Oliver earns 14% on tips, so the total amount earned from tips is:

¥4050/week x 0.14 = ¥567/week

Alejandro gives 1/5 of the made popcorns to his brother Tariq. How many pieces of popcorn does Alejandro have to eat?",756.0,"To find out how many pieces of popcorn Alejandro has to eat, we'll break down the problem into steps.

1. In the first 22 seconds, 90 kernels pop.

2. In the next 22 seconds, 3 times that amount pop. So, 3 * 90 = 270 kernels pop.

3. In the next 22 seconds, the kernels increase to 4 times the initial popping rate. So, 4 * 90 = 360 kernels pop.

4. In the final 22 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 22 seconds. So, 360 / 2 = 180 kernels pop.

5. After Alejandro takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. So, 180 / 4 = 45 kernels pop.

6. Now, let's find the total number of kernels that popped:
   90 + 270 + 360 + 180 + 45 = 945

7. Alejandro gives 1/5 of the made popcorns to his brother Tariq, so he gives away 945 / 5 = 189 kernels.

8. Finally, to find out how many pieces of popcorn Alejandro has to eat, subtract the number he gave away from the total number:
   945 - 189 = 756

Alejandro has 756 pieces of popcorn to eat.",756.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

In the first 22 seconds, 90 kernels pop.
In the next 22 seconds, 3 times the initial amount pop, so 3 * 90 = 270 kernels pop.

In the final 22 seconds, the kernels pop at half the rate of the past 22 seconds, so 360 / 2 = 180 kernels pop.
From the residual heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds also pop, so 180 / 4 = 45 kernels pop.

Now, let's find the total number of kernels that popped:
90 + 270 + 360 + 180 + 45 = 945 kernels.

Alejandro gives 1/5 of the made popcorns to his brother Tariq, so he gives 945 / 5 = 189 kernels to Tariq.

We know that there are 4 green cubes and five times as many black cubes, which means there are 5 x 4 = 20 black cubes.

We also know that the total number of cubes in the pyramid is 40.

Let's use a variable to represent the number of white cubes. Let's call it W.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of cubes:

4 (green cubes) + 20 (black cubes) + W (white cubes) = 40

Combine the constants:

24 + W = 40

Subtract 24 from both sides:

W = 16

So, there are 16 white cubes.

To find the percentage of white cubes, divide the number of white cubes by the total number of cubes and multiply by 100:

(16 ÷ 40) x 100 = 40%

Therefore, 40% of the cubes in the pyramid are white.",40.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
The pyramid has 4 green cubes.
It has five times as many black cubes as green cubes, which is 5 * 4 = 20 black cubes.
The total number of green and black cubes is 4 + 20 = 24.
There are 40 cubes in the pyramid in total.
So, the number of white cubes is 40 - 24 = 16.
To find the percentage of white cubes, we use the formula: (number of white cubes / total number of cubes) * 100.
The percentage of white cubes is (16 / 40) * 100 = 40%.

If the force need to move the car is 2% of the total weight, how much force does Esteban need to push the car?",44.0,"To find the total weight of the car, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, the children, and the spare tires.

Weight of the car: 1350 pounds
Weight of the luggage: 450 pounds
Weight of the children: 4 x 65 pounds = 260 pounds
Weight of the spare tires: 2 x 70 pounds = 140 pounds

Total weight = Weight of the car + Weight of the luggage + Weight of the children + Weight of the spare tires
Total weight = 1350 + 450 + 260 + 140
Total weight = 2200 pounds

The force needed to move the car is 2% of the total weight. To find 2% of the total weight, we can multiply the total weight by 0.02.

Force needed = Total weight x 0.02
Force needed = 2200 x 0.02
Force needed = 44 pounds

We know that Oscar is 54 years old.

Since Oscar is 27 years younger than Arash, we can find Arash's age by adding 27 to Oscar's age:

Arash's age = Oscar's age + 27
= 54 + 27
= 81

So, Arash is 81 years old.

We also know that Oscar is 18 years older than Ali. To find Ali's age, we can subtract 18 from Oscar's age:

Ali's age = Oscar's age - 18
= 54 - 18
= 36

So, Ali is 36 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all three people:

Oscar: 54
Arash: 81
Ali: 36

To find the average of their ages, we can add their ages and divide by 3:

Average age = (Oscar's age + Arash's age + Ali's age) / 3

The ages of Oscar, Arash, and Ali are 54, 81, and 36 respectively.
To find the average, we need to add their ages and divide by 3: (54 + 81 + 36) / 3 = 171 / 3 = 57.

Lemon cupcakes = 1634

Total non-blueberry cupcakes = Peanut butter cupcakes + Lemon cupcakes
