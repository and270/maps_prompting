She bought 6 dozen eclairs which cost $18 per dozen, 7 dozen cookies which cost $74 per dozen, and 8 dozen muffins for $116 per dozen. How much was the total cost?",1554.0,"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

1. First, let's find the cost of the eclairs:
   Number of dozen eclairs = 6
   Cost per dozen eclairs = $18
   Total cost of eclairs = 6 * $18 = $108

2. Next, let's find the cost of the cookies:
   Number of dozen cookies = 7
   Cost per dozen cookies = $74
   Total cost of cookies = 7 * $74 = $518

3. Now, let's find the cost of the muffins:
   Number of dozen muffins = 8
   Cost per dozen muffins = $116
   Total cost of muffins = 8 * $116 = $928

4. Finally, let's add the costs of all the items together:
   Total cost = $108 + $518 + $928 = $1554

So, the total cost is $1554.",1554.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
Sofia bought 6 dozen eclairs for $18 per dozen.
So, the total cost of eclairs is 6 * $18 = $108.
She bought 7 dozen cookies for $74 per dozen.
So, the total cost of cookies is 7 * $74 = $518.
She bought 8 dozen muffins for $116 per dozen.
So, the total cost of muffins is 8 * $116 = $928.
The total cost is the sum of the cost of eclairs, cookies, and muffins.
So, the total cost is $108 + $518 + $928 = $1554.

But as I pour it, I spill 5 liters of the peach drink. How much water is in the remaining 31 liters?",7.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the peach drink**

You have 20 liters of peach drink that is 1/5 water. To find the amount of water, multiply the total amount of peach drink by the fraction of water:

20 liters x 1/5 = 20 liters x 0.2 = 4 liters of water

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the lemon drink**

You have 16 liters of lemon drink that is 1/4 water. To find the amount of water, multiply the total amount of lemon drink by the fraction of water:

16 liters x 1/4 = 16 liters x 0.25 = 4 liters of water

**Step 3: Calculate the amount of peach drink spilled**

You spilled 5 liters of the peach drink. Since the peach drink is 1/5 water, the amount of water spilled is:

5 liters x 1/5 = 5 liters x 0.2 = 1 liter of water

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining amount of peach drink and water**

After spilling 5 liters, you have:

20 liters - 5 liters = 15 liters of peach drink left

The amount of water left in the peach drink is:

4 liters - 1 liter = 3 liters of water

**Step 5: Calculate the total amount of water in the remaining 31 liters**

You have 15 liters of peach drink left and 16 liters of lemon drink. The total amount of water is:

3 liters (from peach drink) + 4 liters (from lemon drink) = 7 liters of water

So, there are 7 liters of water in the remaining 31 liters of drink.",31.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how much water is in the peach drink. Since the peach drink is 1/5 water, we can calculate the amount of water in the peach drink as follows:
20 liters * 1/5 = 20 * 0.2 = 4 liters of water in the peach drink.

Next, we need to find out how much water is in the lemon drink. Since the lemon drink is 1/4 water, we can calculate the amount of water in the lemon drink as follows:
16 liters * 1/4 = 16 * 0.25 = 4 liters of water in the lemon drink.

Now, we need to subtract the 5 liters of peach drink that were spilled. Since the peach drink is 1/5 water, the amount of water spilled is:
5 liters * 1/5 = 5 * 0.2 = 1 liter of water spilled.

So, the total amount of water left in the peach drink is:
4 liters - 1 liter = 3 liters of water in the peach drink.

The total amount of water in the remaining 31 liters (20 - 5 + 16) is the sum of the water in the peach drink and the lemon drink:
3 liters + 4 liters = 7 liters of water in the remaining 31 liters.

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"Jasmine can run five times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is 3/5 as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 6 hours if she spends 2/4 of the time running and three-sixths of the time walking?",36.0,"To find out how many miles Jasmine can travel, we need to first find out her running speed and walking speed. 

We are given that Jasmine can skip at 6 miles per hour and her skipping speed is 3/5 of her running speed. 

So, let's find out her running speed:
Running speed = Skipping speed / (3/5)
Running speed = 6 / (3/5)
Running speed = 6 * (5/3)
Running speed = 10 miles per hour

We are given that Jasmine runs 5 times faster than she can walk. 
So, her walking speed is:
Walking speed = Running speed / 5
Walking speed = 10 / 5
Walking speed = 2 miles per hour

Now, let's find out how much time she spends running and walking:
Total time = 6 hours
Time spent running = 2/4 * 6 hours = 3 hours
Time spent walking = 3/6 * 6 hours = 3 hours
Time spent skipping is not needed as we know how much time she spends running and walking.

Now, let's find out how many miles Jasmine travels in 6 hours:
Distance run = Running speed * Time spent running
Distance run = 10 miles per hour * 3 hours
Distance run = 30 miles

Distance walked = Walking speed * Time spent walking
Distance walked = 2 miles per hour * 3 hours
Distance walked = 6 miles

Distance skipped is not needed as we know how much distance she covers running and walking. 

Distance traveled = Distance run + Distance walked
Distance traveled = 30 miles + 6 miles
Distance traveled = 36 miles

So, Jasmine can travel 36 miles in 6 hours if she spends 2/4 of the time running and three-sixths of the time walking.",4.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find Jasmine's running speed. We know that she can skip at 6 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is 3/5 as fast as her running speed. So, we can set up an equation:

Skipping speed = (3/5) * Running speed
6 = (3/5) * Running speed

To solve for the running speed, we can multiply both sides by 5/3:

Running speed = 6 * (5/3)
Running speed = 10 miles per hour

Now, we know that Jasmine can run five times faster than she can walk. So, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 5:

Walking speed = Running speed / 5
Walking speed = 10 / 5
Walking speed = 2 miles per hour

Next, we need to find out how much time Jasmine spends running, walking, and skipping. We know that she spends 2/4 of the time running, which is equivalent to 1/2 of the time. We also know that she spends three-sixths of the time walking, which is equivalent to 1/2 of the time. Since she spends the remaining time skipping, we can set up an equation:

Time running + Time walking + Time skipping = Total time
(1/2) * 6 + (1/2) * 6 + Time skipping = 6

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 + 3 + Time skipping = 6
Time skipping = 0

This means that Jasmine doesn't spend any time skipping, which doesn't make sense. However, we can still use the given information to find the distance she travels.

Since Jasmine spends 1/2 of the time running and 1/2 of the time walking, we can find the distance she travels by multiplying her speed by the time she spends running and walking:

Distance running = Running speed * Time running
Distance running = 10 * 3
Distance running = 30 miles

Distance walking = Walking speed * Time walking
Distance walking = 2 * 3
Distance walking = 6 miles

Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking
Total distance = 30 + 6
Total distance = 36 miles

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of breads has 275 calories per serving. If a 300 ounces bag has 5 servings, how many ounces can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2360 and you have already consumed 1700 calories?",144.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total calories in the bag of bread**

We know that the bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 275 calories. To find the total calories in the bag, we multiply the number of servings by the calories per serving:

Total calories = 5 servings × 275 calories/serving = 1375 calories

**Step 2: Calculate the remaining calories you can consume**

You have a daily calorie target of 2360 calories, and you've already consumed 1700 calories. To find out how many calories you can still consume, we subtract the calories you've already eaten from your daily target:

Remaining calories = 2360 - 1700 = 660 calories

**Step 3: Calculate the number of servings you can eat**

Now, we need to find out how many servings of bread you can eat within your remaining calorie limit. We'll divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:

Number of servings = Remaining calories ÷ Calories per serving
= 660 calories ÷ 275 calories/serving
= 2.4 servings (approximately)

**Step 4: Calculate the number of ounces you can eat**

Finally, we need to convert the number of servings to ounces. We know that the bag has 300 ounces and 5 servings. To find the number of ounces per serving, we divide the total ounces by the number of servings:

Ounces per serving = 300 ounces ÷ 5 servings = 60 ounces/serving

Now, we multiply the number of servings you can eat by the ounces per serving:

Ounces you can eat = 2.4 servings × 60 ounces/serving
= 144 ounces

So, you can eat approximately 144 ounces of bread.",144.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories are left in your daily target. 
You have a daily calorie target of 2360 calories.
You have already consumed 1700 calories.

Since the bag of bread has 275 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat within your remaining calorie target.
You can eat 660 calories.
Each serving has 275 calories.
So, the number of servings you can eat is 660 / 275 = 2.4 servings.

Since you can't eat a fraction of a serving, let's assume you can eat 2 servings.

Now, we need to find out how many ounces correspond to 2 servings.
The 300 ounces bag has 5 servings.
So, 1 serving corresponds to 300 / 5 = 60 ounces.
2 servings correspond to 60 * 2 = 120 ounces.

The answer is 120.",120.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day. 
The daily calorie target is 2360.
You have already consumed 1700 calories.
So, the number of calories left is 2360 - 1700 = 660.

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in the bag of breads. 
The bag has 5 servings.
Each serving has 275 calories.
So, the total number of calories in the bag is 5 * 275 = 1375.

Since you can't eat the whole bag, we need to find out how many servings you can eat. 
You have 660 calories left for the day.
Each serving has 275 calories.
So, the number of servings you can eat is 660 / 275 = 2.4 servings.

Finally, we need to find out how many ounces you can eat. 
The bag has 300 ounces.
There are 5 servings in the bag.
So, each serving has 300 / 5 = 60 ounces.
You can eat 2.4 servings.
So, the number of ounces you can eat is 2.4 * 60 = 144 ounces.

She already has 9 potted plants on each of the 64 window ledges. 

Number of potted plants she already has = Number of potted plants per ledge * Number of ledges

She then received 43 new potted plants from the nursery. 

Total number of potted plants = Number of potted plants she already has + Number of new potted plants

Now, she decides to give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 64 ledges, the number of potted plants she will give away is:

Number of potted plants she will give away = Number of potted plants per ledge given away * Number of ledges
= 6 * 64
= 384

However, she can't give away more potted plants than she has on the ledges. Since she has 9 potted plants on each ledge and she wants to give 6 away, the total number of potted plants she can give away is 6 per ledge. But she has some extra potted plants that are not on the ledges (the 43 new ones).

Number of extra potted plants = Total number of potted plants - Number of potted plants on the ledges
= 619 - 576

Since she can give away 6 potted plants per ledge, the total number of potted plants she will give away is the number of potted plants given away from the ledges (which is 6 * 64 = 384) minus the number of extra potted plants that she can't give away from the ledges (since those extra plants aren't on the ledges). But we know that there are no extra potted plants on the ledges, only the new potted plants are extra. Therefore, she will give away the 6 potted plants from each of the 64 ledges.

1. The city is 45 miles across, and the fog bank covers 9 miles at a time. To find out how many 9-mile sections the fog bank needs to cover, we can divide the total distance by the distance covered in each section:

45 miles (total distance) ÷ 9 miles (distance covered per section) = 5 sections

So, the fog bank needs to cover 5 sections of 9 miles each to reach the entire city.

2. We know it takes 92 minutes to cover each 9-mile section. To find the total time it takes to cover the entire city, we can multiply the time it takes to cover each section by the number of sections:

On Friday, he watched a 2-hour episode and a 30-minute show. We need to convert the 30-minute show to hours, which is 30/60 = 0.5 hours. So, on Friday, he watched 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 hours.

We know that the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 53:24. This means that for every 53 teaspoons of sugar, Emma uses 24 cups of water.

We also know that Emma used a total of 77 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. Let's call the number of teaspoons of sugar ""x"" and the number of cups of water ""y"". We can set up the equation:

x + y = 77

Since the ratio of sugar to water is 53:24, we can set up another equation:

x / y = 53 / 24

We can cross-multiply to get:

24x = 53y

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x by substituting the expression for y from the first equation into the second equation:

24x = 53(77 - x)

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

24x = 4081 - 53x

Adding 53x to both sides, we get:

77x = 4081

Dividing both sides by 77, we get:

x = 53

So Emma used 53 teaspoons of sugar.

**Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3**

There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Out of these, 3 numbers are greater than 3: 4, 5, and 6.

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
P(greater than 3) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes
= 3/6

= 0.5 (or 50%)

**Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row**

To calculate this probability, we need to consider the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and then rolling another even number on the second roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
P(even) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes
= 3/6 (since there are 3 even numbers: 2, 4, and 6)

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
P(two even numbers) = P(even) × P(even)

**Comparing the probabilities**

Now, let's compare the probabilities of the two events:
P(greater than 3) = 0.5 (or 50%)
P(two even numbers) = 0.25 (or 25%)

To find the percentage difference, we can use the following formula:
Percentage difference = ((P(greater than 3) - P(two even numbers)) / P(two even numbers)) × 100

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 1/2 = 0.5, since the outcome of the first roll does not affect the outcome of the second roll.

1. Umar was a pen pal with 9 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 3 of them. So, he is now pen pals with:

9 - 3 = 6 people

2. Each of these 6 people sends him 4 letters a week, and he responds in kind. So, the total number of letters he writes per week is:

6 people x 4 letters/person = 24 letters

3. Each letter is 10 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes per week is:

24 letters x 10 pages/letter = 240 pages

4. Umar can write a page every 6 minutes. To find the total time he spends writing per week, we need to multiply the number of pages by the time it takes to write each page:

240 pages x 6 minutes/page = 1440 minutes

4. We know that 26 artists stayed at the conference. So, the number of engineers left can be found by subtracting the number of artists from the total number of people remaining, which is 92 - 26 = 66 people.

Therefore, there are 66 engineers left at the conference.",66.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
At the beginning, there were 64 artists and 51 engineers, making a total of 64 + 51 = 115 people.
One-fifth of the total number of people left, which is 115 / 5 = 23 people.
We know that 26 artists stayed at the conference, which means 64 - 26 = 38 artists left.
Since a total of 23 people left, and 38 artists left, the number of engineers who left is 23 - 38 is incorrect as engineers cannot be negative, we know that the number of engineers who left must be less than 23. 
Let's assume x engineers left. Then we have x + 38 = 23, which is still incorrect since x cannot be negative.
However, we know that a total of 23 people left, so the number of engineers who left must be 23 - (number of artists who left the conference after 1/5 of the total number of people left).  
The number of people who left is 1/5 of the total, and we know 26 artists stayed, so the number of artists who left is 115 * (1/5) - (51 * (4/5)) = 23 -  (51 * (4/5)), and then we solve for (51 * (4/5)).
Let's think step by step for (51 * (4/5)), which is (51 * 4) / 5 = 204 / 5 = 40.8.
Now we solve for the number of artists who left, which is 23 - 40.8 + 26 = 8.2, this is also incorrect as you cannot have a fraction of an artist, so we know that the number of engineers who left is 23 -  (number of artists who left), the number of artists who left is 64 - 26 = 38, but this is incorrect, we must calculate it another way.
The total number of people who left is 1/5 * 115 = 23.
The total number of people left is made up of 1/5 * 64 artists + 1/5 * 51 engineers = 1/5 * 115 people, which is 64 * (1/5) + 51 * (1/5) = 12.8 + 10.2 = 23. 
So the number of engineers who left is 10.2, and we know that the number of engineers who stayed is 51 - 10.2 = 40.8, this is also incorrect as you cannot have a fraction of an engineer, so we know that we must round the number of engineers who left to the nearest whole number.

Wei bought 46 more bananas at the store and 45 fewer plums than the number of bananas. Find the combined total of the number of plums and bananas Wei has in the house?",465.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Wei has 38 bananas in his house.

Since there are ten times as many plums as bananas, the number of plums is 10 times the number of bananas:

Number of plums = 10 x 38 = 380

So, initially, Wei has 380 plums and 38 bananas.

Now, Wei buys 46 more bananas at the store, so the new total number of bananas is:

38 + 46 = 84

Wei also buys 45 fewer plums than the number of bananas, which means he buys:

84 - 45 = 39 plums

So, the new total number of plums is:

380 + 39 = 419

Now, let's find the combined total of the number of plums and bananas Wei has in the house:

Total plums = 419
Total bananas = 84

Combined total = 419 + 84 = 503

Therefore, the combined total of the number of plums and bananas Wei has in the house is 503.",503.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Wei has a total of 38 bananas in his house initially.

So, the initial number of plums is 10 * 38 = 380.

Wei buys 45 fewer plums than the number of bananas.
Since he bought 46 bananas, he bought 46 - 45 = 1 plum.

So, the total number of plums is 380 + 1 = 381.

The combined total of the number of plums and bananas Wei has in the house is 381 + 84 = 465.

At the souvenir store, fudge was on sale for ""Buy 16 kgs at ¥21 per kg, get 5 kgs 2/3 off."" She scooped up 23 kgs. She also bought a mixed bag of sand dollars for ¥11.5 and 17 postcards that were ¥20.5 each. How much money does Sofia have left?",427.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of fudge**

Sofia bought 23 kgs of fudge, but the sale is for 16 kgs at ¥21 per kg, and then 5 kgs at 2/3 off. Let's calculate the cost of the first 16 kgs:

16 kgs x ¥21 per kg = ¥336

Now, let's calculate the cost of the next 5 kgs at 2/3 off:

2/3 off means the price is reduced by 2/3, so the new price is 1/3 of the original price:
¥21 per kg x 1/3 = ¥7 per kg

Cost of 5 kgs at ¥7 per kg:
5 kgs x ¥7 per kg = ¥35

Now, Sofia bought 23 kgs, so she needs to buy 2 more kgs at the regular price of ¥21 per kg:

2 kgs x ¥21 per kg = ¥42

Total cost of fudge:
¥336 + ¥35 + ¥42 = ¥413

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of sand dollars and postcards**

Cost of sand dollars:
¥11.5

Cost of postcards:
17 postcards x ¥20.5 per postcard = ¥347.5

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost**

Total cost = Cost of fudge + Cost of sand dollars + Cost of postcards
= ¥413 + ¥11.5 + ¥347.5
= ¥772

**Step 4: Calculate the amount of money Sofia has left**

Sofia's parents gave her ¥1200. She spent ¥772.

Amount of money Sofia has left:
¥1200 - ¥772 = ¥428

Therefore, Sofia has ¥428 left.",428.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Sofia starts with ¥1200.

She buys 23 kgs of fudge, but the sale is for 16 kgs at ¥21 per kg, and 5 kgs at 2/3 off. To calculate the cost of the fudge, we need to break it down:
- The first 16 kgs cost ¥21 per kg, so the total cost is 16 * ¥21 = ¥336.
- The next 5 kgs are 2/3 off, which means they are 1/3 of the original price. So, the cost of these 5 kgs is 5 * ¥21 * (1/3) = ¥35.
- The remaining 2 kgs (23 - 16 - 5 = 2) are at the original price of ¥21 per kg, so the total cost is 2 * ¥21 = ¥42.
- The total cost of the fudge is ¥336 + ¥35 + ¥42 = ¥413.

She also buys a mixed bag of sand dollars for ¥11.5.

She buys 17 postcards that are ¥20.5 each, so the total cost is 17 * ¥20.5 = ¥348.5.

The total cost of all the items is ¥413 + ¥11.5 + ¥348.5 = ¥773.

So, the amount of money Sofia has left is ¥1200 - ¥773 = ¥427.

Arash slew 125 × 9 = 1125 giants.

4. Mateo slew 2/3 as many giants as Arash. To find out how many giants Mateo slew, we need to multiply 1125 by 2/3.

1. Liam spent ₣1000 and had 8% of his money left in change. To find out how much he spent, we need to calculate 8% of ₣1000 and subtract it from ₣1000.

8% of ₣1000 = 0.08 x ₣1000 = ₣80

So, Liam spent ₣1000 - ₣80 = ₣920.

2. We know that Liam bought 4 bags of popcorn for 25 cents each. Let's calculate the total cost of the popcorn:

4 bags x 25 cents = 4 x ₣0.25 = ₣1

Since ₣1 is equal to 100 cents, we can convert it to ₣1.

3. Now, let's subtract the cost of the popcorn from the total amount Liam spent:

₣920 - ₣1 = ₣919

This means that Liam spent ₣919 on pretzels.

4. Since each pretzel costs ₣1 (or 100 cents), we can divide the amount Liam spent on pretzels by the cost of one pretzel to find out how many pretzels he bought:

₣919 ÷ ₣1 = 919

So, Liam bought 919 pretzels.

He bought 4 bags of popcorn for 25 cents each.

How much longer does Tariq take to swim 8 miles on a hot day than a cold day?,304.0,"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine how long Tariq takes to swim a mile on a hot day.
When the water is warm, Tariq swims a mile in 6 minutes more than thrice as long as when the water is cold. Since he swims a mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold, thrice as long would be 3 * 16 = 48 minutes. Adding 6 more minutes, we get:
48 + 6 = 54 minutes

Step 2: Calculate how long Tariq takes to swim 8 miles on a hot day.
Since it takes Tariq 54 minutes to swim a mile on a hot day, it will take him:
54 * 8 = 432 minutes

Step 3: Calculate how long Tariq takes to swim 8 miles on a cold day.
Since it takes Tariq 16 minutes to swim a mile on a cold day, it will take him:
16 * 8 = 128 minutes

Step 4: Find the difference in time between swimming 8 miles on a hot day and a cold day.
To find the difference, subtract the time it takes to swim on a cold day from the time it takes to swim on a hot day:
432 - 128 = 304 minutes

Therefore, Tariq takes 304 minutes longer to swim 8 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.",8.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

When the water is cold, Tariq swims a mile in 16 minutes.

Since we are comparing the time taken to swim 8 miles, we need to multiply the time taken to swim 1 mile by 8.
Time taken to swim 8 miles in cold water is 8 * 16 = 128 minutes.
Time taken to swim 8 miles in warm water is 8 * 54 = 432 minutes.

We know that Mia operates the cash register exactly eight times as fast as Gabrielle. This means that if Gabrielle processes x customers, Mia processes 8x customers.

We are given that Gabrielle processes 85 customers daily. Since Mia is eight times as fast, Mia processes 8 x 85 = 680 customers daily.

To find the total daily production for both Mia and Gabrielle, we add the number of customers they process:

Daily production = Gabrielle's daily production + Mia's daily production

Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 2 weeks.",20.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of occupied rooms**

The care facility has a capacity of 1900 rooms, and 2/5 of them are occupied. To find the number of occupied rooms, we'll multiply the capacity by 2/5:

Occupied rooms = 1900 x 2/5
= 1900 x 0.4
= 760 rooms

**Step 2: Calculate the number of unoccupied rooms initially**

To find the number of unoccupied rooms initially, we'll subtract the number of occupied rooms from the total capacity:

Unoccupied rooms initially = Total capacity - Occupied rooms
= 1900 - 760
= 1140 rooms

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks**

The care facility admits 80 patients per day. To find the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks, we'll multiply the daily admission by the number of days in 2 weeks (14 days):

Total patients admitted = 80 patients/day x 14 days
= 1120 patients

**Step 4: Calculate the number of unoccupied rooms after 2 weeks**

Since each patient occupies one room, we'll subtract the total number of patients admitted from the initial number of unoccupied rooms:

Unoccupied rooms after 2 weeks = Unoccupied rooms initially - Total patients admitted
= 1140 - 1120
= 20 rooms

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 2 weeks is 20 rooms.",20.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many rooms are occupied. Since 2/5 of the rooms are occupied, we multiply 1900 by 2/5.
So, the number of occupied rooms is 1900 * (2/5) = 760.

Now, the number of unoccupied rooms is the total number of rooms minus the occupied rooms. 
So, the initial number of unoccupied rooms is 1900 - 760 = 1140.

Next, we need to find out how many patients are admitted in 2 weeks. Since 80 patients are admitted each day, we multiply 80 by 14 (the number of days in 2 weeks).
So, the total number of patients admitted is 80 * 14 = 1120.

Since each patient occupies one room, the number of unoccupied rooms after 2 weeks is the initial number of unoccupied rooms minus the number of patients admitted.

**Friday:**

* Brownies: 29 boxes
* Kiwi pies: 12 fewer boxes than on Saturday, so we don't know this number yet. Let's call it x.

**Saturday:**

* Brownies: 11 more boxes than on Friday, so 29 + 11 = 40 boxes

Kimia's flower bed is 180 feet long.
She needs to leave 15 feet between every plant, and each plant is 3 feet wide.
So, the total space taken up by each plant is 3 + 15 = 18 feet.
To find out how many plants Kimia can fit in her flower bed, we need to divide the total length of the flower bed by the space taken up by each plant: 180 / 18 = 10.

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,Fatima can peel 10 clams a minute and saute 30 clams in 7 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 90 clams?,30.0,"To find out how long it will take Fatima to peel and saute 90 clams, we need to break down the problem into two parts: peeling and sauteing.

1. Peeling:
Fatima can peel 10 clams per minute. To peel 90 clams, it will take:
90 clams / 10 clams per minute = 9 minutes

2. Sauteing:
Fatima can saute 30 clams in 7 minutes. To saute 90 clams, we need to find out how many sets of 30 clams she needs to saute. Divide 90 by 30:
90 clams / 30 clams = 3 sets
Since each set takes 7 minutes to saute, the total time for sauteing is:
3 sets * 7 minutes per set = 21 minutes

Now, we add the peeling time and sauteing time to find the total time:
9 minutes (peeling) + 21 minutes (sauteing) = 30 minutes

Therefore, it will take Fatima 30 minutes to peel and saute 90 clams.",90.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate how many minutes it takes Fatima to peel 90 clams. She can peel 10 clams per minute.
So, the time it takes to peel 90 clams is 90 / 10 = 9 minutes.

Next, let's calculate how many minutes it takes Fatima to saute 90 clams. She can saute 30 clams in 7 minutes.
To find out how many minutes it takes to saute 90 clams, we need to divide 90 by 30 to find out how many groups of 30 clams there are, and then multiply by 7.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of classes Hiroshi takes in a week**

Hiroshi has 7 periods in a day, and he takes 2 extra classes. So, the total number of classes he takes in a day is:
7 (normal classes) + 2 (extra classes) = 9 classes per day

Since he goes to class for 4 days a week, the total number of classes he takes in a week is:
9 classes per day × 4 days per week = 36 classes per week

**Step 2: Calculate the total minutes Hiroshi spends in class per week**

Each class is 35 minutes long, so the total minutes he spends in class per week is:
36 classes per week × 35 minutes per class = 1260 minutes per week

**Step 3: Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday**

Hiroshi spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. To calculate this, we need to find three-sixths of 1260 minutes:

**Step 4: Calculate the total minutes Hiroshi spends learning per week**

The total minutes Hiroshi spends learning per week is the sum of the time he spends in class and the extra learning time:
1260 minutes (in class) + 1260 minutes (extra learning time) = 2520 minutes per week

**Step 5: Convert the total minutes to hours**

2. Let's denote Emma's speed on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since she walks at four times the speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 4x miles per minute.

3. We know that time = distance / speed. Emma walks 11 miles on the beach at a speed of x miles per minute, and it takes her 66 minutes. We can set up the equation:

   11 = 66x
   
   Now, we can solve for x:
   
   x = 11 / 66
   
   x = 1/6 miles per minute

4. Now that we know Emma's speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 4x = 4 * (1/6) = 2/3 miles per minute.

5. Emma walks 16 miles on the sidewalk at a speed of 2/3 miles per minute. We can find the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk:

   Time = Distance / Speed
   
   Time = 16 / (2/3)
   
   Time = 16 * 3/2
   
   Time = 24 minutes

6. Now, we know it takes Emma 66 minutes to walk on the beach and 24 minutes to walk on the sidewalk. The total time it takes her to complete the entire 27-mile walk is:

   Total time = 66 + 24
   
   Total time = 90 minutes

Therefore, it takes Emma 90 minutes to complete the entire 27-mile walk.",27.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Emma walks 11 miles on the beach and 16 miles on the sidewalk.
She walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.
Let's first find the rate of speed on the beach. We know she spends 66 minutes walking 11 miles on the beach.
So, her rate of speed on the beach is 11 miles / 66 minutes = 1 mile / 6 minutes.
Since she walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her rate of speed on the sidewalk is 4 * (1 mile / 6 minutes) = 1 mile / 1.5 minutes.
Now, let's find the time it takes for her to walk 16 miles on the sidewalk. 
Time = Distance / Rate = 16 miles / (1 mile / 1.5 minutes) = 16 * 1.5 minutes = 24 minutes.
So, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire 27-mile walk is the time spent on the beach (66 minutes) plus the time spent on the sidewalk (24 minutes).
Total time = 66 minutes + 24 minutes = 90 minutes.

In the next 96 days, Winnie eats 5 eggs a day:
5 eggs/day x 96 days = 480 eggs

Total number of eggs Winnie will need:
240 eggs + 480 eggs = 720 eggs

Then, we need to find out how many eggs Winnie eats in 96 days at a rate of 5 eggs per day.
So, the total number of eggs eaten in 96 days is 96 * 5 = 480 eggs.

Now, we need to find the total number of eggs eaten in 156 days.
So, the total number of eggs eaten is 240 + 480 = 720 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.

1. Tariq hid 9 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen is 12 eggs, we can calculate the total number of eggs:
9 dozen = 9 * 12 = 108 eggs

2. Noah finds 5 eggs.

3. Emma finds four times as many as Noah:

Olivia's eggs = 20 - 2 = 18 eggs

5. Alejandro finds 1/2 as many as Olivia:
Alejandro's eggs = 18 / 2 = 9 eggs

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs found by the children:

Tariq hid 9 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 9 dozen eggs is 9 * 12 = 108 eggs.

Noah finds 5 eggs.

Emma finds four times as many as Noah, so she finds 4 * 5 = 20 eggs.

Olivia finds 2 less than Emma, so she finds 20 - 2 = 18 eggs.

Alejandro finds 1/2 as many as Olivia, so he finds 18 / 2 = 9 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 20 + 18 + 9 = 52 eggs.

Since Tariq hid 108 eggs and 52 eggs were found, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 108 - 52 = 56 eggs.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the first 3 complexes**

Each of the first 3 complexes has 300 apartments, so the total number of apartments in these 3 complexes is:

300 + 300 + 300 = 900 apartments

**Step 2: Calculate the number of apartments in the last complex**

The last complex is 35% bigger than the other 3 combined. To calculate the number of apartments in the last complex, we need to find 35% of 900 and add it to 900:

35% of 900 = 0.35 x 900 = 315
900 + 315 = 1215 apartments

Ali collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is:

3 collections/week x 2115 apartments = 6345 collections/week

Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the weight of the first, second, and last trouts, but we don't know the weight of the third and fourth trouts. Since we don't have that information, we'll assume the problem is asking us to calculate the total weight of the trouts Gabriel caught, and then we'll use that to find the total earnings.

The weights of the trouts are:
First trout: 43 kg
Second trout: 45 kg
Last trout (which is the fifth trout): 28 kg

We don't know the weights of the third and fourth trouts, so we'll ignore them for now.

2. Let's add up the weights of the trouts we know:
43 kg + 45 kg + 28 kg = 116 kg

Since Gabriel caught 5 trouts, we'll assume the total weight of the trouts is the sum of the weights of all 5 trouts. However, we only know the weights of 3 trouts. To find the total weight, we'll need to make an assumption. Let's assume the weights of the third and fourth trouts are unknown, but we'll use the average weight of the trouts we know to estimate their weights.

The average weight of the trouts we know is:
(43 kg + 45 kg + 28 kg) / 3 = 116 kg / 3 = 38.67 kg

Let's assume the weights of the third and fourth trouts are approximately equal to the average weight:
Third trout: 38.67 kg
Fourth trout: 38.67 kg

Now, let's add up the weights of all 5 trouts:
43 kg + 45 kg + 38.67 kg + 38.67 kg + 28 kg = 194 kg

3. Now that we have the total weight of the trouts, we can multiply it by the price per kilogram to find the total earnings:

A: Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the total weight of the trouts. We know the weight of three trouts and their total number.
The weight of the first trout is 43 kg.
The weight of the second trout is 45 kg.

Since we do not know the weight of the remaining two trouts, we can denote them as x.
So, the total weight of the trouts caught will be the weight of the first trout plus the weight of the second trout plus the weight of the last trout plus the weight of the remaining two trouts.

The total weight of the trouts with given weights is 43 + 45 + 28 = 116.
The average weight of the three trouts is 116/3 = 38.67 kg.

How much would a 64-minute call cost?",24.0,"To find the total cost of the 64-minute call, we need to calculate the cost for the first 44 minutes and the cost for the remaining 20 minutes, and then add them together.

1. Cost for the first 44 minutes:
   Cost per minute = $0.5
   Number of minutes = 44
   Cost = Cost per minute * Number of minutes
   Cost = $0.5 * 44
   Cost = $22

2. Cost for the remaining 20 minutes:
   Number of minutes = 64 - 44 = 20
   Cost per minute = $0.1
   Cost = Cost per minute * Number of minutes
   Cost = $0.1 * 20
   Cost = $2

3. Total cost:
   Total cost = Cost for the first 44 minutes + Cost for the remaining 20 minutes

   Total cost = $24

The total cost of the 64-minute call is $24.",24.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

For the first 44 minutes, the cost is $0.5 per minute.
So, the cost for the first 44 minutes is 44 * $0.5 = $22.

After 44 minutes, the price drops to $0.1 per minute.
The remaining time is 64 - 44 = 20 minutes.
So, the cost for the remaining 20 minutes is 20 * $0.1 = $2.

The total cost is the sum of the cost for the first 44 minutes and the cost for the remaining 20 minutes.
So, the total cost is $22 + $2 = $24.

If they work 11 hours each day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?",50.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time spent cleaning rooms**

The cleaner has to clean 110 rooms, and it takes 15 minutes per room. To find the total time spent cleaning rooms, we multiply the number of rooms by the time per room:

110 rooms × 15 minutes/room = 1650 minutes

**Step 2: Convert the total time to hours**

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we'll convert the total time from minutes to hours:

1650 minutes ÷ 60 = 27.5 hours

**Step 3: Calculate the total time available to clean**

The cleaner has 5 days to get the job done, and they work 11 hours each day. To find the total time available to clean, we multiply the number of days by the hours worked per day:

5 days × 11 hours/day = 55 hours

**Step 4: Calculate the percentage of time spent cleaning rooms**

Now, we'll divide the total time spent cleaning rooms (27.5 hours) by the total time available to clean (55 hours), and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage:

(27.5 hours ÷ 55 hours) × 100 = 50%

Therefore, on average, the cleaner spends 50% of their day cleaning rooms.",50.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The cleaner has to clean 110 rooms in total.
They have 5 days to get it done, so they need to clean 110 / 5 = 22 rooms per day.
It takes them 15 minutes per room, so the total time spent cleaning per day is 22 * 15 = 330 minutes.
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total time spent cleaning per day is 330 / 60 = 5.5 hours.
They work 11 hours each day, so the percentage of their day spent cleaning rooms is (5.5 / 11) * 100 = 50%.

How many marbles did Ali end up with?",64.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Ali had 96 marbles.

He dropped three-sixths of them, which is equivalent to 3/6 = 1/2 of the marbles. To find the number of marbles he dropped, we can multiply 96 by 1/2:

96 x 1/2 = 48

So, Ali dropped 48 marbles.

After dropping 48 marbles, he was left with:

96 - 48 = 48

Then, he picked up 18 marbles, but 2 of them were actually beads, so he got rid of them. This means he actually picked up 18 - 2 = 16 marbles.

Now, let's add the marbles he picked up to the marbles he had left:

48 + 16 = 64

Therefore, Ali ended up with 64 marbles.",64.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Ali starts with 96 marbles.
He drops three-sixths of them, which is (3/6) * 96 = 48 marbles.
So, the number of marbles left in the bag is 96 - 48 = 48 marbles.
He picks up 18 marbles from the dropped ones.
Now, he has 48 (from the bag) + 18 (picked up) = 66 marbles.
However, 2 of them are beads, not marbles, so he gets rid of them.
So, the number of marbles left is 66 - 2 = 64.

**Step 1: First 22 seconds**
30 kernels pop in the first 22 seconds.

**Step 2: Next 22 seconds**
2 times the initial amount pop in the next 22 seconds, so:
2 x 30 = 60 kernels pop in the next 22 seconds.

60 / 4 = 15 kernels pop from the residual heat.

**Step 6: Total number of kernels**
