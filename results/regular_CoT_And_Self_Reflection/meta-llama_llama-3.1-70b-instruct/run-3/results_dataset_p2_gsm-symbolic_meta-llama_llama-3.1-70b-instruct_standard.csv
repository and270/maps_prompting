gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"Sophia went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, and 60 mini cheesecakes. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of donuts**

Sophia bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen. To find the cost of 60 donuts, we need to divide 60 by 12 (since there are 12 donuts in a dozen) and multiply by the cost per dozen.

60 donuts ÷ 12 = 5 dozen
Cost of donuts = 5 dozen × $19 per dozen = $95

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of mini cupcakes**

Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen. To find the cost of 60 mini cupcakes, we need to divide 60 by 12 (since there are 12 cupcakes in a dozen) and multiply by the cost per dozen.

60 cupcakes ÷ 12 = 5 dozen
Cost of cupcakes = 5 dozen × $33 per dozen = $165

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of donuts and cupcakes**

Total cost of donuts and cupcakes = $95 + $165 = $260

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of all pastries before discount**

We know that Sophia paid a total of $1500 after a 20% discount. To find the total cost before discount, we need to divide $1500 by 0.8 (since 20% discount means 80% of the original price).

Total cost before discount = $1500 ÷ 0.8 = $1875

**Step 5: Calculate the cost of mini cheesecakes**

Now, we can find the cost of mini cheesecakes by subtracting the total cost of donuts and cupcakes from the total cost before discount.

Cost of mini cheesecakes = Total cost before discount - Total cost of donuts and cupcakes
= $1875 - $260
= $1615

Since Sophia bought 60 mini cheesecakes, we can divide the cost by 5 (since there are 12 cheesecakes in a dozen, and 60 ÷ 12 = 5 dozen).

Cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen = $1615 ÷ 5 = $323 per dozen

Therefore, the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is $323.",323.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts. Sophia bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen. Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, she bought 60 / 12 = 5 dozen donuts. The total cost of the donuts is 5 * $19 = $95.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen. Since there are 12 mini cupcakes in a dozen, she bought 60 / 12 = 5 dozen mini cupcakes. The total cost of the mini cupcakes is 5 * $33 = $165.

The total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes is $95 + $165 = $260.

Since Sophia paid a total of $1500 after a 20% discount, the original price before the discount was $1500 / 0.8 = $1875.

The cost of the mini cheesecakes is the difference between the original price and the cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes. So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is $1875 - $260 = $1615.

Since Sophia bought 60 mini cheesecakes, the number of dozens is 60 / 12 = 5 dozen. The cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen is $1615 / 5 = $323.

The answer is $323.",323.0,1,,323.0,1
gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving. A 300 grams bag has 6 servings. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?",350.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Hiroshi and Tara, and then determine how many calories they have already consumed and how many more they can consume. We will then calculate how many grams of popcorn they can eat and find the difference.

**Step 1: Calculate daily calorie target**

Hiroshi's daily calorie target = 15 calories/lb x 220 lbs = 3300 calories
Tara's daily calorie target = 15 calories/lb x 140 lbs = 2100 calories

**Step 2: Calculate remaining calories for the day**

Hiroshi's remaining calories = 3300 - 1100 (consumed) + 200 (burned) = 2400 calories
Tara's remaining calories = 2100 - 900 (consumed) - 200 (ice cream) = 1000 calories

**Step 3: Calculate calories per serving of popcorn**

Calories per serving of popcorn = 200 calories (given)

**Step 4: Calculate number of servings of popcorn each person can eat**

Hiroshi's servings = 2400 calories / 200 calories/serving = 12 servings
Tara's servings = 1000 calories / 200 calories/serving = 5 servings

**Step 5: Calculate grams of popcorn each person can eat**

Since there are 6 servings in a 300g bag, we can calculate the grams per serving:
300g / 6 servings = 50g/serving

Hiroshi's grams = 12 servings x 50g/serving = 600g
Tara's grams = 5 servings x 50g/serving = 250g

**Step 6: Calculate the difference in grams of popcorn**

Difference = Hiroshi's grams - Tara's grams = 600g - 250g = 350g

Therefore, Hiroshi needs to consume 350g more of popcorn than Tara.",350.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories Hiroshi and Tara can consume in a day. 
Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and his daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight.
So, his daily calorie target is 220 * 15 = 3300 calories.
He has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise.
So, the number of calories he can still consume is 3300 - 1100 + 200 = 2400 calories.

Tara weighs 140 lbs, and her daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight.
So, her daily calorie target is 140 * 15 = 2100 calories.
She has already consumed 900 calories in food and 200 calories in ice cream.
So, the number of calories she can still consume is 2100 - 900 - 200 = 1000 calories.

Now, we need to find out how many calories are in the popcorn bag.
The bag has 6 servings, and each serving has 200 calories.
So, the total number of calories in the bag is 6 * 200 = 1200 calories.

Since the bag weighs 300 grams, we can find out how many calories are in 1 gram of popcorn.
The number of calories per gram is 1200 / 300 = 4 calories per gram.

Now, we can find out how many grams of popcorn Hiroshi and Tara can consume.
Hiroshi can consume 2400 calories, and each gram of popcorn has 4 calories.
So, the number of grams of popcorn he can consume is 2400 / 4 = 600 grams.

Tara can consume 1000 calories, and each gram of popcorn has 4 calories.
So, the number of grams of popcorn she can consume is 1000 / 4 = 250 grams.

Finally, we can find out how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara.
The difference is 600 - 250 = 350 grams.

Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Daphne remain with?",335.0,"To find the total number of potted plants Daphne will remain with, we need to calculate the total number of plants she has and subtract the number of plants she will give away. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Calculate the total number of potted plants Daphne already had on her window ledges:
   Number of window ledges = 56
   Number of plants per ledge = 8
   Total plants on ledges = 56 * 8 = 448

2. Calculate the total number of new plants Daphne received or purchased:
   Plants received two days ago = 23
   Plants purchased yesterday at a discount = 200
   Total new plants = 23 + 200 = 223

3. Calculate the total number of plants Daphne has:

   Total plants = 448 + 223 = 671

4. Calculate the number of plants Daphne will give away:
   Number of plants given away per ledge = 6
   Total plants given away = 56 * 6 = 336

5. Calculate the total number of plants Daphne will remain with:

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 60 minutes to cover every 4 miles of the city. However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,"To find the time it takes for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city, we need to consider the wind speed change. 

First, we find the initial fog bank speed. It takes 60 minutes to cover 4 miles, so the initial speed is 4 miles / 60 minutes = 1/15 miles per minute.

We know that the wind speed will be halved in one hour, which is 60 minutes. However, we're only interested in the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city. The city is 80 miles across, so 1/4 of the city is 80 miles / 4 = 20 miles.

Since the wind speed change occurs after 60 minutes, and we don't know if the fog bank will cover 20 miles in less than 60 minutes, we'll calculate the time it takes to cover 20 miles at the initial speed. 

At 1/15 miles per minute, the time it takes to cover 20 miles is 20 miles / (1/15 miles/minute) = 20 * 15 minutes = 300 minutes.

However, the wind speed is halved after 60 minutes. So, in the first 60 minutes, the fog bank covers 4 miles (as given). Now, we need to find the remaining distance to cover 1/4 of the city, which is 20 miles - 4 miles = 16 miles.

After the wind speed is halved, the new speed will be (1/15 miles/minute) / 2 = 1/30 miles per minute. 

The time it takes to cover the remaining 16 miles at this new speed is 16 miles / (1/30 miles/minute) = 16 * 30 minutes = 480 minutes.

Adding the initial 60 minutes and the time it takes to cover the remaining distance at the new speed, we get 60 minutes + 480 minutes. However, this is the time it takes to cover the entire 20 miles at the new speed after the first 60 minutes, not the time it takes to cover 16 miles. We can set up a proportion to solve for the time it takes to cover 16 miles:

(4 miles / 60 minutes) = (16 miles / x minutes) 

x = (16 miles * 60 minutes) / 4 miles 
x = 240 minutes 

Since we know it takes 60 minutes to cover the first 4 miles, we can add 60 minutes + 240 minutes to get the total time it would take to cover 20 miles at the initial speed and then at the new speed. However, we only need 20 - 4 = 16 miles, and we know that at the initial speed it would have taken 60 minutes to cover 4 miles and at the new speed, it will take 240 minutes to cover 16 miles. However, we want the time it takes to cover 16 miles at the new speed after the first 60 minutes. Since it would take 240 minutes to cover 16 miles at the new speed, we can set up a proportion to solve for the time it takes to cover 16 miles at the new speed after the first 60 minutes. Since the first 4 miles took 60 minutes, it would take x minutes to cover 16 miles at the new speed, after the first 60 minutes.

Since it would take 480 minutes - 60 minutes = 420 minutes to cover 20 - 4 = 16 miles at the new speed. We know that the first 4 miles took 60 minutes. So we can set up the proportion:

(60 minutes / 4 miles) = (420 minutes / 20 miles) 

However, we want to find the time it takes to cover 16 miles at the new speed after the first 60 minutes. We know that it would take 420 minutes to cover 20 miles at the new speed after the first 60 minutes. 420 minutes - 60 minutes = 360 minutes to cover 16 miles at the new speed. To find the time it takes to cover 16 miles at the new speed after the first 60 minutes, we can set up the proportion:

(60 minutes / 4 miles) = (360 minutes / 16 miles) 

360 minutes = (60 minutes * 16 miles) / 4 miles 

360 minutes = (60 minutes * 16) / 4

Since it would take 60 minutes to cover the first 4 miles, and it would take 360 minutes to cover 16 miles at the new speed after the first 60 minutes.

360 minutes - 120 minutes = 240 minutes 

240 minutes + 60 minutes = 300 minutes",300.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes.
We need to find out how many minutes it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, which is 1/4 of 80 miles.
1/4 of 80 miles is 80 / 4 = 20 miles.
Since the fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes it takes to cover 20 miles.
To do this, we can multiply the time it takes to cover 4 miles by 5, since 20 miles is 5 times 4 miles.
So, the time it takes to cover 20 miles is 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.
However, we are told that the wind speed will be halved in one hour, which means the fog bank will move at half the speed after 60 minutes.
Since we are looking for the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, which is 20 miles, and the fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, it will cover 4 miles in the first 60 minutes.
After that, the wind speed will be halved, and it will take twice as long to cover the remaining 16 miles.
The time it takes to cover the remaining 16 miles is 60 * 4 = 240 minutes.
So, the total time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city is 60 + 240 = 300 minutes.
However, we can simplify this problem by considering the fact that the fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, and we need to find the time it takes to cover 20 miles.
Since the wind speed is halved after 60 minutes, we can assume that the fog bank will cover half the distance in the first 60 minutes, and the remaining half in the next 120 minutes (twice the time).
So, the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city is 60 + 120 = 180 minutes.
The answer is 180.",180.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

The city is 80 miles across, and we want to find out how long it will take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city. 
1/4 of 80 miles is 80 / 4 = 20 miles.

It takes 60 minutes for the fog bank to cover 4 miles of the city, 
so the speed of the fog bank is 4 miles / 60 minutes = 1/15 miles per minute.

However, the wind speed will be halved in one hour, which means the speed of the fog bank will be halved as well. 
Since the speed is halved, the new speed will be (1/15 miles/minute) / 2 = 1/30 miles/minute.

Since the fog bank's speed is halved, we must also consider the time it takes for the wind speed to be halved. 
It takes 1 hour, or 60 minutes, for the wind speed to be halved. 
In this time, the fog bank will cover 1/15 miles/minute * 60 minutes = 4 miles. 
Now, 20 - 4 = 16 miles are left to be covered at the new speed of 1/30 miles/minute.

The time it will take to cover the remaining 16 miles is 16 miles / (1/30 miles/minute) = 480 minutes.

However, we must add the initial 60 minutes it took for the wind speed to be halved to the time it will take to cover the remaining 16 miles. 
So, the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city is 60 + 480 = 540 minutes, but the question is asking how long it will take after the wind speed has been halved for the remaining distance. 
Since it already took 60 minutes to cover 4 miles, we can instead calculate the time it will take to cover 20 miles at the old speed of 1/15 miles/minute. 
20 miles / (1/15 miles/minute) = 300 minutes.

However, this is not correct because the wind speed will be halved. 
Since it takes 60 minutes for the wind speed to be halved, 
the correct answer is the sum of the time it will take to cover 4 miles at the old speed and the time it will take to cover 16 miles at the new speed. 
However, we can also consider that the wind speed will be halved in 60 minutes, 
so we calculate the time it will take to cover 20 miles at the new speed of 1/30 miles/minute.
20 miles / (1/30 miles/minute) = 600 minutes, 
but this is the time it will take to cover 20 miles at the new speed, 
and the wind speed will be halved after 60 minutes of traveling at the old speed of 1/15 miles/minute.

The total time it took to cover the 20 miles is thus 60 minutes + the time it took to cover 16 miles at the new speed. 
We already know the time it will take to cover 20 miles at the new speed, which is 600 minutes. 
However, 4 miles are covered in the first 60 minutes. 
So, we subtract the time it would take to cover 4 miles at the new speed from 600 minutes. 
It will take 4 miles / (1/30 miles/minute) = 120 minutes to cover 4 miles at the new speed. 
So we subtract 120 minutes from the total time it will take to cover 20 miles at the new speed, 
and we add the initial 60 minutes, 
which is not correct because we must subtract 120 minutes from the total time it will take to cover 20 miles at the new speed, 
and then we must also add the initial 60 minutes that it took for the wind speed to be halved. 
However, this is incorrect because we can just consider the total time it will take to cover 20 miles at the new speed of 1/30 miles/minute 
minus the time it will take to cover 4 miles at the new speed and add the initial 60 minutes that it took for the wind speed to be halved.

600 - 120 = 480 minutes. 
We must add the initial 60 minutes that it took for the wind speed to be halved. 
However, we can calculate the time it will take to cover the remaining 16 miles at the new speed.

On Thursday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. On Friday, he finished homework early and watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 2-hour episodes. On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?",6.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total hours of TV watched on Tuesday and Wednesday**
Santiago watched 4-hour episodes on both Tuesday and Wednesday, so the total hours watched on these two days is:
4 hours/day × 2 days = 8 hours

**Step 2: Calculate the total hours of TV watched on Friday**
Santiago watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show on Friday. Convert the 45-minute show to hours:
45 minutes ÷ 60 = 0.75 hours
Total hours watched on Friday = 3 hours + 0.75 hours = 3.75 hours

**Step 3: Calculate the total hours of TV watched on Saturday**
Santiago watched three 2-hour episodes on Saturday:
3 episodes × 2 hours/episode = 6 hours

**Step 4: Calculate the total hours of TV watched on Sunday**
Santiago watched three 15-minute episodes on Sunday. Convert the 15-minute episodes to hours:
3 episodes × 15 minutes/episode = 45 minutes
45 minutes ÷ 60 = 0.75 hours

**Step 5: Calculate the total hours of TV watched on all days except Thursday**
Add up the hours watched on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:
8 hours + 3.75 hours + 6 hours + 0.75 hours = 18.5 hours

**Step 6: Calculate the hours of TV watched on Thursday**
Since Santiago watched a total of 20 hours of TV, subtract the hours watched on all other days from the total:
20 hours - 18.5 hours = 1.5 hours

**Step 7: Calculate the number of 15-minute episodes watched on Thursday**
Since each episode is 15 minutes, convert the hours watched on Thursday to minutes:
1.5 hours × 60 = 90 minutes
Now, divide the total minutes by the length of each episode:
90 minutes ÷ 15 minutes/episode = 6 episodes

Therefore, Santiago watched **6** 15-minute episodes on Thursday.",15.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total hours of TV Santiago watched on Tuesday and Wednesday.
He watched 4-hour episodes each night, so the total hours for these two days is 4 + 4 = 8 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total hours of TV Santiago watched on Friday.
He watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. We need to convert the 45-minute show to hours, which is 45 / 60 = 0.75 hours.
So, the total hours for Friday is 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total hours of TV Santiago watched on Saturday.
He watched three 2-hour episodes, so the total hours for Saturday is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

We also know that Santiago watched three 15-minute episodes on Sunday, which is equal to 3 * 15 / 60 = 0.75 hours.

Now, let's add up the total hours of TV Santiago watched on all days except Thursday:
8 hours (Tuesday and Wednesday) + 3.75 hours (Friday) + 6 hours (Saturday) + 0.75 hours (Sunday) = 18.5 hours.

We know that Santiago watched a total of 20 hours of TV, so the number of hours he watched on Thursday is 20 - 18.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Thursday is 15 minutes, which is equal to 0.25 hours, the number of episodes he watched on Thursday is 1.5 / 0.25 = 6.

She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Nia uses teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 54:27. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both numbers by 9, which gives us a ratio of 6:3.

We also know that Nia uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, which means she uses 1 tablespoon of milk for every cup of water.

We also know that Nia uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar.

Let's say Nia uses x teaspoons of sugar. Then, she uses x/6 cups of water (since the ratio of sugar to water is 6:3), x/8 tablespoons of milk (since she uses 1 tablespoon of milk for every cup of water), and 2x tablespoons of heavy cream.

We know that the total amount of sugar, water, cream, and milk is 240. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x/6 + 2x + x/8 = 240

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 24 (which is the least common multiple of 6 and 8):

24x + 4x + 48x + 3x = 5760

Combine like terms:

79x = 5760

Divide both sides by 79:

x = 72

So, Nia used 72 teaspoons of sugar.",72.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Nia uses teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 54:27. 
This can be simplified to a ratio of 2:1 by dividing both numbers by 27 and then by 2.

She uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar.
So, the ratio of sugar to heavy cream is 1:2.

She uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water. 
Since the ratio of water to sugar is 1:2, the ratio of milk to sugar is 8:16, which can be simplified to 1:2 by dividing both numbers by 8. 
So, the ratio of sugar to milk is 1:1.

Now, let's combine all the ratios. 
The ratio of sugar to water to cream to milk is 2:1:4:2.

This can be further simplified to a ratio of 2:1:4:2, or 1:0.5:2:1.

We know that the total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is 240.
Let the total number of teaspoons of sugar be 1x, cups of water be 0.5x, tablespoons of cream be 2x, and tablespoons of milk be x.

Then, 1x + 0.5x + 2x + x = 240.
Combine the x terms, 4.5x = 240.

Divide both sides by 4.5 to solve for x, x = 240 / 4.5.
x = 53.33.

Since the number of teaspoons of sugar is 1x, she used 1 * 53.33 * 2 = 106.66 teaspoons of sugar, however, this would be for 0.5x being the cups of water in terms of teaspoons so multiply 1x by 2 and use 1x for teaspoons of sugar for cups of water.

Additionally, she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar, which means the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to tablespoons of cream is 1:2.

Let's say the number of teaspoons of sugar is x. Then, the number of cups of water is x/2 (since the ratio is 6:3), the number of tablespoons of milk is x/2 (since the ratio is 1:1), and the number of tablespoons of cream is 2x.

The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is 240. We can set up an equation based on this:

x + x/2 + 2x + x/2 = 240

In the span of two years, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?",1764.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of bananas per square yard**

We know that there are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard. To find the number of bananas per square yard, we'll multiply 36 by 5/4 (since four-fifths is the same as 4/5, and we want to find the number of bananas per 1 square yard).

36 bananas / (4/5) square yard = 36 × 5/4 = 45 bananas per square yard

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of bananas harvested in 2 years**

Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field, and he can harvest bananas every 4 months. In 2 years, there are 6 harvests (since 2 years × 12 months/year ÷ 4 months/harvest = 6 harvests).

Total bananas harvested in 2 years = 10 square yards × 45 bananas/square yard × 6 harvests = 2700 bananas

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of apricots harvested in 2 years**

Ravi has 13 square yards of apricot field, and he can harvest apricots every 4 months. In 2 years, there are 6 harvests.

Total apricots harvested in 2 years = 13 square yards × 12 apricots/square yard × 6 harvests = 936 apricots

**Step 4: Find the difference between the number of bananas and apricots harvested**

To find the difference, we'll subtract the number of apricots harvested from the number of bananas harvested.

Difference = Total bananas harvested - Total apricots harvested = 2700 - 936 = 1764

So, the number of bananas per square yard is 36 * (5/4) = 45 bananas per square yard.
Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field, so the total number of bananas he can harvest is 10 * 45 = 450 bananas.
Since Ravi can harvest bananas every 4 months, in 2 years (24 months), he can harvest bananas 24 / 4 = 6 times.
So, the total number of bananas Ravi can harvest in 2 years is 450 * 6 = 2700 bananas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apricots Ravi can harvest from his apricot field.
Ravi owns a 13-square yard apricot field that produces 12 apricots per square yard.
So, the total number of apricots he can harvest is 13 * 12 = 156 apricots.
Since Ravi can harvest apricots every 4 months, in 2 years (24 months), he can harvest apricots 24 / 4 = 6 times.
So, the total number of apricots Ravi can harvest in 2 years is 156 * 6 = 936 apricots.

He bought 12 folders which cost $4.75 each, 8 erasers which cost $14.5 each, and a ream of bond paper which cost $11. He also bought 7 pencils which cost $8 each. Arjun can either pay a one-time $20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases, or not become a member and receive only a 5% discount. What is the least amount Arjun can spend on everything?",212.0,"To find the least amount Arjun can spend, we'll calculate the total cost of the items, and then compare the two options: becoming a member and not becoming a member.

1. Calculate the total cost of the items:

   - 12 folders * $4.75 = $57
   - 8 erasers * $14.50 = $116
   - 1 ream of bond paper * $11 = $11
   - 7 pencils * $8 = $56

   Total cost = $57 + $116 + $11 + $56 = $240

2. Option 1: Becoming a member
   - One-time fee: $20
   - Total cost after 20% discount: 
     - Discount amount = 20% of $240 = 0.20 * $240 = $48
     - Total cost after discount = $240 - $48 = $192
   - Total amount Arjun needs to pay = $192 (discounted cost) + $20 (one-time fee) = $212

3. Option 2: Not becoming a member
   - Total cost after 5% discount: 
     - Discount amount = 5% of $240 = 0.05 * $240 = $12
     - Total cost after discount = $240 - $12 = $228

Comparing the two options, Arjun can spend the least amount by becoming a member and paying $212.",212.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Arjun bought:

12 folders cost 12 * $4.75 = $57
8 erasers cost 8 * $14.5 = $116
1 ream of bond paper costs $11
7 pencils cost 7 * $8 = $56

The total cost is $57 + $116 + $11 + $56 = $240

Now, let's calculate the discount if Arjun becomes a member:

20% discount on $240 is 0.20 * $240 = $48
So, the total cost with the 20% discount is $240 - $48 = $192

However, Arjun also has to pay the $20 membership fee, so the total cost with the membership is $192 + $20 = $212

Now, let's calculate the discount if Arjun doesn't become a member:

5% discount on $240 is 0.05 * $240 = $12
So, the total cost with the 5% discount is $240 - $12 = $228

Comparing the two options, we can see that the least amount Arjun can spend on everything is $212, which is the cost with the membership.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row, than that he rolls four even numbers in a row?",50.0,"To solve this problem, we need to find the probabilities of each event and then compare them.

1. Rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row:

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a 20-sided die is 15/20, since there are 15 numbers greater than 5 (6-20). 

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is the product of the probabilities of each event: (15/20) × (15/20) = 225/400 = 0.5625.

To convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.5625 × 100 = 56.25%

2. Rolling four even numbers in a row:

The probability of rolling an even number on a 20-sided die is 10/20, since there are 10 even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20).

The probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is the product of the probabilities of each event: (10/20) × (10/20) × (10/20) × (10/20) = 10000/160000 = 0.0625.

To convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.0625 × 100 = 6.25%

Now, to find the difference in percentage points between the two events, subtract the smaller percentage from the larger percentage: 56.25 - 6.25 = 50.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events: rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row, and rolling four even numbers in a row.

There are 14 numbers greater than 5 (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20), out of a total of 20 possible outcomes. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is 14/20 = 0.7.

Since Yusuf is rolling the die twice, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row. This is equal to the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on the first roll, multiplied by the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on the second roll. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is 0.7 * 0.7 = 0.49.

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row. There are 10 even numbers on a twenty-sided die (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20), out of a total of 20 possible outcomes. So, the probability of rolling an even number is 10/20 = 0.5.

Since Yusuf is rolling the die four times, we need to calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row. This is equal to the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll, multiplied by the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll, multiplied by the probability of rolling an even number on the third roll, and multiplied by the probability of rolling an even number on the fourth roll. So, the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.0625.

Now, we can calculate the difference in percentage points between the two probabilities. To do this, we need to convert the probabilities to percentages by multiplying by 100. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is 0.49 * 100 = 49%, and the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is 0.0625 * 100 = 6.25%.

If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?",11000.0,"To find out how much more the total cost will be than Mrs. Lee's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the townhouse after the discount, brokerage fee, and transfer fee.

Step 1: Calculate the discounted selling price
Discount = 25% of $400,000 = 0.25 x $400,000 = $100,000
Discounted selling price = $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000

Step 2: Calculate the brokerage fee
Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000

She gets 4 kgs 1/4 off. So, 4 kgs will be 1/4 off and the rest 17 kgs will be at the regular price.
The regular price per kg is ₺22, so 17 kgs will be 17 * ₺22 = ₺374.
For the 4 kgs at 1/4 off, the price will be ₺22 * (3/4) = ₺16.5 per kg. 
So the 4 kgs at 1/4 off will be 4 * ₺16.5 = ₺66.
So the total cost of fudge is ₺374 + ₺66 = ₺440.
She also buys a mixed bag of sand dollars for ₺11.0 and 12 postcards that are ₺21.0 each, so 12 * ₺21.0 = ₺252.
So, the total cost of sand dollars and postcards is ₺11 + ₺252 = ₺263.
The total cost of fudge, sand dollars, and postcards is ₺440 + ₺263 = ₺703.
Priya also donated ₺5 at a charity stand.

What percentage of all the puppies have spots?",90.0,"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we need to first find the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

**Step 1: Find the total number of puppies**

Jamal's dog has 131 puppies.
Gabriel's dog has 47 puppies.
Yuki has 54 dogs, each having 13 puppies, so Yuki has 54 x 13 = 702 puppies.

Total number of puppies = 131 + 47 + 702 = 880 puppies.

**Step 2: Find the total number of puppies with spots**

Jamal's dog has 23 puppies with spots, but half of the unspotted puppies actually have spots, so we need to find the number of unspotted puppies first.

Unspotted puppies = 131 - 23 = 108 puppies.
Half of the unspotted puppies have spots, so 108 / 2 = 54 puppies have spots that were not visible before.

Total puppies with spots for Jamal = 23 + 54 = 77 puppies.

Gabriel's dog has 13 puppies with spots.
Yuki has 54 dogs, each having 13 puppies with spots, so Yuki has 54 x 13 = 702 puppies with spots.

Total number of puppies with spots = 77 + 13 + 702 = 792 puppies.

**Step 3: Find the percentage of puppies with spots**

Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) x 100

Therefore, 90% of all the puppies have spots.",90.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Jamal's dog has 131 puppies, 23 of which have spots.
So, the number of unspotted puppies is 131 - 23 = 108.
But, half of the unspotted puppies actually have spots, which means 108 / 2 = 54 puppies have spots that were not visible before.
So, the total number of puppies with spots is 23 + 54 = 77.

Gabriel's dog has 47 puppies, 13 of which have spots.

Yuki has 54 dogs, each having 13 puppies with spots.
So, the total number of puppies with spots from Yuki's dogs is 54 * 13 = 702.

Now, let's find the total number of puppies with spots from all three: 77 + 13 + 702 = 792.

Next, let's find the total number of puppies: 131 + 47 + (54 * 13) = 131 + 47 + 702 = 880.

Apples: 4 boxes x 3 kg/box = 12 kg
Cucumbers: 12 bags x 6 kg/bag = 72 kg
Hay: 34 packs x 39 kg/pack = 1326 kg
Corn: 20 sacks x 17 kg/sack = 340 kg

Wood: 100 kg

Total weight of all items = 12 kg + 72 kg + 1326 kg + 340 kg + 43 kg + 27 kg + 100 kg = 1920 kg

Since each truck can carry 160 kg, the total weight that the three trucks can carry is:
3 trucks x 160 kg/truck = 480 kg

Now, let's divide the total weight of all items by the total weight that the three trucks can carry:
1920 kg ÷ 480 kg = 4

So, the farmer needs to make 4 trips to transport all the purchased items.",4.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The farmer buys 4 boxes of apples, each weighing 3 kg.
So, the total weight of apples is 4 * 3 = 12 kg.

He buys 12 bags of cucumbers, each weighing 6 kg.
So, the total weight of cucumbers is 12 * 6 = 72 kg.

He buys 34 packs of hay, each weighing 39 kg.
So, the total weight of hay is 34 * 39 = 1326 kg.

He buys 20 sacks of corn, each weighing 17 kg.
So, the total weight of corn is 20 * 17 = 340 kg.

He also buys 43 kg of groceries, 27 kg of tools, and 100 kg of wood.
So, the total weight of these items is 43 + 27 + 100 = 170 kg.

12 kg (apples) + 72 kg (cucumbers) + 1326 kg (hay) + 340 kg (corn) + 170 kg (other items) = 1920 kg.

Each truck can carry 160 kg at a time.
To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we'll divide the total weight by the weight each truck can carry:

Later, Uma saw another 10-foot shark with 6 remoras, each 8 inches long, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?",45.0,"To find the percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras, we need to find the total length of the remoras and divide it by the shark's body length.

For the 40-foot shark:
There are 18 remoras initially, but 1/6 of them swam away. So, the number of remoras that stayed is:
18 - (1/6) * 18 = 18 - 3 = 15 remoras

Each remora is 16 inches long, so the total length of the remoras is:
15 * 16 inches = 240 inches

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the total length of the remoras is:
240 inches / 12 = 20 feet

The shark's body length is 40 feet, so the percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras is:
(20 feet / 40 feet) * 100% = 50%

For the 10-foot shark:
There are 6 remoras, each 8 inches long, so the total length of the remoras is:
6 * 8 inches = 48 inches

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the total length of the remoras is:
48 inches / 12 = 4 feet

The shark's body length is 10 feet, so the percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras is:
(4 feet / 10 feet) * 100% = 40%

To find the average percentage, we add the percentages and divide by 2:
(50% + 40%) / 2 = 90% / 2 = 45%

So, on average, 45% of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras.",45.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the total length of the remoras attached to the 40-foot shark. 
There are 18 remoras, each 16 inches long. 
Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert the length of the remoras to feet. 
16 inches is equal to 16/12 = 1.33 feet. 
So, the total length of the remoras is 18 * 1.33 = 24 feet.

Then, 1/6 of the remoras swam away. 
1/6 of 18 remoras is 18 / 6 = 3 remoras. 
So, 3 remoras swam away, leaving 18 - 3 = 15 remoras. 
The total length of the remaining remoras is 15 * 1.33 = 20 feet.

Now, let's calculate the percentage of the 40-foot shark's body length covered by the remoras. 
The percentage is (20 / 40) * 100 = 50%.

Next, we need to find the total length of the remoras attached to the 10-foot shark. 
There are 6 remoras, each 8 inches long. 
Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert the length of the remoras to feet. 
8 inches is equal to 8/12 = 0.67 feet. 
So, the total length of the remoras is 6 * 0.67 = 4 feet.

Now, let's calculate the percentage of the 10-foot shark's body length covered by the remoras. 
The percentage is (4 / 10) * 100 = 40%.

1. First, we need to find out how many almonds each table can hold. Since each table can hold three times as many almonds as each bowl, and each bowl can hold 24 almonds, each table can hold 24 * 3 = 72 almonds.

2. Carlos has 3 tables initially, but 2 tables break. So, he now has 3 - 2 = 1 table.

3. Carlos has 7 bowls and 1 table. The total number of almonds these can hold is 7 * 24 (bowls) + 1 * 72 (table) = 168 + 72 = 240 almonds.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of skeins needed for the grandchildren's winter wear**

* Shawl: 5 skeins x 4 grandchildren = 20 skeins
* Sweater: 6 skeins x 4 grandchildren = 24 skeins
* Poncho: 8 skeins x 4 grandchildren = 32 skeins
* Gloves: 8 skeins x 4 grandchildren = 32 skeins

The store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs; any additional rice is sold at the regular price. Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2. How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,"To calculate how much Mohammed has to pay, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the total amount of rice Mohammed needs to buy for a week:
Mohammed uses 3 kgs of rice per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, he needs:
3 kgs/day * 7 days = 21 kgs

2. Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice:
The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. So, the cost of the more expensive brand is:
¥15 + (20% of ¥15)
= ¥15 + (0.20 * ¥15)
= ¥15 + ¥3
= ¥18 per kg

3. Calculate the total cost of the rice before discount:
Mohammed needs 21 kgs of rice, and the more expensive brand costs ¥18 per kg. So, the total cost is:
21 kgs * ¥18 per kg = ¥378

4. Calculate the discount on the rice:
The store has a 40% discount on rice up to 10 kgs. Since Mohammed needs 21 kgs, he will get a discount on the first 10 kgs. The discount is:
40% of (10 kgs * ¥18 per kg)
= 0.40 * (10 * ¥18)
= ¥72

5. Calculate the total cost of the rice after discount:
Mohammed gets a discount of ¥72 on the first 10 kgs. The remaining 11 kgs (21 - 10) will be sold at the regular price. The cost of the remaining 11 kgs is:
11 kgs * ¥18 per kg = ¥198
The total cost of the rice after discount is:
¥378 - ¥72 = ¥306
Since the discount only applies to the first 10 kgs, we need to add the cost of the remaining 11 kgs to the discounted amount, but for the first 10 kgs we already calculated that as ¥306 so we need to calculate the discounted amount for the first 10 kgs 
¥306 - ¥198 = ¥108 + ¥198 = ¥306. Since the 40% discount only applies up to 10 kgs, we need to calculate the 40% discount for the first 10 kgs and then add the remaining 11 kgs at the full price.
¥306 is the correct total cost for the rice after discount but we can break it down into 
¥108 is the cost for the first 10 kgs after the 40% discount and ¥198 for the remaining 11 kgs, so total cost is ¥108 + ¥198 = ¥306.

6. Add the cost of the bagel:
Mohammed also buys a bagel for ¥2. So, the total amount he needs to pay is:
¥306 (rice) + ¥2 (bagel) = ¥308

Therefore, Mohammed needs to pay ¥308.",308.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Mohammed needs to buy a week's worth of rice, which is 7 days.

So, the total amount of rice he needs is 7 * 3 = 21 kgs.

The normal brand of rice costs ¥15 per kg, but he has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more.
To find the price of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate 20% of ¥15.
20% of ¥15 is 0.20 * ¥15 = ¥3.
So, the price of the more expensive brand is ¥15 + ¥3 = ¥18 per kg.

However, the store has a 40% discount on rice, which applies only up to 10 kgs.
Mohammed needs 21 kgs of rice, so he will get a discount on the first 10 kgs.
The price of the first 10 kgs with the discount is ¥18 * 0.60 = ¥10.80 per kg.
The total cost of the first 10 kgs is ¥10.80 * 10 = ¥108.

For the remaining 11 kgs (21 - 10 = 11), there is no discount.
The price of the remaining 11 kgs is ¥18 * 11 = ¥198.

The total cost of the rice is ¥108 + ¥198 = ¥306.

Mohammed also buys a bagel for ¥2.

However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,"To find out how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week, we'll first need to determine the total number of signatures Jasmine and Mia have collected so far and how many they need to collect in the remaining 2 weeks.

Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31. So, the total number of signatures they have collected so far is:
36 (Jasmine) + 31 (Mia) = 67

The sisters want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. To find out how many more signatures they need, we'll subtract the number of signatures they have collected so far from their goal:
145 (goal) - 67 (current signatures) = 78

Since they have 2 weeks left, we'll divide the number of signatures they need by 2 to find the total number of signatures they need to collect per week:
78 / 2 = 39

Now, we need to find out how many signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks. Since Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5, we'll first need to find out how many signatures Jasmine collected per week in the first 6 weeks. We'll divide Jasmine's total signatures by 6:
36 / 6 = 6

Since Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5, we'll subtract 5 from her original weekly collection:
6 - 5 = 1 (However, this is not possible as she cannot collect a negative number of signatures. We will assume Jasmine collected 6 signatures per week for the first 6 weeks, and for the remaining 2 weeks, she will collect 1 signature per weekend day, which is 2 signatures per weekend. Since there are 2 weekends in 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect 2 * 2 = 4 signatures in the remaining 2 weeks.)

Now, we'll subtract the number of signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks from the total number of signatures they need to collect per week:
39 (total signatures per week) - 2 (Jasmine's signatures per week) = 37 (However, Jasmine will collect 4 signatures in 2 weeks, so we will divide the total signatures Jasmine will collect in 2 weeks by 2 to get her weekly collection, which is 4 / 2 = 2. Then we will subtract 2 from 39 to get 37, but we will divide 37 by 2 to get the number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week to reach their goal, which is 37 / 2 = 18.5. However, we will use 37 - 4 = 33, then 33 / 2 = 16.5. We will round up to the nearest whole number to ensure they reach their goal, so Mia needs to collect 17 signatures per week.)

However, we will use the following method to calculate the number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week.

The number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week is 74 / 2 = 37.",37.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

The sisters have 36 + 31 = 67 signatures in total.
They want to reach 145 signatures in total by the end of 2 more weeks.
So, they need to collect 145 - 67 = 78 more signatures in the remaining 2 weeks.

Jasmine normally collects signatures every day, but during the remaining 2 weeks, she can only collect signatures on weekends, which means she can only collect 5 signatures per week less than she normally does. We don't know how many she normally collects, but we can say she will collect x - 5 signatures per week.

Since there are 2 weeks left, Jasmine will collect a total of 2 * (x - 5) signatures.

Mia will collect y signatures per week, and she has 2 weeks left, so she will collect a total of 2 * y signatures.

The total signatures they will collect in the remaining 2 weeks is the sum of what Jasmine and Mia collect, so 2 * (x - 5) + 2 * y = 78.

We also know that Jasmine normally collects 36 / 6 = 6 signatures per week, so x = 6. 

Now, we can plug this value into the equation we derived earlier. We now have 2 * (6 - 5) + 2 * y = 78.
This simplifies to 2 + 2 * y = 78.

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we have 2 * y = 76.
Dividing both sides by 2, we have y = 38.

Jasmine and Mia have a total of 36 + 31 = 67 signatures so far.
They want to reach 145 signatures in total.
So, they need to collect 145 - 67 = 78 more signatures in the next 2 weeks.

Jasmine can only collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week.
Let's assume her original weekly collection was x.
Then, her reduced weekly collection is x - 5.
Since she has 2 weeks left, she will collect 2(x - 5) signatures.

Mia wants to increase her weekly collection.
Let's assume she will collect y signatures per week.
Since she has 2 weeks left, she will collect 2y signatures.

The total number of signatures they will collect in the next 2 weeks is 2(x - 5) + 2y.
They need to collect 78 more signatures, so we can set up the equation:
2(x - 5) + 2y = 78

Since Jasmine originally collected 36 signatures in 6 weeks, her original weekly collection was 36 / 6 = 6.
So, her reduced weekly collection is 6 - 5 = 1.
In 2 weeks, she will collect 2(1) = 2 signatures.

Now, we can rewrite the equation:
2 + 2y = 78

Subtracting 2 from both sides:
2y = 76

Dividing both sides by 2:
y = 38

He makes 48 total ice cubes, including 10 giant cubes, 14 small cubes, 12 medium cubes, and some tiny cubes. How many ounces of water does Leon have left?",122.0,"To find out how many ounces of water Leon has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used to make the ice cubes and subtract it from the initial amount of water (312 ounces).

1. Calculate the amount of water used for giant cubes:
   10 giant cubes * 12 ounces per cube = 10 * 12 = 120 ounces

2. Calculate the amount of water used for medium cubes:
   12 medium cubes * 5 ounces per cube = 12 * 5 = 60 ounces

3. Calculate the amount of water used for small cubes:
   14 small cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 14 * 0.5 = 7 ounces

4. Calculate the number of tiny cubes:
   Total cubes = 48
   Giant cubes = 10
   Medium cubes = 12
   Small cubes = 14
   Tiny cubes = Total cubes - (Giant cubes + Medium cubes + Small cubes)
   Tiny cubes = 48 - (10 + 12 + 14) = 48 - 36 = 12

5. Calculate the amount of water used for tiny cubes:
   Since tiny cubes are half the size of small cubes, they use 0.5 / 2 = 0.25 ounces per cube.
   12 tiny cubes * 0.25 ounces per cube = 12 * 0.25 = 3 ounces

6. Calculate the total amount of water used:
   Total water used = Water used for giant cubes + Water used for medium cubes + Water used for small cubes + Water used for tiny cubes
   Total water used = 120 + 60 + 7 + 3 = 190 ounces

7. Calculate the amount of water left:

   Water left = 312 - 190 = 122 ounces

Leon has 122 ounces of water left.",122.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Leon starts with 312 ounces of water.

He makes 10 giant cubes, each using 12 ounces of water.
So, the total water used for giant cubes is 10 * 12 = 120 ounces.

He makes 14 small cubes, each using 1/2 ounce of water.
So, the total water used for small cubes is 14 * 0.5 = 7 ounces.

He makes 12 medium cubes, each using 5 ounces of water.
So, the total water used for medium cubes is 12 * 5 = 60 ounces.

Let's calculate the total water used so far:
120 (giant) + 7 (small) + 60 (medium) = 187 ounces.

Since Leon makes 48 total ice cubes, and we already know he made 10 giant, 14 small, and 12 medium cubes, we can find the number of tiny cubes:
48 (total) - 10 (giant) - 14 (small) - 12 (medium) = 12 tiny cubes.

Each tiny cube is half the size of a small cube, which is 1/2 ounce. So, each tiny cube uses 1/4 ounce of water.
The total water used for tiny cubes is 12 * 0.25 = 3 ounces.

Now, let's calculate the total water used:
187 (giant, small, medium) + 3 (tiny) = 190 ounces.

What percentage of the students like to play video games if the number of the students that like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football?",5.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.

First, let's find the total number of students who like to hike, play chess, swim, and play football:

69 (hike) + 8 (chess) + 13 (swim) + 13 (football) = 103

Since there are 160 students in total, the number of students who like to play video games or bake is:

160 - 103 = 57

Now, let's use the information that the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football. If x is the number of students who like to bake, we can set up the equation:

x = 4(13) - 3
x = 52 - 3
x = 49

However, x (the number of students who like to bake) cannot be 49, since that would exceed the total number of students who like to play video games or bake (57). 

Let's re-evaluate the equation. We know that the total number of students who like to play video games or bake is 57. If the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football, we can set up an equation with the number of students who like to play video games (y) and the number of students who like to bake (x):

x + y = 57

We know that x = 4(13) - 3. However, we also have a constraint that x + y = 57 and x ≤ 57. Since the actual value of x is more than half of 57, we should take the actual value of x as 4 times the number of students who prefer playing football minus 3 and then check if this value, when added to another positive value, is equal to 57.

However, given the information, x = 4(13) - 3 would be more than half of 57, we can recalculate the value of '4 times the number of students who prefer playing football minus 3' with x as 'three times the number of students who prefer playing football plus 3'. 

x = 3(13) + 3 = 42

Now that we know the number of students who like to bake (x) is not 49 but 42, we can find the number of students who like to play video games (y):

x + y = 57
42 + y = 57
y = 57 - 42
y = 15

To find the percentage of students who like to play video games, divide the number of students who like to play video games by the total number of students and multiply by 100:

(15/160) * 100 = 9.375%

So, approximately 9.38% of the students like to play video games.",9.38,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of students who like to hike, play chess, swim, and play football.
Number of students who like to hike = 69
Number of students who like to play chess = 8
Number of students who like to swim = 13
Number of students who like to play football = 13
Total number of students who like these activities = 69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103

Now, we know that the rest of the students like to either play video games or bake. So, the total number of students who like to play video games or bake is:
160 (total students) - 103 (students who like other activities) = 57

We are also given that the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football. Let's use this information to find the number of students who like to bake.
Number of students who like to play football = 13
Four times this number = 4 * 13 = 52
Three less than this number = 52 - 3 = 49

So, the number of students who like to bake is 49.

Now, we can find the number of students who like to play video games:
Total number of students who like to play video games or bake = 57
Number of students who like to bake = 49
Number of students who like to play video games = 57 - 49 = 8

Finally, we can find the percentage of students who like to play video games:

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the workshop**

The cost for each day is:
₣100 (hotel) + ₣20 (food) + ₣10 (transportation) = ₣130

Since the workshop is for 2 days, the total cost is:
2 x ₣130 = ₣260

**Step 2: Subtract the cost of food, which is covered by Oliver's friends**

The cost of food for 2 days is:

The charity will cover 1/10 of the remaining cost:
1/10 x ₣220 = ₣22

**Step 4: Calculate the amount Oliver still needs to cover**

Oliver has ₣85, and the charity will cover ₣22, so the amount Oliver still needs to cover is:

**Step 1: Find the cost of a bagel**

The cost of a bagel is one-fourth of a loaf of bread, which costs €5. So, the cost of a bagel is:

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of 8 bagels with a 20% discount**

Since the bakery has a promotion that offers a 20% discount on 7 or more bagels, we'll apply the discount to the cost of 8 bagels.

First, calculate the total cost of 8 bagels without the discount:

8 bagels × €1.25 = €10

Then, apply the 20% discount:

€10 × 0.20 = €2 (discount amount)
€10 - €2 = €8 (cost of 8 bagels with discount)

The cost of 4 loaves of bread is:

4 loaves × €5 = €20

**Step 4: Find the difference in cost between 4 loaves of bread and 8 bagels**

First, we need to find the cost of a bagel.
Since the cost of a bagel is one-fourth of a loaf of bread, we need to calculate one-fourth of €5.
One-fourth of €5 is €5 / 4 = €1.25.
So, a bagel costs €1.25.

Next, we need to find the cost of 8 bagels.
However, the bakery has a promotion that gives a 20% discount on 7 or more bagels.
Since 8 bagels are more than 7, we get a 20% discount.
The original price of 8 bagels is 8 * €1.25 = €10.

Jamal buys 10 gallons of paint at $7.00 each, but as a member, he gets a 10% discount. So, the price of paint for Jamal is $7.00 - (10% of $7.00) = $7.00 - $0.70 = $6.30 per gallon. The total cost of paint for Jamal is 10 * $6.30 = $63.00.
He also buys 3 carpenter pencils at $2.00 each, so the total cost of pencils is 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

Now, let's go back to Elena's paint. Since she is not a member, she pays the full price of $7.00 per gallon. The total cost of paint for Elena is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00.

Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks.",530.0,"To find the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of occupied rooms: 
   The care facility has a capacity of 1900 rooms, and 1/4 of them are occupied. 
   Number of occupied rooms = 1900 * 1/4 
   Number of occupied rooms = 1900 * 0.25 
   Number of occupied rooms = 475 

2. Calculate the number of rooms out of service: 
   One-fourth of all the rooms are out of service. 
   Number of rooms out of service = 1900 * 1/4 
   Number of rooms out of service = 1900 * 0.25 
   Number of rooms out of service = 475 

3. Calculate the number of unoccupied rooms available initially: 
   Total rooms = 1900 
   Number of unoccupied rooms = Total rooms - Number of occupied rooms - Number of rooms out of service 
   Number of unoccupied rooms = 1900 - 475 - 475 
   Number of unoccupied rooms = 950 

4. Calculate the total number of patients admitted in 3 weeks: 
   The care facility admits 20 patients per day. 
   There are 7 days in a week, so the care facility admits 20 * 7 = 140 patients per week. 
   In 3 weeks, the care facility will admit 140 * 3 = 420 patients. 

5. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks: 
   Number of unoccupied rooms = Initial unoccupied rooms - Patients admitted in 3 weeks 
   Number of unoccupied rooms = 950 - 420 
   Number of unoccupied rooms = 530 

The total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks is 530.",530.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The care facility has a capacity of 1900 rooms.
One-fourth of the rooms are occupied, which is 1900 * 1/4 = 1900 / 4 = 475 rooms.
One-fourth of the rooms are out of service, which is also 1900 * 1/4 = 1900 / 4 = 475 rooms.
So, the total number of rooms that are either occupied or out of service is 475 + 475 = 950 rooms.
The number of rooms that are available and unoccupied is 1900 - 950 = 950 rooms.

Now, let's calculate the number of patients admitted in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.
20 patients are admitted each day, so the total number of patients admitted in 21 days is 20 * 21 = 420 patients.
Since each patient occupies one room, the number of rooms occupied by the new patients is also 420.

The total number of unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks is 950 - 420 = 530 rooms.

If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?",796.0,"To find Faisal's average daily earnings, we need to calculate his total earnings over the three days and then divide by 3.

Let's break down the information:

Wednesday: 
Muffins = 27 boxes
Apricot pies = 13 fewer than Thursday, so we'll come back to this later.

Thursday:
Muffins = 11 more than Wednesday = 27 + 11 = 38 boxes
Apricot pies = 21 boxes

Now we can find the number of apricot pies sold on Wednesday:
Wednesday: Apricot pies = 21 - 13 = 8 boxes

Wednesday's earnings: 
Muffins: 27 * ₺9 = ₺243
Apricot pies: 8 * ₺21 = ₺168
Total: ₺243 + ₺168 = ₺411

Thursday's earnings:
Muffins: 38 * ₺9 = ₺342
Apricot pies: 21 * ₺21 = ₺441
Total: ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783

Friday:

Average daily earnings:
₺2388 / 3 = ₺796

Faisal's average daily earnings are ₺796.",796.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's find out how many boxes of muffins and apricot pies Faisal sold on Wednesday and Thursday.

On Wednesday, he sold 27 boxes of muffins.
On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday, so he sold 27 + 11 = 38 boxes of muffins.

On Wednesday, he sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie than on Thursday, and on Thursday, he sold 21 boxes of apricot pie. So, on Wednesday, he sold 21 - 13 = 8 boxes of apricot pie.

Now, let's find out how many boxes of muffins and apricot pies Faisal sold on Friday.
On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. So, the total number of boxes of muffins sold on Friday is 27 + 38 = 65 boxes of muffins.
The total number of boxes of apricot pie sold on Friday is 8 + 21 = 29 boxes of apricot pie.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes of muffins and apricot pies sold over the three days.
The total number of boxes of muffins sold is 27 + 38 + 65 = 130 boxes of muffins.
The total number of boxes of apricot pie sold is 8 + 21 + 29 = 58 boxes of apricot pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings over the three days.
The total earnings from muffins is 130 * ₺9 = ₺1170.
The total earnings from apricot pie is 58 * ₺21 = ₺1218.
The total earnings is ₺1170 + ₺1218 = ₺2388.

Half of the swimmers are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the tournament?",66.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of swimmers**
There are 120 students in the class, and 50% of them are swimmers. To find the number of swimmers, we'll multiply 120 by 0.5.

120 x 0.5 = 60

So, there are 60 swimmers in the class.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of swimmers who are absent**
Half of the swimmers are absent due to illness. To find the number of absent swimmers, we'll divide the total number of swimmers by 2.

60 ÷ 2 = 30

So, 30 swimmers are absent.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of swimmers who are leaving early**
Since 30 swimmers are absent, the number of swimmers who are leaving early is the total number of swimmers minus the absent swimmers.

60 - 30 = 30

So, 30 swimmers are leaving early.

**Step 4: Calculate the number of remaining students**
There are 120 students in the class, and 60 are swimmers. To find the number of remaining students, we'll subtract the number of swimmers from the total number of students.

120 - 60 = 60

So, there are 60 remaining students.

**Step 5: Calculate the number of choir members or dancers**
45% of the remaining students are choir members or dancers. To find the number of choir members or dancers, we'll multiply the number of remaining students by 0.45.

60 x 0.45 = 27

So, there are 27 choir members or dancers.

**Step 6: Calculate the total number of students leaving early**
We have 30 swimmers, 27 choir members or dancers, and 3 cheerleaders for each group. Since there are 3 groups (swimmers, choir members, and dancers), we'll multiply the number of cheerleaders by 3.

3 x 3 = 9

Now, let's add up the total number of students leaving early:

First, we need to find the number of swimmers in the class. Since 50% of the class are swimmers, we can calculate this as:
50% of 120 = 0.5 * 120 = 60 swimmers.

However, half of the swimmers are absent due to sickness, so the number of swimmers leaving early is:
60 / 2 = 30 swimmers.

Next, we need to find the number of students who are choir members or part of dancers. Since 50% of the class are swimmers, the remaining class is:
120 - 60 = 60 students.

Out of these 60 students, 45% are choir members or part of dancers, so we can calculate this as:
45% of 60 = 0.45 * 60 = 27 students.

Now, we need to add the number of swimmers, choir members, and dancers who are leaving early, as well as the 3 cheerleaders accompanying each group. However, since there are only 3 groups (swimmers, choir members, and dancers), we only need to add 3 cheerleaders in total, not 3 for each group.

How many students are leaving early to the tournament?
A: Let's think step by step.
There are 120 students in the class.
50% of the students are swimmers, which is 0.5 * 120 = 60 students.
Out of the remaining class, 120 - 60 = 60 students are left.
45% of the remaining students are choir members or part of dancers, which is 0.45 * 60 = 27 students.
So, there are 60 swimmers and 27 choir members or dancers, and 3 groups of students in total. 
The number of students not in these groups is 120 - (60 + 27) = 33 students.
Half of the swimmers are absent for being sick, which is 60 / 2 = 30 swimmers. 
Now, the number of swimmers is 60 - 30 = 30 swimmers.
The 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away tournament, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. That is 3 * (3) = 9 cheerleaders. They add to the total number of students, but not to the groups of students.

However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",31.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total space available for plants**

The flower bed is 132 meters long, and each plant (including the space between plants) takes up 3 meters (plant width) + 12 meters (space between plants) = 15 meters.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed**

To find the number of plants that can fit, we'll divide the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant takes up:

132 meters (flower bed length) ÷ 15 meters (space per plant) = 8.8

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 8 plants. This means Olga can fit 8 plants in her flower bed.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of plants Olga needs to buy**

Olga already owns 7 flowers, so she needs to buy:

8 plants (total needed) - 7 plants (already owned) = 1 plant

**Step 4: Calculate the cost of the plants**

Each plant costs ₣9. Since Olga is buying only 1 plant, she won't receive the ₣5 discount.

Cost of 1 plant = ₣9

However, if Olga were buying more than 2 plants, she would receive the discount. But in this case, she's buying only 1 plant, so the discount doesn't apply.

**Answer:** Olga will spend ₣9 at the store to fill up her flower bed.",9.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

The length of the flower bed is 132 meters.
Each plant occupies 3 meters (its width) plus 12 meters of space, for a total of 3 + 12 = 15 meters.
To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length by the space each plant occupies: 132 / 15 = 8.8.
Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 8 plants that can fit in the flower bed.
Olga already has 7 plants, so she needs to buy 8 - 7 = 1 more plant.

However, since Olga needs to fill her flower bed with 8 plants and already has 7, let's recalculate the space: 
There are already 7 plants, each plant occupies 15 meters. 
7 plants will occupy 7 * 15 = 105 meters.
There are 132 - 105 = 27 meters left.
Since each plant occupies 15 meters, we can't fit another plant in 27 meters. 
Therefore, we can only fit 7 plants in the flower bed.
However, the task is to fill the flower bed, so let's recalculate and include the last plant with its width: 
7 plants will occupy 7 * 15 = 105 meters.
There are 132 - 105 = 27 meters left.
Let's include the width of the last plant (3 meters), so we have 27 - 3 = 24 meters left for the last plant to occupy.
Given the last plant occupies 15 meters including space, we don't have enough space for it.
So we can only fit 7 plants in the flower bed. 
However the task is to fill the flower bed, so the last plant will have to be planted without space between it and the other plant, which isn't part of the problem but it is the only possible way to fill the flower bed, 
So we have 7 plants already, we will need 1 more plant to fill the flower bed.
To fill the flower bed, she needs to buy 1 more plant.
Each plant costs ₣9, so the total cost is 1 x ₣9 = ₣9.
However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase.
Since she's only buying 1 plant, she won't receive the discount.

How many minutes will it take her to peel and saute 150 clams if it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam before peeling it? Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.,163.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to wash the clams**

Olga needs to wash 150 clams, and it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam. To find the total time, we'll multiply the number of clams by the time it takes to wash each clam:

150 clams × 12 seconds/clam = 1800 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we'll convert the time to minutes:

1800 seconds ÷ 60 = 30 minutes

**Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to peel the clams**

Olga can peel 6 clams per minute. To find the time it takes to peel 150 clams, we'll divide the number of clams by the rate at which she peels them:

150 clams ÷ 6 clams/minute = 25 minutes

**Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to sauté the clams**

Olga can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes. To find the time it takes to sauté 150 clams, we'll multiply the time it takes to sauté 30 clams by the number of groups of 30 clams:

150 clams ÷ 30 clams/group = 5 groups

5 groups × 19 minutes/group = 95 minutes

**Step 4: Add the break time**

Olga needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them. We'll add this break time to the total time:

**Step 5: Calculate the total time**

Now, we'll add up the time it takes to wash the clams, peel the clams, take the break, and sauté the clams:

30 minutes (washing) + 25 minutes (peeling) + 13 minutes (break) + 95 minutes (sautéing) = 163 minutes

Therefore, it will take Olga 163 minutes to peel and sauté 150 clams.",150.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to calculate the time it takes Olga to peel 150 clams. She can peel 6 clams per minute.
So, the time it takes to peel 150 clams is 150 / 6 = 25 minutes.

Before peeling, she needs to wash each clam, which takes 12 seconds per clam. There are 150 clams, so the total washing time is 150 * 12 seconds = 1800 seconds.
We need to convert this to minutes: 1800 seconds / 60 = 30 minutes.

So, the total time spent washing and peeling the clams is 30 minutes + 25 minutes = 55 minutes.

After peeling, Olga takes a 13-minute break.

Then, she starts sautéing the clams. She can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes.
To find out how many minutes it takes to sauté 150 clams, we can set up a proportion: 30 clams / 19 minutes = 150 clams / x minutes.
Cross-multiplying, we get 30x = 150 * 19.
Dividing both sides by 30, we get x = (150 * 19) / 30 = 95 minutes.

Now, we add up the time spent washing, peeling, taking a break, and sautéing: 55 minutes + 13 minutes + 95 minutes = 163 minutes.

Total pizzas in two months = 1350 + 405 = 1755

The family eats 1755 pizzas in two months.",1755.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many pizzas the family eats per day. 
The uncle eats 10 pizzas per day.
His spouse eats 20 pizzas per day.
So, the combined number of pizzas they eat per day is 10 + 20 = 30 pizzas.

The grandchild eats two-fourths of the combined number of pizzas they eat per day.
Two-fourths is the same as 1/2, so the grandchild eats 1/2 * 30 = 15 pizzas per day.

Now, we add the number of pizzas the grandchild eats to the number of pizzas the uncle and spouse eat.
So, the total number of pizzas the family eats per day is 30 + 15 = 45 pizzas.

Since there are 30 days in a month, the total number of pizzas the family eats in the first month is 45 * 30 = 1350 pizzas.

Now, let's calculate the number of pizzas the family eats in the second month.
For the first half of the month, they reduce their food consumption by 60%.
So, they eat 40% of their original amount, which is 0.4 * 45 = 18 pizzas per day.
Since there are 15 days in the first half of the month, they eat 18 * 15 = 270 pizzas.

For the second half of the month, they reduce their food consumption by an additional 50%.
So, they eat 50% of their previous amount, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 pizzas per day.
Since there are 15 days in the second half of the month, they eat 9 * 15 = 135 pizzas.

Now, we add the number of pizzas they eat in the first half and the second half of the month.
So, the total number of pizzas they eat in the second month is 270 + 135 = 405 pizzas.

Finally, we add the number of pizzas they eat in the first month and the second month.
So, the total number of pizzas they eat in two months is 1350 + 405 = 1755 pizzas.

Total seats reserved = 700 + 450 + 50 = 1200

Now, let's subtract the reserved seats from the total seats to find the number of seats available for friends and family:

9600 - 1200 = 8400

Since there are 700 graduates, we'll divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive:

Mohammed work overtime on the last day so he can respond to 10% more emails than usual.",61.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of emails that don't require a response.
20% of 30 emails is 0.20 x 30 = 6 emails.

Step 2: Calculate the number of emails that require a response.
30 (total emails) - 6 (emails that don't require a response) = 24 emails.

Step 3: Calculate the number of emails Mohammed can respond to on a normal day.
1/2 of 24 emails is 24 / 2 = 12 emails.
Mohammed can respond to 2 less than that, so 12 - 2 = 10 emails per day.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of emails Mohammed responds to in a 5-day workweek.
10 emails per day x 5 days = 50 emails.

Step 5: Calculate the number of emails Mohammed can respond to on the last day (overtime).
On the last day, Mohammed can respond to 10% more emails than usual.
10% of 10 emails is 0.10 x 10 = 1 email.
So, on the last day, Mohammed can respond to 10 + 1 = 11 emails.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of emails Mohammed responds to in a 6-day workweek.

Mohammed responds to 61 emails in a 6-day workweek.",6.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
Mohammed receives 30 emails a day.
20% of those emails don't require any response.

The number of emails that require a response is 30 - 6 = 24 emails.
From the rest, Mohammed can only respond to 2 less than 1/2 of them. 
So, 1/2 of the emails that require a response is 24 / 2 = 12 emails.
Mohammed can respond to 2 less than 12, which is 12 - 2 = 10 emails.
Since Mohammed works for 6 days, normally he can respond to 10 * 6 = 60 emails.
On the last day, he can respond to 10% more emails than usual.

On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?",85.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Find Ananya's original speed on the beach**

Let's call Ananya's original speed on the beach ""x"" miles per hour. Since she walks 10 miles on the beach, the time taken to walk on the beach is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 10 miles / x miles/hour

We know that Ananya spends 50 minutes on the beach, so we can convert this to hours:

50 minutes = 50/60 hours = 5/6 hours

Now, we can set up an equation:

10 miles / x miles/hour = 5/6 hours

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by x:

10 = (5/6)x

Now, multiply both sides by 6:

60 = 5x

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 12 miles/hour

So, Ananya's original speed on the beach is 12 miles per hour.

**Step 2: Find Ananya's original speed on the sidewalk**

We know that Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. So, her original speed on the sidewalk is:

2x = 2(12) = 24 miles/hour

**Step 3: Find Ananya's new speed on the beach and sidewalk**

Due to the injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. So, her new speed on the beach is:

New speed on beach = x/2 = 12/2 = 6 miles/hour

And her new speed on the sidewalk is:

New speed on sidewalk = 2x/2 = 24/2 = 12 miles/hour

**Step 4: Find the time taken to walk on the sidewalk**

Ananya walks 14 miles on the sidewalk. The time taken to walk on the sidewalk is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 14 miles / 12 miles/hour

Time = 14/12 hours = 7/6 hours

Convert this to minutes:

7/6 hours = (7/6) × 60 minutes = 70 minutes

**Step 5: Find the total time taken to complete the entire walk**

Ananya spends 50 minutes on the beach and 70 minutes on the sidewalk. The total time taken to complete the entire walk is:

Total time = 50 minutes + 70 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, it takes Ananya 120 minutes to complete the entire 24-mile walk.",24.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Ananya walks 10 miles on the beach and 14 miles on the sidewalk.
She walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.
However, her speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk due to an injury.
Let's first find her original speed on the beach. We know she spends 50 minutes walking 10 miles on the beach, but her speed has decreased by half. So, her original speed on the beach would have allowed her to walk 10 miles in 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.
Now, let's find her original speed on the beach in miles per minute. Her original speed on the beach is 10 miles / 25 minutes = 0.4 miles per minute.
Since she walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her original speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 miles per minute.
However, her speed has decreased by half due to the injury. So, her new speed on the sidewalk is 0.8 / 2 = 0.4 miles per minute.
Now, let's find the time it takes for her to walk 14 miles on the sidewalk at her new speed. The time is 14 miles / 0.4 miles per minute = 35 minutes.
We already know she spends 50 minutes walking on the beach.

Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the first 2 complexes:
2 complexes * 100 apartments/complex = 200 apartments

However, 9 apartments from each complex were vacant, so we subtract 18 apartments:
200 apartments - 18 apartments = 182 apartments

Step 2: Calculate the number of apartments in the 3rd complex:
The 3rd complex is 35% bigger than the other 2 combined. The other 2 combined have 200 apartments, so:
35% of 200 apartments = 0.35 * 200 apartments = 70 apartments
The 3rd complex has 200 apartments + 70 apartments = 270 apartments

The last complex is 35% bigger than the first 2 combined.
To find the number of apartments in the last complex, we need to calculate 35% of 200.
35% of 200 is 0.35 * 200 = 70.

To find the percentage of green bricks, we divide the number of green bricks by the total number of bricks and multiply by 100: (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.
The answer is 50%.",50.0,1,,50.0,1
gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"Olivia, Bodhi are currently 24 years apart in age. Olivia and Keisha are currently 15 years apart. Olivia, who is younger than Bodhi but older than Keisha, will be 42 in 7 years. How much younger is Keisha than the average age of all three?",18.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Olivia will be 42 in 7 years, so her current age is:
42 - 7 = 35

2. Since Olivia is 24 years younger than Bodhi, Bodhi's current age is:
35 + 24 = 59

3. Since Olivia is 15 years older than Keisha, Keisha's current age is:
35 - 15 = 20

4. Now, let's find the average age of all three:
(35 + 59 + 20) / 3 = 114 / 3 = 38

5. Finally, let's find out how much younger Keisha is than the average age:
38 - 20 = 18

So, Keisha is 18 years younger than the average age of all three.",18.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Olivia will be 42 in 7 years.
So, Olivia's current age is 42 - 7 = 35.

Since Olivia is 24 years younger than Bodhi, Bodhi's current age is 35 + 24 = 59.

Since Olivia is 15 years older than Keisha, Keisha's current age is 35 - 15 = 20.

To find the average age of all three, we need to add their ages and divide by 3.
The sum of their ages is 35 + 59 + 20 = 114.
The average age is 114 / 3 = 38.

To find out how much younger Keisha is than the average age, we subtract Keisha's age from the average age.
The difference is 38 - 20 = 18.

The answer is 18.",18.0,1,,18.0,1
