She bought 6 dozen croissants which cost $19 per dozen, 4 dozen macarons which cost $77 per dozen, and 3 dozen brownies for $118 per dozen. How much was the total cost if she received 25% discount on all purchases?",582.0,"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them up. After that, we can apply the 25% discount.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of croissants**
6 dozen croissants x $19 per dozen = 6 x $19 = $114

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of macarons**
4 dozen macarons x $77 per dozen = 4 x $77 = $308

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of brownies**
3 dozen brownies x $118 per dozen = 3 x $118 = $354

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost**
Add up the costs of all items: $114 + $308 + $354 = $776

**Step 5: Apply the 25% discount**
To find the discount amount, multiply the total cost by 25% (or 0.25):
$776 x 0.25 = $194

**Step 6: Calculate the final cost**
Subtract the discount amount from the total cost:
$776 - $194 = $582

Therefore, the total cost after the 25% discount is $582.",582.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the croissants.
Beatriz bought 6 dozen croissants at $19 per dozen.
So, the total cost of the croissants is 6 * $19 = $114.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the macarons.
Beatriz bought 4 dozen macarons at $77 per dozen.
So, the total cost of the macarons is 4 * $77 = $308.

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the brownies.
Beatriz bought 3 dozen brownies at $118 per dozen.
So, the total cost of the brownies is 3 * $118 = $354.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the purchases.
The total cost is $114 + $308 + $354 = $776.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost after the 25% discount.
The discount amount is 25% of $776, which is 0.25 * $776 = $194.
So, the total cost after the discount is $776 - $194 = $582.

The answer is $582.",582.0,1,,582.0,1

But as I pour it, I spill 7 liters of the mango drink. To make up for that, I add 7 liters of water to the mix. What percentage of the final mix is water?",50.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the mango drink**

You have 16 liters of mango drink that is one-ninth water. To find the amount of water, multiply the total amount by the fraction:

16 liters x (1/9) = 16/9 liters = 1.78 liters (approximately)

So, the mango drink contains approximately 1.78 liters of water.

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the apple drink**

You have 14 liters of apple drink that is one-half water. To find the amount of water, multiply the total amount by the fraction:

14 liters x (1/2) = 14/2 liters = 7 liters

So, the apple drink contains 7 liters of water.

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water after spilling the mango drink**

You spill 7 liters of the mango drink, which means you're left with:

16 liters - 7 liters = 9 liters of mango drink

The amount of water in the remaining mango drink is still 1.78 liters (since the spill doesn't change the proportion of water).

**Step 4: Calculate the total amount of water after adding water to the mix**

You add 7 liters of water to the mix to make up for the spill. The total amount of water now is:

1.78 liters (from mango drink) + 7 liters (from apple drink) + 7 liters (added water) = 15.78 liters

**Step 5: Calculate the total volume of the final mix**

The total volume of the final mix is the sum of the remaining mango drink, apple drink, and added water:

9 liters (mango drink) + 14 liters (apple drink) + 7 liters (added water) = 30 liters

**Step 6: Calculate the percentage of water in the final mix**

To find the percentage of water, divide the total amount of water by the total volume of the mix and multiply by 100:

(15.78 liters / 30 liters) x 100% ≈ 52.6%

So, the final mix is approximately 52.6% water.",52.6,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the mango drink:
The mango drink is one-ninth water, so the amount of water in 16 liters of mango drink is 16 * (1/9) = 16/9 = 1.78 liters.

Then, I spill 7 liters of the mango drink, so the amount of mango drink left is 16 - 7 = 9 liters.
The amount of water left in the mango drink is 1.78 * (9/16) = 1 liter.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the apple drink:
The apple drink is one-half water, so the amount of water in 14 liters of apple drink is 14 * (1/2) = 7 liters.

Now, I add the mango drink and apple drink together, and also add 7 liters of water to make up for the spill.
The total amount of water in the final mix is 1 liter (from the mango drink) + 7 liters (from the apple drink) + 7 liters (added water) = 15 liters.

The total amount of liquid in the final mix is 9 liters (mango drink) + 14 liters (apple drink) + 7 liters (added water) = 30 liters.

So, the percentage of the final mix that is water is (15/30) * 100% = 50%.

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"Mei can run four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is 1/2 as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 10 hours if she spends 2/5 of the time running, 1/2 of the time skipping, and the remaining of the time walking?",27.0,"To solve this problem, we'll first find Mei's speed when walking and running, then calculate how far she can travel in 10 hours.

Since Mei skips at a rate of 2 miles per hour, and this is 1/2 as fast as she can run, we can multiply 2 miles per hour by 2 to get her running speed:
2 miles per hour * 2 = 4 miles per hour (running speed)

We know Mei can run four times faster than she can walk, so to find her walking speed, we can divide her running speed by 4:
4 miles per hour (running speed) / 4 = 1 mile per hour (walking speed)

Now that we have her speed for walking, running, and skipping, we can calculate how far she can travel in 10 hours. We'll first find out how much time she spends on each activity:
- Time running: 2/5 of 10 hours = 4 hours
- Time skipping: 1/2 of 10 hours = 5 hours
- Time walking: 10 hours - 4 hours - 5 hours = 1 hour

Now we can calculate how far she travels in each activity:
- Distance running: 4 miles per hour * 4 hours = 16 miles
- Distance skipping: 2 miles per hour * 5 hours = 10 miles
- Distance walking: 1 mile per hour * 1 hour = 1 mile

Finally, we can add the distances to find out how far she can travel in 10 hours:
16 miles + 10 miles + 1 mile = 27 miles

So, Mei can travel 27 miles in 10 hours.",10.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
Mei skips at 2 miles per hour.
She can run at a rate 4 times as fast as her walking speed, and her skipping speed is 1/2 of her running speed, so her running speed is 2 * 2 = 4 miles per hour. 
Since her running speed is 4 times as fast as her walking speed, her walking speed is 4 / 4 = 1 miles per hour.

She spends 2/5 of the time running, so the distance covered while running is 4 * (2/5 * 10) = 4 * 4 = 16 miles.
She spends 1/2 of the time skipping, so the distance covered while skipping is 2 * (1/2 * 10) = 2 * 5 = 10 miles.
She spends the remaining time (1 - 2/5 - 1/2) = 1/10 of the time walking, so the distance covered while walking is 1 * (1/10 * 10) = 1 * 1 = 1 miles.

The total distance is 16 + 10 + 1 = 27 miles.

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has 200 calories per serving. If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?",180.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the remaining daily calorie target**

You have a daily calorie target of 2300 calories. You've already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories, which means you've burned an additional 100 calories. To calculate the remaining calorie target, subtract the calories consumed and burned from the daily target:

2300 (daily target) - 1200 (calories consumed) - 100 (calories burned) = 1000 calories remaining

**Step 2: Calculate the calories per ounce of cookies**

The bag of cookies has 200 calories per serving, and there are 5 servings in a 150 oz bag. To calculate the calories per ounce, divide the calories per serving by the number of ounces per serving:

200 calories/serving ÷ (150 oz ÷ 5 servings) = 200 calories/serving ÷ 30 oz/serving = approximately 6.67 calories/oz

**Step 3: Calculate the number of ounces you can eat**

Now, divide the remaining daily calorie target by the calories per ounce of cookies:

1000 calories remaining ÷ 6.67 calories/oz ≈ 150 oz

However, this is the total number of ounces you can eat to reach your daily calorie target. Since you want to know how many ounces you can eat from the 150 oz bag, we don't need to do any further calculations. You can eat up to 150 oz from the bag, but this would use up all your remaining daily calorie target. If you want to save some calories for other foods, you can eat a portion of the 150 oz.

To be more precise, let's calculate the maximum number of ounces you can eat while leaving some calories for other foods. For example, if you want to leave 200 calories for other foods, you can eat:

(1000 - 200) calories remaining ÷ 6.67 calories/oz ≈ 120 oz

So, you can eat up to 120 oz from the 150 oz bag, leaving 200 calories for other foods.",200.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories are left in your daily target. 
You have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories, which means you have burned 100 calories.
So, the net calories consumed is 1200 - 100 = 1100 calories.
Your daily target is 2300 calories.
So, the remaining calories you can consume is 2300 - 1100 = 1200 calories.

Now, we need to find out how many calories are in the bag of cookies.
The bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 200 calories.
So, the total calories in the bag is 5 * 200 = 1000 calories.

Since you can only consume 1200 calories more, and the bag has 1000 calories, you can eat the whole bag, but you will be left with 1200 - 1000 = 200 calories for other foods.

Now, we need to find out how many oz you can eat from the bag.
The bag has 150 oz, and you can eat the whole bag, but you will be left with 200 calories for other foods.
So, you can eat 150 oz, but to be precise, you can eat 150 oz * (1000 / 1000) = 150 oz * (1200 / 1200) = 150 oz * (1000 / 1200) = 125 oz.

However, this is not the correct way to calculate the oz you can eat. We should calculate the oz per calorie first.
The bag has 150 oz and 1000 calories.
So, the oz per calorie is 150 oz / 1000 calories = 0.15 oz per calorie.

Now, we can calculate the oz you can eat.
You can consume 1200 calories more, and you want to eat cookies.
So, you can eat 1200 calories / 200 calories per serving = 6 servings, but you only have 5 servings.
So, you can eat 5 servings, which is 5 * 200 = 1000 calories.
Now, we can calculate the oz you can eat.
The oz you can eat is 1000 calories * 0.15 oz per calorie = 150 oz.

However, this is still not the correct answer. We should calculate the oz you can eat based on the calories you can consume.
You can consume 1200 calories more, and the cookies have 200 calories per serving.
So, you can eat 1200 calories / 200 calories per serving = 6 servings, but you only have 5 servings.
So, you can eat 5 servings, which is 5 * 200 = 1000 calories.
You can consume 1200 calories more, and you will eat 1000 calories.
So, you will be left with 1200 - 1000 = 200 calories.
The oz you can eat is 150 oz * (1000 / 1000) = 150 oz * (1200 / 1200) = 150 oz * (1000 / 1200) = 125 oz.

The answer is 125.",125.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories are left in the daily target.
The daily calorie target is 2300.
You have already consumed 1200 calories.
You also exercised for 100 calories, which means you burned 100 calories.
So, the net calories consumed is 1200 - 100 = 1100.
The remaining calories allowed is 2300 - 1100 = 1200.

Since the bag of cookies has 200 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat within the remaining calorie limit.
The remaining calories allowed is 1200.
Each serving has 200 calories.
So, the number of servings you can eat is 1200 / 200 = 6.

However, the question asks for the number of oz you can eat, not the number of servings.
The bag has 5 servings and weighs 150 oz.
So, the weight of each serving is 150 / 5 = 30 oz.
Since you can eat 6 servings, the total weight of cookies you can eat is 6 * 30 = 180 oz.

But wait, the bag only has 150 oz, so you can't eat 180 oz.
You can only eat up to 150 oz, but we need to find out how many oz you can eat within the 6 servings limit.
Since you can eat 6 servings and each serving is 30 oz, but the bag only has 150 oz, we need to recalculate the number of oz you can eat.
You can eat 5 servings (since the bag only has 5 servings) which is 5 * 30 = 150 oz, but you can only eat 6 servings worth of calories, which is less than 150 oz.
Let's calculate the oz for 6 servings worth of calories: 6 servings * 30 oz/serving is not possible since the bag only has 150 oz, so we need to calculate the oz for the remaining calories: 1200 calories / 200 calories/serving = 6 servings, but the bag only has 5 servings, so we can only eat 5 servings which is 150 oz, but we need to eat less than 150 oz to stay within the calorie limit.

On Saturday and Sunday, he watched 4-hour episodes each night. That's 2 * 4 = 8 hours.

On Tuesday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. We need to convert 45 minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 45 minutes is 45 / 60 = 0.75 hours. So, on Tuesday, he watched 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.

1. The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 63:14.
2. The ratio of tablespoons of milk to cups of water is 9:7.
3. The total amount of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk used is 760.

To solve this problem, we can start by finding the total amount of cups of water used. We can do this by first finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 14 and 7, which is 14. 

Since the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 63:14, and the ratio of tablespoons of milk to cups of water is 9:7, we can rewrite these ratios as 63:14 and 18:14, respectively.

Now, we can add the three parts of the ratio: 63 + 14 + 18 = 95. This means that for every 95 parts of the mixture, 63 parts are teaspoons of sugar, 14 parts are cups of water, and 18 parts are tablespoons of milk.

We are told that the total amount of the mixture is 760. To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar, we can set up a proportion:

63/95 = x/760

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

63 × 760 = 95x

47880 = 95x

Now, we can divide both sides by 95:

x = 47880 / 95

Fatima uses teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 63:14.
She also uses 9 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water.
This means that for every 14 cups of water, she uses 9 * 2 = 18 tablespoons of milk, since 14 = 7 * 2.
The total ratio is now 63:14:18 (sugar:water:milk).
Let's add these up: 63 + 14 + 18 = 95.
The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk is 760.
This means that 95 parts make up 760.
To find out how many parts are in 1 unit, we divide 760 by 95: 760 / 95 = 8.
So, each part is equal to 8 units.
Now, we can find out how many teaspoons of sugar Fatima used by multiplying the number of sugar parts (63) by the number of units per part (8).

If Isabella hires a financial advisor, she will not lose any consulting time, but she will have to pay the advisor's fee of ₣82. 

To find the difference in how much money she will have, we subtract the advisor's fee from the total loss of income:

If Isabella does her taxes herself, she'll lose 12 hours of consulting work, which means she'll lose 12 * ₣82 = ₣984 in missed income.

Additionally, she'll spend 3 hours mailing the completed tax documents, which means she'll lose 3 * ₣82 = ₣246 in missed income.

So, the total amount of money she'll lose if she does her taxes herself is ₣984 + ₣246 = ₣1230.

If she hires a financial advisor, she'll pay ₣82.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row?,43.75,"To find the probability that Luis rolls a number greater than 10 on a 20-sided die, we first count how many numbers are greater than 10.

There are 10 numbers greater than 10 on a 20-sided die: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is the number of favorable outcomes (10) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (20):

Probability = 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5

Now, let's find the probability that Luis rolls four odd numbers in a row. The probability of rolling an odd number on a 20-sided die is 10/20, since there are 10 odd numbers. 

The probability of rolling an odd number four times in a row is the product of the individual probabilities, since the rolls are independent:

Probability = (10/20) * (10/20) * (10/20) * (10/20) = (1/2)^4 = 1/16 = 0.0625

Now, we compare the two probabilities:

Probability of rolling a number greater than 10: 0.5
Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row: 0.0625

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the smaller probability from the larger probability:

Difference = 0.5 - 0.0625 = 0.4375

To express this difference as a percentage, we convert the decimal to a percentage:

Difference percentage = 0.4375 * 100% ≈ 43.75%

So, it is approximately 43.75% more likely that Luis rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row.",10.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 on a 20-sided die.
There are 10 numbers greater than 10 (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20) out of 20 possible outcomes.
So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is 10/20 = 0.5 or 50%.

Next, we need to calculate the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row.
The probability of rolling an odd number on a 20-sided die is 10/20 = 0.5, since there are 10 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19) out of 20 possible outcomes.
Since we're rolling the die four times, we need to multiply the probability of rolling an odd number each time:
(0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.0625 or 6.25%.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities:
50% - 6.25% = 43.75%

So, it is 43.75% more likely that Luis rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row.

We know that Liam found 64 rabbits, 36 grasshoppers, and 24 ants. We also know that there were 1/6 as many ladybugs as ants, so we can calculate the number of ladybugs as follows:

Number of ladybugs = (1/6) x Number of ants

Now, we can find the total number of animals in the plot by adding up the number of rabbits, grasshoppers, ants, and ladybugs:

Total number of animals = 64 + 36 + 24 + 4

Next, we can find the percentage of animals that were rabbits by dividing the number of rabbits by the total number of animals and multiplying by 100:

1. Yuki was a pen pal with 8 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 4 of them. So, he is now a pen pal with:

8 - 4 = 4 people

2. Each of these 4 people sends 3 letters a week, and Yuki responds in kind. So, the total number of letters exchanged per week is:

4 people x 3 letters/week x 2 (since Yuki responds in kind) = 24 letters/week

3. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of letters exchanged per day is:

24 letters/week ÷ 7 days/week = 3.43 letters/day (approximately)

4. Each letter is 10 pages long, so the total number of pages exchanged per day is:

3.43 letters/day x 10 pages/letter = 34.3 pages/day

5. Yuki can write a page every 14 minutes. To find the total time spent writing per day, we can multiply the number of pages by the time it takes to write one page:

34.3 pages/day x 14 minutes/page = 480.2 minutes/day

6. Finally, we can convert the total time spent writing per day from minutes to hours:

So, the total number of letters he writes in a week is 4 * 3 = 12 letters.

Each letter is 10 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes in a week is 12 * 10 = 120 pages.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the average number of pages he writes in a day is 120 / 7 = 17.14 pages (approximately).

It takes him 14 minutes to write a page, so the average time he spends writing in a day is 17.14 * 14 = 240 minutes.

Profit = Total value - Initial cost
= ¥1,395 - ¥960
= ¥435

Therefore, Ananya made a profit of ¥435 by the end of the third year.",435.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Ananya buys 12 shares of a stock for ¥80 each.
So, the total cost of the shares is 12 * ¥80 = ¥960.

In the first year, the stock price increases by 55%.
The new price is ¥80 + (¥80 * 0.55) = ¥80 + ¥44 = ¥124.
So, the total value of the shares after the first year is 12 * ¥124 = ¥1488.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%.
The new price is ¥124 - (¥124 * 0.25) = ¥124 - ¥31 = ¥93.
So, the total value of the shares after the second year is 12 * ¥93 = ¥1116.

In the third year, the stock price increases by 25%.
The new price is ¥93 + (¥93 * 0.25) = ¥93 + ¥23.25 = ¥116.25.
So, the total value of the shares after the third year is 12 * ¥116.25 = ¥1395.

To find the profit, we need to subtract the initial cost from the final value.
The profit is ¥1395 - ¥960 = ¥435.

The roller coaster costs €10 per ride. For the transportation of the birthday party guests, Emma needs to rent a bus for the day, which costs €60. How many friends can she invite?
A: Let's think step by step.
The cost of bus transportation is €60.
This leaves Emma with a budget of €180 - €60 = €120 for other activities.
Each person (Emma and her friends) will do the following activities:
- Play one round of laser tag for €6.
- Get €4 in pinball tokens.
- Ride the roller coaster three times for €10 * 3 = €30.
The total cost per person is €6 + €4 + €30 = €40.
Since Emma also needs to participate in the activities, the total cost for her and her friends is €40 * (number of friends + 1).
The total budget for activities is €120.
So, €40 * (number of friends + 1) = €120.
Divide both sides by €40: number of friends + 1 = €120 / €40 = 3.
Subtract 1 from both sides: number of friends = 3 - 1 = 2.
However, since the question asks how many friends Emma can invite, we need to make sure the total cost doesn't exceed €120. If Emma invites 2 friends, the total cost would be €40 * 3 = €120, which exactly equals the budget.

**Step 1: Find the total number of fourth-grade boys**

We know there are 80 fourth-graders in total, and 34 of them are girls. To find the number of boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total:

80 (total) - 34 (girls) = 46 (boys)

Area = w * l

Now, we can expand the equation:

Rearranging the equation to make it a quadratic equation:

Now we know the number of pink and red cards. The number of purple cards is the sum of the number of pink and red cards:

 Purple cards = Pink cards + Red cards
= 30 + 51
= 81

Now we have the total number of cards of each color:
- Pink cards: 30
- Red cards: 51
- Purple cards: 81

To find the average number of cards per color, we divide the total number of cards by 3 (the number of colors):

Total number of cards = 30 + 51 + 81 = 162

Average number of cards per color = Total number of cards / 3

There are 30 pink cards.
The number of red cards is 70% more than the number of pink cards.

So, the number of red cards is 30 + 21 = 51.
The number of purple cards is the sum of pink and red cards, which is 30 + 51 = 81.
To find the average number of cards per color, we add the number of cards of each color and divide by 3.
The total number of cards is 30 + 51 + 81 = 162.
The average number of cards per color is 162 / 3 = 54.

**Step 1: Find the total number of puppies**

Olivia's dog has 148 puppies.
Gabriel's dog has 62 puppies.
Santiago has 62 dogs, each having 10 puppies, so he has a total of 62 x 10 = 620 puppies.

Total number of puppies = 148 + 62 + 620 = 830

**Step 2: Find the total number of puppies with spots**

Olivia's dog has 28 puppies with spots.
Gabriel's dog has 16 puppies with spots.
Santiago has 62 dogs, each having 10 puppies with spots, so he has a total of 62 x 10 = 620 puppies with spots.

Apples are the main diet of his alpacas, so he buys thirty three 43-kg packs. Wheat are a staple to supplement the apples, so he buys eighteen 19-kg sacks.

* Carrots: 11 bags x 9 kg/bag = 99 kg
* Apples: 33 packs x 43 kg/pack = 1419 kg

First, we need to find the total length of the remoras that are attached to the shark. Each remora is 15 inches long, and there are 15 remoras initially.
So, the total length of the remoras is 15 * 15 = 225 inches.

Since 1/5 of the remoras go away, we need to find 1/5 of 15 remoras.
1/5 of 15 is 15 / 5 = 3 remoras.

So, 3 remoras go away, leaving 15 - 3 = 12 remoras.

The total length of the remaining remoras is 12 * 15 = 180 inches.

**Step 1: Find out how many tubes of pink paint Yuki has**

Yuki has 2/4 as many tubes of pink paint as Sanjay. Since Sanjay has 10 tubes of pink paint, we can calculate Yuki's tubes as follows:

Yuki's pink tubes = (2/4) × Sanjay's pink tubes
= (2/4) × 10
= 0.5 × 10
= 5

So, Yuki has 5 tubes of pink paint.

**Step 2: Find out how many tubes of blue paint Yuki has**

Yuki has thrice as many tubes of blue paint as Sanjay. Since Sanjay has 3 tubes of blue paint, we can calculate Yuki's tubes as follows:

Yuki's blue tubes = 3 × Sanjay's blue tubes
= 3 × 3
= 9

So, Yuki has 9 tubes of blue paint.

**Step 3: Find out how many tubes of pink paint Sanjay and Yuki have combined**

Sanjay has 10 tubes of pink paint, and Yuki has 5 tubes of pink paint. So, the combined number of pink tubes is:

Combined pink tubes = Sanjay's pink tubes + Yuki's pink tubes
= 10 + 5
= 15

**Step 4: Find out how many tubes of black paint Andre has**

Andre has six times as many tubes of black paint as the combined number of pink tubes that Sanjay and Yuki have. So, we can calculate Andre's black tubes as follows:

Andre's black tubes = 6 × Combined pink tubes

= 90

So, Andre has 90 tubes of black paint.

**Step 5: Find out how many tubes of blue paint Sanjay and Yuki have combined**

1. The child has 13 marbles.
2. His friend has 2 fewer marbles than two times what the child has. To find out how many marbles the friend has, we need to multiply the number of marbles the child has by 2, and then subtract 2.

Let's do that:

2 x 13 = 26 (two times what the child has)
26 - 2 = 24 (2 fewer marbles than two times what the child has)

So, the friend has 24 marbles.

3. To find out how many marbles they have together, we need to add the number of marbles the child has to the number of marbles the friend has:

What is the total weekly production for the three if they work all days of the week?",840.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote Emma's speed as x customers per day. Since Nadia operates exactly 9 times as fast as Emma, Nadia's speed is 9x customers per day.

2. Uma's speed is the average of Emma's and Nadia's speeds. To find the average, we add Emma's and Nadia's speeds and divide by 2:

Uma's speed = (x + 9x) / 2
Uma's speed = 10x / 2
Uma's speed = 5x customers per day

3. We are given that Emma processes 8 customers per day. So, we can set up the equation:

x = 8

4. Now that we know Emma's speed, we can find Nadia's and Uma's speeds:

Nadia's speed = 9x = 9(8) = 72 customers per day
Uma's speed = 5x = 5(8) = 40 customers per day

5. To find the total daily production, we add the number of customers processed by each of them:

Total daily production = Emma's production + Nadia's production + Uma's production
= 8 + 72 + 40
= 120 customers per day

6. To find the total weekly production, we multiply the total daily production by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

1. Goats:
Each goat needs 9 kilograms of grain.
There are 21 goats, so the total amount of grain needed for goats is:
21 goats × 9 kilograms/goat = 189 kilograms

2. Alpacas:
Each alpaca needs 3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs.
Twice the amount each goat needs is 2 × 9 kilograms = 18 kilograms.
3 kilograms less than that is 18 kilograms - 3 kilograms = 15 kilograms.

Now, let's add up the total amount of grain needed for all the animals:

Alejandro needs 798 kilograms of grain to feed his livestock.",798.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how much grain each alpaca needs. Since each alpaca needs 3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 9 kilograms, we can calculate the amount for each alpaca as follows:
2 * 9 = 18 (twice the amount each goat needs)
18 - 3 = 15 (3 kilograms less)

So, each alpaca needs 15 kilograms of grain.

Next, we need to find out how much grain each cow needs. Since each cow eats as much as a goat and alpaca eat combined, we can calculate the amount for each cow as follows:

Due to the flu season, 35 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.",50.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of occupied beds**

The hospital has a capacity of 800 beds, and 1/8 of them are occupied. To find the number of occupied beds, we'll multiply the total capacity by 1/8:

Occupied beds = 800 x 1/8 = 800 x 0.125 = 100 beds

**Step 2: Calculate the number of beds out of service**

One-fifth of all the beds are out of service. To find the number of beds out of service, we'll multiply the total capacity by 1/5:

Beds out of service = 800 x 1/5 = 800 x 0.2 = 160 beds

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of unavailable beds**

We'll add the number of occupied beds and beds out of service to find the total number of unavailable beds:

Unavailable beds = Occupied beds + Beds out of service
= 100 + 160
= 260 beds

**Step 4: Calculate the initial number of unoccupied beds**

We'll subtract the number of unavailable beds from the total capacity to find the initial number of unoccupied beds:

Initial unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Unavailable beds
= 800 - 260
= 540 beds

**Step 5: Calculate the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks**

The hospital admits 35 patients per day. To find the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks, we'll multiply the daily admission rate by the number of days in 2 weeks (14 days):

Patients admitted in 2 weeks = 35 patients/day x 14 days
= 490 patients

**Step 6: Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks**

We'll subtract the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks from the initial number of unoccupied beds:

Total unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = Initial unoccupied beds - Patients admitted in 2 weeks
= 540 - 490
= 50 beds

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 50 beds.",50.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The hospital has a capacity of 800 beds.
1/8 of the beds are occupied, which is 800 * 1/8 = 100 beds.

Additionally, one-fifth of all the beds are out of service, which is 800 * 1/5 = 160 beds.
So, the number of unoccupied and available beds is 700 - 160 = 540 beds.

Due to the flu season, 35 patients are admitted into the hospital each day.
In 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted is 35 * 14 = 490 patients.

Let's break it down step by step:

**Monday:**

* Cupcakes: 24 boxes
* Orange pies: 16 fewer than Tuesday, so we'll come back to this later

**Tuesday:**

* Cupcakes: 11 more than Monday, so 24 + 11 = 35 boxes
* Orange pies: 28 boxes

Now, let's go back to Monday's orange pie sales. Since Andre sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pie on Monday than on Tuesday, we can set up an equation:

Monday's orange pie sales = Tuesday's orange pie sales - 16
= 28 - 16

So, on Monday, Andre sold 12 boxes of orange pie.

**Wednesday:**

* Cupcakes: same as Monday and Tuesday combined = 24 + 35 = 59 boxes
* Orange pies: same as Monday and Tuesday combined = 12 + 28 = 40 boxes

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

**Monday:**

* Cupcakes: 24 boxes × ₺10 = ₺240
* Orange pies: 12 boxes × ₺22 = ₺264

On Tuesday, Andre sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday, which is 24 + 11 = 35 boxes of cupcakes.
On Tuesday, he sold 28 boxes of orange pie.

Now, we can find out how many boxes of orange pie Andre sold on Monday.
Since he sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pie on Monday than on Tuesday, he sold 28 - 16 = 12 boxes of orange pie on Monday.

On Tuesday, he sold 35 boxes of cupcakes and 28 boxes of orange pie.
On Monday, he sold 24 boxes of cupcakes and 12 boxes of orange pie.

Now, we can find out how many boxes of cupcakes and orange pie Andre sold on Wednesday.
On Wednesday, he sold as many as he did in the past two days combined.
So, the number of boxes of cupcakes sold on Wednesday is 24 + 35 = 59 boxes.
The number of boxes of orange pie sold on Wednesday is 12 + 28 = 40 boxes.

Now, we can find out the total number of boxes of cupcakes and orange pie Andre sold in three days.
Total number of boxes of cupcakes is 24 + 35 + 59 = 118 boxes.
Total number of boxes of orange pie is 12 + 28 + 40 = 80 boxes.

Now, we can find out the total amount of money Andre earned in three days.
Each cupcake costs ₺10, so the total amount of money earned from cupcakes is 118 * 10 = 1180.
Each orange pie costs ₺22, so the total amount of money earned from orange pie is 80 * 22 = 1760.
The total amount of money earned is 1180 + 1760 = 2940.

Now, we can find out Andre's average daily earnings.
The average daily earnings is the total amount of money earned divided by the number of days.

So, the number of volleyball players is 125 * 0.24 = 30.

However, half of the volleyball players are absent for being sick.
So, the number of volleyball players leaving early is 30 / 2 = 15.

Next, we need to find out how many students are robotics club members or choir members.
The remaining class after removing volleyball players is 125 - 30 = 95.
40% of the remaining class are robotics club members or choir members.
So, the number of robotics club members or choir members is 95 * 0.40 = 38.

Now, we need to add the number of volleyball players, robotics club members, and choir members to find the total number of students leaving early.
The total number of students leaving early is 15 (volleyball players) + 38 (robotics club members and choir members) = 53.

Finally, we need to add the 3 cheerleaders accompanying each group.

Mei's flower bed is 143 feet long.
Each plant takes up 3 feet (its width) and needs 13 feet of space between it and the next plant.
So, the total space taken up by each plant is 3 + 13 = 16 feet.
Mei already has 8 flowers, so she needs to fill the remaining space.
The total space available is 143 feet.
The space taken up by the 8 flowers she already has is 8 * 16 = 128 feet.
However, this is not correct, since the 8 flowers she already has will take up 8 * 3 = 24 feet for the flowers themselves, and 7 * 13 = 91 feet for the spaces between them (since there are 7 spaces between 8 flowers).
So, the total space taken up by the 8 flowers she already has is 24 + 91 = 115 feet.
The remaining space is 143 - 115 = 28 feet.
Since each plant takes up 16 feet of space, Mei can fit 28 / 16 = 1.75 plants in the remaining space.
However, Mei can't buy a fraction of a plant, so she'll need to buy 2 more plants to fill the remaining space.

A: Let's think step by step.
Mei's flower bed is 143 feet long.
Each plant will occupy 3 feet (its width) + 13 feet (space between plants, including the plant's width itself is not added) = 16 feet.
To find out how many plants Mei can fit in her flower bed, we need to divide the total length by the space each plant occupies: 143 feet / 16 feet = 8.9375. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, Mei can fit 8 plants in her flower bed, but she already has 8, however, she will need two more plants to be eligible for the discount on the entire purchase (the fact she only needs 1 plant is not considered). 
However, Mei already has enough plants to fill her bed, she actually needs only 1 more plant to fill the flower bed (but this is not considered) but to get a discount, she needs to buy 3 more plants (2+1).

1. Washing the clams: This takes 19 minutes.

2. Peeling the clams: Yara can peel 6 clams per minute. To peel 60 clams, it will take her:
   60 clams / 6 clams/minute = 10 minutes

   3 sets * 8 minutes/set = 24 minutes

Now we add up the time for each step:
- Washing: 19 minutes
- Peeling: 10 minutes

**Step 1: Calculate the number of emails that don't require a response**

16% of 150 emails don't require a response. To calculate this, we'll multiply 150 by 0.16 (which is equivalent to 16%).

Sophia can respond to 11 less than half of the emails that require a response. To calculate this, we'll first find half of 126:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces Uma finished in the first puzzle**

Uma finished one-fifth of a 420 piece puzzle. To find the number of pieces she finished, we need to multiply 420 by 1/5.

420 x 1/5 = 420 ÷ 5 = 84

So, Uma finished 84 pieces of the first puzzle.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces Uma finished in the second puzzle**

Uma finished one-tenth of a 430 piece puzzle. To find the number of pieces she finished, we need to multiply 430 by 1/10.

430 x 1/10 = 430 ÷ 10 = 43

So, Uma finished 43 pieces of the second puzzle.

Let's start with Ananya's share. We don't know how much Ananya gets, so let's call it ""x"".

Since Tara gets 190 yards more than Ananya, Tara's share is x + 190.

Umar gets 30 yards more than Tara, so Umar's share is (x + 190) + 30, which is x + 220.

The total amount of fence is 860 yards, and it is split between Ananya, Tara, and Umar. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 190) + (x + 220) = 860

Umar gets 30 yards more than Tara, so Umar gets (x + 190) + 30 = x + 220 yards.

The total amount of fence is the sum of what each person gets: x + (x + 190) + (x + 220) = 860.

Combine like terms: 3x + 410 = 860.

Subtract 410 from both sides: 3x = 450.

On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?",75.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Find Olivia's original speed on the beach and sidewalk**

Let's denote Olivia's original speed on the beach as x km/min. Since she walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her original speed on the sidewalk is 4x km/min.

**Step 2: Calculate Olivia's new speed on the beach and sidewalk after the injury**

Since Olivia's speed has decreased by half due to the injury, her new speed on the beach is x/2 km/min, and her new speed on the sidewalk is 4x/2 = 2x km/min.

**Step 3: Calculate the time spent walking on the beach**

We know that Olivia spends 60 minutes walking on the beach, and she covers a distance of 10 kilometers. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Substituting the values, we get:

60 = 10 / (x/2)

Simplifying, we get:

x/2 = 10/60
x/2 = 1/6
x = 1/3

So, Olivia's original speed on the beach is 1/3 km/min.

**Step 4: Calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk**

Now that we know Olivia's original speed on the beach, we can find her original speed on the sidewalk, which is 4x = 4(1/3) = 4/3 km/min.

Since her speed has decreased by half, her new speed on the sidewalk is 2x = 2(1/3) = 2/3 km/min.

The distance covered on the sidewalk is 10 kilometers. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Substituting the values, we get:

Time = 10 / (2/3)
Time = 10 × 3/2
Time = 15 minutes

**Step 5: Calculate the total time spent walking**

Olivia spends 60 minutes walking on the beach and 15 minutes walking on the sidewalk. Therefore, the total time spent walking is:

Total Time = 60 + 15
Total Time = 75 minutes

The final answer is: 75",75.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Olivia walks a total of 20 kilometers, with 10 kilometers on the beach and 10 kilometers on the sidewalk.

We know she spends 60 minutes walking on the beach, which is 10 kilometers. To find her speed on the beach, we can divide the distance by the time:
10 kilometers / 60 minutes = 1/6 kilometers per minute (initial speed on the beach).

However, due to her injury, her speed has decreased by half:
1/6 kilometers per minute * 1/2 = 1/12 kilometers per minute (new speed on the beach).

Since she walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, we can multiply the new speed on the beach by 4 to get her speed on the sidewalk:
1/12 kilometers per minute * 4 = 1/3 kilometers per minute (speed on the sidewalk).

Now, her speed on the sidewalk has also decreased by half due to the injury:
1/3 kilometers per minute * 1/2 = 1/6 kilometers per minute (new speed on the sidewalk).

Since Olivia walks 10 kilometers on the sidewalk at this new speed, we can find the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk:
10 kilometers / (1/6 kilometers per minute) = 10 * 6 = 60 minutes.

However, this is not her new speed on the sidewalk after the injury. Her new speed on the sidewalk is 1/3 kilometers per minute * 1/2 = 1/6 kilometers per minute.

So the time it takes her to walk 10 kilometers on the sidewalk at this new speed is:
10 kilometers / (1/3 kilometers per minute * 1/2) = 10 kilometers / (1/6 kilometers per minute) = 10 * 6 = 60 minutes.",60.0,0,"Q: Olivia walks 20 kilometers every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 kilometers of walking on the beach and 10 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?
A: Let's think step by step.
Olivia walks 10 kilometers on the beach.
She spends 60 minutes walking on the beach.
So, her speed on the beach is 10 km / 60 minutes = 1/6 km/min.

Since her speed decreased by half due to injury, her original speed on the beach would have been 2 * 1/6 km/min = 1/3 km/min.

On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach.
So, her original speed on the sidewalk would have been 4 * 1/3 km/min = 4/3 km/min.

However, her speed decreased by half due to injury, so her current speed on the sidewalk is 4/3 km/min / 2 = 2/3 km/min.

She walks 10 kilometers on the sidewalk at a speed of 2/3 km/min.
So, the time taken to walk on the sidewalk is 10 km / (2/3 km/min) = 10 * (3/2) minutes = 15 minutes.

The total time taken for the entire 20-kilometer walk is the time on the beach plus the time on the sidewalk.
So, the total time is 60 minutes + 15 minutes = 75 minutes.

However, this is the same answer that was previously incorrect. Let's re-examine the calculation.

The correct total time should be based on the actual speeds after the injury. The beach speed was correctly calculated as 1/6 km/min. The sidewalk speed was correctly calculated as 2/3 km/min after the injury.

She walks 10 kilometers on the sidewalk at a speed of 2/3 km/min.
So, the time taken to walk on the sidewalk is 10 km / (2/3 km/min) = 10 * (3/2) minutes = 15 minutes.

And she walks 10 kilometers on the beach at a speed of 1/6 km/min.
So, the time taken to walk on the beach is given as 60 minutes.

However, we need to find the actual time it would take her to walk 10 kilometers at her reduced speed of 1/6 km/min. 
To do this, we set up a proportion and use the given 60 minutes for 10 kilometers:
10 km / 60 min = 1/6 km/min 

Let's find her speed on the beach before the injury, which was 2 * 1/6 km/min = 1/3 km/min. 
The correct time for 10 kilometers at her reduced speed of 1/6 km/min is indeed 60 minutes. The speed didn't seem the issue.

However, let's correctly calculate the sidewalk's time using the correct proportion method.
We set up a proportion and use the given sidewalk speed of 4/3 km/min. 
However, this speed was before the injury. The correct sidewalk speed is 2/3 km/min.

Let's find the time for the sidewalk correctly using ratios. Since she has a speed of 2/3 km/min, and we know the time for the beach, we should compare speeds instead of kilometers.
The ratio of speeds is (1/6 km/min) / (2/3 km/min).
The ratio of times will be (2/3 km/min) / (1/6 km/min), which is 4:1.

The time spent on the sidewalk is 60 minutes / 4 = 15 minutes.

However, there is a correct solution based on her actual speeds, and the total distance.
Let's start again from the beginning.

Olivia walks 10 kilometers on the beach.
She spends 60 minutes walking on the beach.
So, her speed on the beach is 10 km / 60 minutes = 1/6 km/min.

She walks 10 kilometers on the sidewalk at a speed of 4 times the beach speed, but reduced by half.
So, her speed on the sidewalk is (4 * 1/6 km/min) / 2 = 2/3 km/min * (1/2) * 2 = 1/3 km/min * 2 = 2/3 km/min.

However, we already know her sidewalk speed is 2/3 km/min.

Let's find the correct time.
Since Olivia spends 60 minutes on the beach, she spends 60 minutes * (2/3 km/min) / (1/6 km/min) = 60 minutes * 4 = 240 minutes / 4 = 60 minutes.

The sidewalk's time is based on a ratio of speeds, so the sidewalk's time is 60 minutes / 4 = 15 minutes.

However, we notice the sidewalk's time isn't the issue, and we didn't consider a few aspects.

Let's consider her reduced speed and time on both the beach and the sidewalk.
Olivia walks 10 kilometers on the beach.
She spends 60 minutes walking on the beach.
So, her speed on the beach is 10 km / 60 minutes = 1/6 km/min.

She walks 10 kilometers on the sidewalk at a speed of 4 times the beach speed, but reduced by half.
So, her speed on the sidewalk is (4 * 1/6 km/min) / 2 = 1/3 km/min * 2 = 2/3 km/min / 2 * 2 = 1/3 km/min * 2 = 2/3 km/min.

However, we already know her sidewalk speed is indeed 2/3 km/min after the injury, but her original sidewalk speed was 4/3 km/min.

However, let's re-calculate everything, since the issue seems to be with proportions and ratios.

We know her speed on the beach is 1/6 km/min after the injury.
We know her speed on the sidewalk is 2/3 km/min after the injury.

Let's calculate the time it would take her to walk the 10 kilometers on the sidewalk at a speed of 2/3 km/min.

The time taken to walk on the sidewalk is 10 km / (2/3 km/min) = 10 * (3/2) minutes = 15 minutes.

We should calculate the total time for both the beach and the sidewalk.
However, her speed on the beach was given, and her time on the beach was given as 60 minutes.

Since Olivia spends 60 minutes on the beach, we should calculate her original time on the beach, before the injury.
Her speed on the beach before the injury was indeed 1/3 km/min (twice the reduced speed of 1/6 km/min).

However, we are given the time on the beach, which is 60 minutes.
We know her speed on the beach is 1/6 km/min after the injury.
We should calculate the total time based on her reduced speeds.

Since we have the correct speeds, we can calculate the time for the sidewalk.
However, we notice that we didn't consider her original speed before the injury.

We are given the time on the beach, which is 60 minutes.
We know her speed on the beach is 1/6 km/min after the injury.
We should calculate the time for the sidewalk.

However, we notice that her time on the sidewalk isn't the issue.
The issue is the total time for the entire walk.

Since we know her speed on the beach and her speed on the sidewalk, we should calculate the total time.
However, we should calculate the time for the sidewalk correctly.

He eats 9 pancakes a day for the rest of the days, which is 70 - 57 = 13 days. 
The total number of pancakes he eats in 13 days is:
13 * 9 = 117

The total number of pancakes he eats in 70 days is:
171 + 117 = 288

Arjun eats 3 pancakes a day for 57 days, so the total number of pancakes he eats in the first 57 days is:

After 57 days, there are 70 - 57 = 13 days left.

Arjun increases his pancake consumption to 9 pancakes a day for the remaining 13 days:

1. Esteban hid 11 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, Esteban hid 11 x 12 = 132 eggs.

2. James finds 4 eggs.

3. Tara finds five times as many as James: 5 x 4 = 20 eggs.

4. Winnie finds 4 less than Tara: 20 - 4 = 16 eggs.

5. Noah finds half as many as Winnie: 16 / 2 = 8 eggs.

6. Oscar finds four dozen eggs more than Tara and James combined. 
   First, find the total number of eggs Tara and James found: 20 + 4 = 24 eggs.

How much money does he make in a week?,1539.0,"To find Oliver's weekly earnings, we'll break down the problem into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the first 2 complexes**
Each complex has 300 apartments, so the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes is:
300 + 300 = 600 apartments

**Step 2: Calculate the number of apartments in the 3rd complex**
The 3rd complex is 50% bigger than the other 2 combined. To find the number of apartments in the 3rd complex, we'll calculate 50% of 600 and add it to 600:
50% of 600 = 0.5 * 600 = 300
Number of apartments in the 3rd complex = 600 + 300 = 900 apartments

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of apartments**
Total number of apartments = 600 (from the first 2 complexes) + 900 (from the 3rd complex) = 1500 apartments

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of collections per week**
Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each apartment complex, so the total number of collections per week is:
2 collections/week * 3 complexes = 6 collections/week (but this is for each apartment, so we can simplify to) 
2 collections/week * 1500 apartments = 3000 collections/week

**Step 5: Calculate Oliver's weekly earnings**
Oliver earns ¥0.45 per collection, so his weekly earnings are:
3000 collections/week * ¥0.45/collection = ¥1350/week

**Step 6: Calculate Oliver's weekly tips**
Oliver earns 14% on tips, so his weekly tips are:
14% of ¥1350 = 0.14 * ¥1350 = ¥189/week

**Step 7: Calculate Oliver's total weekly earnings**
Oliver's total weekly earnings = ¥1350/week (collections) + ¥189/week (tips) = ¥1539/week

First, we need to find out how many apartments are in the last complex. Since it's 50% bigger than the other 2 combined, we need to calculate the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes.
The first 2 complexes have 300 apartments each, so the total number of apartments is 2 * 300 = 600.
The last complex is 50% bigger than 600, which means it has 600 + (50% of 600) = 600 + 300 = 900 apartments.

Now, we know the total number of apartments in each complex:
Complex 1: 300 apartments
Complex 2: 300 apartments
Complex 3: 900 apartments

Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each place, so he collects garbage a total of 2 * 3 = 6 times a week.

He gets paid ¥0.45 per collection for each apartment. Let's calculate the total amount he earns from each complex:
Complex 1: 300 apartments * ¥0.45 * 2 collections = ¥270
Complex 2: 300 apartments * ¥0.45 * 2 collections = ¥270
Complex 3: 900 apartments * ¥0.45 * 2 collections = ¥810

The total amount he earns from all complexes is ¥270 + ¥270 + ¥810 = ¥1350.

He also earns 14% on tips, which means he earns an additional 14% of ¥1350. To calculate this, we multiply ¥1350 by 0.14:
¥1350 * 0.14 = ¥189

So, the total amount he earns in a week is ¥1350 + ¥189 = ¥1539.

The maintenance worker has 180 floors to clean. It takes them 6 minutes per floor, but since they are slower now, it will take them twice as long. So, the time per floor is 2 * 6 minutes = 12 minutes per floor.

Total time spent cleaning floors = 180 floors * 12 minutes/floor = 2160 minutes

Since they have 10 days to complete the task, we can calculate the average time spent cleaning floors per day:

216 minutes / 60 = 3.6 hours/day

The maintenance worker works for 6 hours a day. To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning floors, we can divide the time spent cleaning floors by the total time available and multiply by 100:

90 + 270 + 360 + 180 + 45 = 945 kernels popped in total.

**Step 7: Alejandro gives some to Tariq**
Alejandro gives 1/5 of the made popcorns to his brother Tariq, so:
945 x 1/5 = 189 kernels given to Tariq.

**Step 8: Alejandro's share**
Subtract the kernels given to Tariq from the total:
945 - 189 = 756 kernels left for Alejandro to eat.

Therefore, Alejandro has 756 pieces of popcorn to eat.",756.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

In the first 22 seconds, 90 kernels pop.
In the next 22 seconds, the kernels pop at 3 times the initial rate, so 3 * 90 = 270 kernels pop.
In the next 22 seconds, the kernels pop at 4 times the initial rate, so 4 * 90 = 360 kernels pop.
In the final 22 seconds, the kernels pop at half the rate of the past 22 seconds, so 360 / 2 = 180 kernels pop.
From the residual heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds also pop, so 180 / 4 = 45 kernels pop.
The total number of kernels that popped is 90 + 270 + 360 + 180 + 45 = 945.
Alejandro gives 1/5 of the made popcorns to his brother Tariq, so 945 * (1/5) = 189 kernels are given away.
The number of kernels left for Alejandro is 945 - 189 = 756.
The answer is 756.",756.0,1,,756.0,1

We know that there are 4 green cubes and five times as many black cubes, which means there are 5 x 4 = 20 black cubes.

We also know that the total number of cubes in the pyramid is 40.

Let's use a variable to represent the unknown number of white cubes. Let's call it x.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of cubes:

4 (green cubes) + 20 (black cubes) + x (white cubes) = 40

Combine the constants:

24 + x = 40

Subtract 24 from both sides:

x = 16

So, there are 16 white cubes.

To find the percentage of white cubes, divide the number of white cubes by the total number of cubes and multiply by 100:

(16 ÷ 40) x 100 = 40%

Therefore, 40% of the cubes in the pyramid are white.",40.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The pyramid is made out of 4 green cubes.
It also has five times as many black cubes, which is 4 * 5 = 20 black cubes.
The total number of green and black cubes is 4 + 20 = 24 cubes.
Since there are 40 cubes in total, the number of white cubes is 40 - 24 = 16 cubes.
To find the percentage of white cubes, we divide the number of white cubes by the total number of cubes and multiply by 100.
So, the percentage of white cubes is (16 / 40) * 100 = 40%.
The answer is 40%.",40.0,1,,40.0,1

If the force need to move the car is 2% of the total weight, how much force does Esteban need to push the car?",44.0,"To find the total weight of the car, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, the children, and the spare tires.

Weight of the car: 1350 pounds
Weight of the luggage: 450 pounds
Weight of the children: 4 x 65 pounds = 260 pounds
Weight of the spare tires: 2 x 70 pounds = 140 pounds

Total weight = 1350 + 450 + 260 + 140 = 2200 pounds

The force needed to move the car is 2% of the total weight. To find 2% of the total weight, we can multiply the total weight by 0.02.

Force needed = 0.02 x 2200 pounds = 44 pounds

So, Esteban needs to push the car with a force of 44 pounds.",44.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The car weighs 1350 pounds.
The luggage weighs 450 pounds.
The 4 children weigh 65 pounds each, so the total weight of the children is 4 * 65 = 260 pounds.
The two spare tires weigh 70 pounds each, so the total weight of the tires is 2 * 70 = 140 pounds.

To find the total weight, we need to add the weight of the car, luggage, children, and tires:
1350 + 450 + 260 + 140 = 2200 pounds.

The force needed to move the car is 2% of the total weight. To find 2% of 2200, we multiply 2200 by 0.02:

We know that Oscar is 54 years old.

Since Oscar is 27 years younger than Arash, we can find Arash's age by adding 27 to Oscar's age:

Arash's age = Oscar's age + 27
= 54 + 27
= 81

So, Arash is 81 years old.

We also know that Oscar is 18 years older than Ali. To find Ali's age, we can subtract 18 from Oscar's age:

Ali's age = Oscar's age - 18
= 54 - 18
= 36

So, Ali is 36 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all three people:

Oscar: 54
Arash: 81
Ali: 36

To find the average of their ages, we can add their ages and divide by 3:

Average age = (Oscar's age + Arash's age + Ali's age) / 3
= (54 + 81 + 36) / 3
= 171 / 3
