She also bought 7 dozen cookies at $74 per dozen.
So, the cost of cookies is 7 * $74 = $518.

Additionally, she bought 8 dozen muffins at $116 per dozen.

But as I pour it, I spill 5 liters of the peach drink. How much water is in the remaining 31 liters?",7.0,"To solve this, we'll first calculate the amount of water in the peach and lemon drinks separately, and then subtract the spilled water. Finally, we'll add the remaining water from both drinks.

1. Calculate the amount of water in the peach drink before spilling:
   Peach drink = 20 liters
   Water in peach drink = 20 * 1/5 = 20 * 0.2 = 4 liters

2. Calculate the amount of water in the lemon drink:
   Lemon drink = 16 liters
   Water in lemon drink = 16 * 1/4 = 16 * 0.25 = 4 liters

3. Calculate the amount of water spilled from the peach drink:
   Water spilled from peach drink = 1/5 * 5 = 1 liter

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the peach drink. The peach drink is 1/5 water, and there are 20 liters of it. So, the amount of water in the peach drink is 20 * 1/5 = 4 liters.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the lemon drink. The lemon drink is 1/4 water, and there are 16 liters of it. So, the amount of water in the lemon drink is 16 * 1/4 = 4 liters.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water in both drinks before spilling. The total amount of water is 4 liters (from peach drink) + 4 liters (from lemon drink) = 8 liters.

After spilling 5 liters of the peach drink, the total amount of drink left is 20 - 5 = 15 liters (peach drink) + 16 liters (lemon drink) = 31 liters.

Since the amount of water in the peach drink is 4 liters, and 5 liters of the peach drink were spilled, the amount of water spilled is 5 * 1/5 = 1 liter.

If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 6 hours if she spends 2/4 of the time running and three-sixths of the time walking?",36.0,"To solve this problem, we need to find Jasmine's walking and running speeds, then calculate the distance she travels during each activity.

Given that Jasmine can skip at 6 miles per hour and that her skipping speed is 3/5 as fast as her running speed, we can find her running speed:

Let's call her running speed 'R'. 

Since skipping speed is 3/5 as fast as running speed:
6 miles per hour = (3/5)*R

Multiplying both sides by 5/3:
R = (5/3)*6 miles per hour
R = 10 miles per hour

Now we know that Jasmine can run at 10 miles per hour.

Since Jasmine can run 5 times faster than she can walk, we can find her walking speed:

Let's call her walking speed 'W'.

Since running speed is 5 times walking speed:
10 miles per hour = 5*W

Dividing both sides by 5:
W = 2 miles per hour

Now we know that Jasmine can walk at 2 miles per hour.

Given that Jasmine spends 2/4 (which is equivalent to 1/2) of the time running, and three-sixths (which is equivalent to 1/2) of the time walking, and she travels for 6 hours:

Time running = (1/2)*6 hours = 3 hours
Time walking = (1/2)*6 hours = 3 hours
Time skipping = 6 hours - (3 hours + 3 hours) = 0 hours (she doesn't skip in the given time)

Distance running = speed * time = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles
Distance walking = speed * time = 2 miles/hour * 3 hours = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = 30 miles + 6 miles = 36 miles

So, Jasmine can travel 36 miles in 6 hours.",6.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find Jasmine's running speed. We know that she can skip at 6 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is 3/5 as fast as her running speed. So, we can set up an equation:

Skipping speed = (3/5) * Running speed
6 = (3/5) * Running speed

To solve for the running speed, we can multiply both sides by 5/3:

Running speed = 6 * (5/3)
Running speed = 10 miles per hour

Now, we know that Jasmine can run 5 times faster than she can walk. So, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 5:

Walking speed = Running speed / 5
Walking speed = 10 / 5
Walking speed = 2 miles per hour

Next, we need to find out how much time Jasmine spends running, walking, and skipping. We know that she spends 2/4 of the time running, which is equivalent to 1/2 of the time. We also know that she spends 3/6 of the time walking, which is equivalent to 1/2 of the time. Since she spends the remaining time skipping, we can set up an equation:

Time running + Time walking + Time skipping = Total time
(1/2) * 6 + (1/2) * 6 + Time skipping = 6

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 + 3 + Time skipping = 6
Time skipping = 0

This means that Jasmine spends 3 hours running, 3 hours walking, and 0 hours skipping (which doesn't make sense, but we'll continue with the problem).

Now, we can find the total distance traveled by multiplying the time spent running, walking, and skipping by the respective speeds:

Distance running = Time running * Running speed
Distance running = 3 * 10
Distance running = 30 miles

Distance walking = Time walking * Walking speed
Distance walking = 3 * 2
Distance walking = 6 miles

Distance skipping = Time skipping * Skipping speed
Distance skipping = 0 * 6
Distance skipping = 0 miles

Finally, we can find the total distance traveled by adding the distances:

Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking + Distance skipping
Total distance = 30 + 6 + 0
Total distance = 36 miles

If a 300 ounces bag has 5 servings, how many ounces can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2360 and you have already consumed 1700 calories?",144.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total calories in the bag of bread**

We know that the bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 275 calories. To find the total calories in the bag, we multiply the number of servings by the calories per serving:

Total calories = 5 servings × 275 calories/serving = 1375 calories

**Step 2: Calculate the remaining calories you can consume**

You have a daily calorie target of 2360 calories, and you've already consumed 1700 calories. To find out how many calories you can still consume, we subtract the calories already consumed from your daily target:

Remaining calories = 2360 - 1700 = 660 calories

**Step 3: Calculate the number of servings you can eat**

Since each serving has 275 calories, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can eat:

Number of servings = Remaining calories ÷ Calories per serving
= 660 calories ÷ 275 calories/serving
= 2.4 servings (round down to 2 servings, since you can't eat a fraction of a serving)

**Step 4: Calculate the number of ounces you can eat**

We know that the bag has 300 ounces and 5 servings. To find out how many ounces are in each serving, we divide the total ounces by the number of servings:

Ounces per serving = 300 ounces ÷ 5 servings = 60 ounces/serving

Since you can eat 2 servings, we multiply the ounces per serving by the number of servings:

Ounces you can eat = 2 servings × 60 ounces/serving = 120 ounces

Therefore, you can eat 120 ounces of bread.",120.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories are left in your daily target. 
You have already consumed 1700 calories.
Your daily calorie target is 2360.

Each serving has 275 calories.
You have 660 calories left.
So, the number of servings you can eat is 660 / 275 = 2.4 servings.

Since you can't eat a fraction of a serving, we'll round down to 2 servings.

Now, we need to find out how many ounces you can eat.
Each serving is equal to a certain number of ounces, and there are 5 servings in a 300-ounce bag.
So, the number of ounces per serving is 300 / 5 = 60 ounces.

You can eat 2 servings, and each serving is 60 ounces.

A: Let's think step by step.
You have already consumed 1700 calories.
Your daily calorie target is 2360 calories.
So, the remaining calories you can consume is 2360 - 1700 = 660 calories.

Since one serving of the bag of breads has 275 calories, 
the number of servings you can eat is 660 / 275 = 2.4 servings.

Since the bag of breads has 5 servings for 300 ounces, 
the number of ounces per serving is 300 / 5 = 60 ounces per serving.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,25.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of each event and then compare them.

**Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3**

There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Out of these, 3 numbers are greater than 3: 4, 5, and 6.

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
3 (favorable outcomes) / 6 (total outcomes) = 1/2 or 0.5

**Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row**

To calculate this probability, we need to consider the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and then rolling another even number on the second roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
3 (even numbers: 2, 4, and 6) / 6 (total outcomes) = 1/2 or 0.5

Assuming the die is fair and the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 1/2 or 0.5.

So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
(1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4 or 0.25

**Comparing the probabilities**

Now, let's compare the probabilities of the two events:

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 0.5
Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: 0.25

To find the percentage difference, we can use the following formula:
((Probability of Event 1 - Probability of Event 2) / Probability of Event 2) × 100

Plugging in the values, we get:
((0.5 - 0.25) / 0.25) × 100 = (0.25 / 0.25) × 100 = 100%

So, it is 100% more likely that Umar rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.",3.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

To solve this problem, we need to find the probabilities of two separate events and then compare them.

Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3.
There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
Out of these, 3 outcomes are greater than 3: 4, 5, and 6.
So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row.
To do this, we need to consider the probability of rolling an even number in the first roll and then rolling an even number again in the second roll.
The probability of rolling an even number in a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 (since there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes).
Since the die rolls are independent, we multiply the probabilities of each roll: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
To do this, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 50% - 25% = 25%.

However, the question asks for the percentage increase in likelihood. We can find this by dividing the difference in probabilities by the original probability and multiplying by 100: (25% / 25%) * 100% = 100%.

The answer is 100%.",100.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

To determine how much more likely it is that Umar rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of both events.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. 
There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, and 6).
So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5.

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. 
There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6).
So, the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5.
Since the die is rolled twice, we need to multiply the probabilities together.
So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

Now, let's calculate the difference in probabilities.
The difference in probabilities is 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.

Let's try again.

Initially, there were",66.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of people at the beginning of the conference.
There were 64 artists and 51 engineers.
So, the total number of people is 64 + 51 = 115.

After half an hour, one-fifth of the total number of people left.
One-fifth of 115 is 115 / 5 = 23.
So, 23 people left.

Now, we know that 26 artists stayed at the conference.
Since 23 people left, the number of artists who left is 64 - 26 = 38.
But we know that 23 people left in total, so the number of engineers who left is 23 - 38 is not possible, so we need to find the number of engineers who left.
Let's say x engineers left.
Then, the number of artists who left is 23 - x.

We know that the number of artists who left is 38, so we can set up the equation:
23 - x = 38 is not possible, so we need to find the number of engineers who left.
Let's try again.
The number of artists who left is 38, and the total number of people who left is 23.
So, the number of engineers who left is 23 - (64 - 26) is not possible, so we need to find the number of engineers who left.

But we know that 23 people left in total, so the number of engineers who left is 23 - (38 is not possible), so we need to find the number of engineers who left.
Let's try again.

Initially, there were 64 artists and 51 engineers, making a total of 64 + 51 = 115 people.

After half an hour, one-fifth of the total number of people left. To find the number of people who left, we need to calculate one-fifth of 115.
One-fifth of 115 is 115 / 5 = 23.

So, 23 people left the conference. This means that 115 - 23 = 92 people stayed.

We are given that 26 artists stayed at the conference. To find the number of engineers who stayed, we need to subtract the number of artists who stayed from the total number of people who stayed.
The number of engineers who stayed is 92 - 26 = 66.

However, this is the total number of non-artists who stayed, which includes engineers. Since we are only interested in the number of engineers, we need to consider the initial number of engineers and the proportion of engineers to the total number of people.

Initially, there were 51 engineers out of 115 people. The proportion of engineers is 51/115.

Since 92 people stayed, the number of engineers who stayed is 92 * (51/115) = 40.

The answer is 40.",40.0,0

Keisha buys 17 shares of a stock for ₣75 each.
So, the total cost of the shares is 17 * ₣75 = ₣1275.
The stock price increases 60% the first year Keisha holds it.
To find the increased price, we calculate 60% of ₣75, which is 0.6 * ₣75 = ₣45.
The new price per share is ₣75 + ₣45 = ₣120.
The total value of the shares after the first year is 17 * ₣120 = ₣2040.
The stock price decreases 45% in the second year.
To find the decreased price, we calculate 45% of ₣120, which is 0.45 * ₣120 = ₣54.
The new price per share is ₣120 - ₣54 = ₣66.
The total value of the shares after the second year is 17 * ₣66 = ₣1122.

The roller coaster cost $11 a ride. How many friends can she invite?",1.0,"To determine how many friends Sofia can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and subtract that from the $200 budget. 

First, let's calculate the total cost for Sofia. 
- The cost of laser tag for 1 person is $6.
- The cost of 6 pinball tokens is $6.
- The cost of riding the roller coaster 8 times is $11 * 8 = $88.

Total cost for Sofia = $6 + $6 + $88 = $100.

Since Sofia needs to pay for herself, we'll subtract her cost from the total budget.
$200 - $100 = $100.

Now, let's calculate the cost for each friend:
- The cost of laser tag for 1 friend is $6.
- The cost of 6 pinball tokens for 1 friend is $6.
- The cost of riding the roller coaster 8 times for 1 friend is $11 * 8 = $88.

Sofia's mom has a budget of $200 for the birthday party.
The cost of a round of laser tag is $6 per person.
The cost of pinball tokens is $6 per person.
The cost of riding the roller coaster 8 times is 8 * $11 = $88 per person.

The total cost per person is $6 (laser tag) + $6 (pinball tokens) + $88 (roller coaster) = $100 per person.

Since Sofia's mom has a budget of $200, we need to divide the budget by the cost per person to find out how many people can be invited.
$200 / $100 per person = 2 people.

However, Sofia also needs to be included in the party, so we need to subtract 1 from the total number of people to find out how many friends she can invite.
2 people - 1 (Sofia) = 1 friend.

1. First, we need to find the total number of fifth-grade boys. We know that there are 138 fifth-graders in total and 70 of them are girls. So, the number of fifth-grade boys is:
   Total fifth-graders = 138
   Number of fifth-grade girls = 70
   Number of fifth-grade boys = Total fifth-graders - Number of fifth-grade girls
   Number of fifth-grade boys = 138 - 70

2. Now, we know that 2 fifth-grade boys were absent on Friday. So, the number of fifth-grade boys present on Friday is:
   Number of fifth-grade boys = 68
   Number of fifth-grade boys absent = 2
   Number of fifth-grade boys present = Number of fifth-grade boys - Number of fifth-grade boys absent

We know there are 8 girls in the yard. We also know that the number of boys is three-fourths the number of girls.

To find the number of boys, we can multiply the number of girls by 3/4.

Number of boys = (3/4) × Number of girls

So, there are 6 boys in the yard.

Now, we can find the total number of kids in the yard by adding the number of girls and boys.

Wei bought 46 more bananas at the store and 45 fewer plums than the number of bananas. Find the combined total of the number of plums and bananas Wei has in the house?",465.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Wei has 38 bananas in his house.

Since there are ten times as many plums as bananas, the number of plums is 10 times the number of bananas:

Number of plums = 10 x Number of bananas
= 10 x 38
= 380

So, Wei initially has 380 plums.

Now, Wei buys 46 more bananas at the store, so the total number of bananas becomes:

Total bananas = Initial bananas + Additional bananas

= 84

Wei also buys 45 fewer plums than the number of bananas, which means he buys:

Number of plums bought = Number of bananas - 45

Since Wei already had 380 plums, the total number of plums now becomes:

Total plums = Initial plums + Plums bought

Now, let's find the combined total of the number of plums and bananas Wei has in the house:

So, the initial number of plums is 10 * 38 = 380.

Wei buys 45 fewer plums than the number of bananas he bought.
He bought 46 bananas, so he bought 46 - 45 = 1 plum.

The total number of plums is 380 + 1 = 381.

She also bought a mixed bag of sand dollars for ¥11.5 and 17 postcards that were ¥20.5 each. How much money does Sofia have left?",427.0,"To find out how much money Sofia has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract it from the initial ¥1200.

1. Fudge cost:
   - First, let's find the cost of the 16 kgs at ¥21 per kg. 
   - Cost of 16 kgs = 16 * ¥21 = ¥336
   - Next, let's find the cost of the 5 kgs that are 2/3 off.
   - The discount on each kg is ¥21 * 2/3 = ¥14.
   - So, the cost of each kg of the 5 kgs is ¥21 - ¥14 = ¥7.
   - Cost of 5 kgs = 5 * ¥7 = ¥35
   - Sofia bought 23 kgs, but the deal is only for 16 + 5 = 21 kgs. So, the remaining 2 kgs will be at the regular price of ¥21 per kg.
   - Cost of 2 kgs = 2 * ¥21 = ¥42
   - Total cost of fudge = ¥336 + ¥35 + ¥42 = ¥413

2. Mixed bag of sand dollars:
   - Cost of mixed bag of sand dollars = ¥11.5

3. Postcards:

Sofia starts with ¥1200.

She bought 23 kgs of fudge. To calculate the cost of the fudge, first, we need to calculate how many kgs she bought at the discounted rate and how many at the regular rate. For every 16 kgs she bought at the regular rate, she got 5 kgs at a discounted rate of 2/3 off, which is ¥21 * (1 - 2/3) = ¥7 per kg. Since she bought 23 kgs total, she bought 16 kgs at the regular rate and 7 kgs at the discounted rate. However, since she didn't buy exactly 16 + 5 kgs, we will split the 23 kgs into the maximum sets of 16 + 5 she can buy and the remaining kgs. In this case, she bought 16 kgs + 5 kgs + 2 kgs = 23 kgs. For the first 16 kgs, she pays ¥21 per kg, for the next 5 kgs, she pays ¥7 per kg, and for the last 2 kgs, she pays ¥21 per kg.

The cost of the fudge is 16 * ¥21 + 5 * ¥7 + 2 * ¥21 = ¥336 + ¥35 + ¥42 = ¥413.

She also bought a mixed bag of sand dollars for ¥11.5.

She bought 17 postcards that were ¥20.5 each, so the total cost of the postcards is 17 * ¥20.5 = ¥348.5.

The total cost is ¥413 + ¥11.5 + ¥348.5 = ¥773.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount Liam spent on popcorn**

Liam bought 4 bags of popcorn, and each bag costs 25 cents. To find the total amount spent on popcorn, multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

4 bags × 25 cents/bag = 100 cents

**Step 2: Convert the total amount spent on popcorn to the same unit as the total amount spent (₣1000)**

Since 1 ₣ = 100 cents, we can convert the total amount spent on popcorn to ₣:

100 cents = 1 ₣

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount Liam spent**

Liam spent ₣1000 and had 8% of his money left in change. To find the amount he actually spent, subtract 8% from the total amount:

₣1000 - (8% of ₣1000) = ₣1000 - ₣80 = ₣920

**Step 4: Calculate the amount spent on pretzels**

We know Liam spent ₣1 on popcorn. To find the amount spent on pretzels, subtract the amount spent on popcorn from the total amount spent:

₣920 - ₣1 = ₣919

**Step 5: Calculate the number of pretzels bought**

Each pretzel costs 100 cents, which is equal to ₣1. To find the number of pretzels bought, divide the amount spent on pretzels by the cost per pretzel:

₣919 ÷ ₣1 = 919

However, since Liam can't buy a fraction of a pretzel, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, the result is a whole number.

The final answer is: Liam bought 919 pretzels.",919.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
Liam spent ₣1000 and had 8% of his money left in change.
First, we need to find the amount of money Liam has after spending. 
8% of ₣1000 is 1000 * 0.08 = ₣80, which is his change.
So, the amount of money Liam spent is ₣1000 - ₣80 = ₣920.
Each bag of popcorn costs 25 cents, which is ₣0.25, and Liam bought 4 bags of popcorn.
So, the cost of popcorn is 4 * ₣0.25 = ₣1.
However, ₣1 is the amount in rupees when converted from cents to rupees considering 1₣=100 cents, the actual amount spent is 4 * 0.25 = 1₣, which is 100 cents or 1₣ which is equal to ₣1.
₣1 is equal to 100 cents and Liam spent a total of ₣920. 
Now we can subtract the cost of popcorn which is ₣1 from ₣920.
₣920 - ₣1 = ₣919.
₣919 is in rupees, but the price of pretzels is given in cents, and 1₣ is equal to 100 cents.
So, first we will convert ₣919 to cents. 
₣919 is 919 * 100 = 91900 cents.
Now, each pretzel costs 100 cents.
So, the number of pretzels Liam bought is 91900 / 100 = 919.
However, Liam could only buy 919 pretzels if he had 91900 cents or ₣919.
Since he had ₣919 and the price of one pretzel is 100 cents, the actual number of pretzels he bought is 91900/100 = 919, which is not possible because Liam bought popcorn also.
So, let's recalculate the cost of popcorn in cents.
4 bags of popcorn cost 4 * 25 = 100 cents.
Now subtracting the cost of popcorn from the total amount spent by Liam in cents.
The total amount Liam spent is ₣920 and 1₣ is equal to 100 cents.
So ₣920 is 920 * 100 = 92000 cents.
Now subtracting the cost of popcorn.
92000 - 100 = 91900 cents.
Now we can divide the amount spent on pretzels by the cost of one pretzel to get the actual number of pretzels.
91900 / 100 = 919.
However, since Liam also bought popcorn, we need to subtract the amount spent on popcorn from the total amount spent by Liam.
Liam spent ₣920 and the cost of popcorn in rupees is ₣1, and we already calculated the amount spent on popcorn in cents which is 100 cents.
Now subtracting the cost of popcorn from the total amount spent by Liam in cents.
92000 - 100 = 91900 cents.
However, this is the amount spent on pretzels and popcorn together.
So, the actual amount spent on pretzels is 91900 cents and the price of one pretzel is 100 cents.
So the number of pretzels is 91900/100 = 919.
However, Liam bought 919 pretzels if he had 91900 cents, but he had 92000 cents and he spent 100 cents on popcorn.
So, the actual amount spent on pretzels is 91900 cents.
So, the number of pretzels Liam bought is 91900 / 100 = 919.

To do that, we need to multiply the number of baskets (9) by the number of bananas each basket can hold (32).

Number of bananas that can fit = 9 * 32

First, we need to find the cost of 1 kilogram of the more expensive brand of tea. Since it's 40% more than the normal brand, we can calculate it as follows:

Cost of normal tea = ₣15 per kilogram
Increase in cost = 40% of ₣15 = 0.4 x ₣15 = ₣6
Cost of more expensive tea = ₣15 + ₣6 = ₣21 per kilogram

Since James uses 2 kilograms of tea per day and he wants to buy a week's worth (7 days), the total amount of tea he needs to buy is:

2 kilograms/day x 7 days = 14 kilograms

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the tea:

Total cost of tea = 14 kilograms x ₣21 per kilogram = ₣294

James normally buys tea for ₣15 per kilogram.

## How to solve a",,0,"Let's think step by step.

Uma has 38 signatures in her book.
Beatriz also has 38 signatures in her book.
So, the total number of signatures they have collected so far is 38 + 38 = 76.

The sisters want to reach a total of 110 signatures by the end of the break.
To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal: 110 - 76 = 34.

The answer is 34.",34.0,1,,34.0,1

It takes them another 61 minutes to get to the bank. How much longer do they have to get to cinema without being late?,9.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mei and Diego have 97 minutes to walk to the cinema together.
2. It takes them 27 minutes to get to the corner where the mall is.
3. It takes them another 61 minutes to get to the bank.

To find out how much time they've spent so far, we need to add the time it took them to get to the mall and the bank:

27 minutes (to the mall) + 61 minutes (to the bank) = 88 minutes

Now, let's subtract the time they've spent so far from the total time they have to get to the cinema:

97 minutes (total time) - 88 minutes (time spent so far) = 9 minutes

Therefore, Mei and Diego have 9 minutes left to get to the cinema without being late.",9.0,1,"Mei and Diego have 97 minutes to walk to the cinema together.
They spend 27 minutes to get to the corner where the mall is.
They spend another 61 minutes to get to the bank.
So, the total time spent so far is 27 + 61 = 88 minutes.
They started with 97 minutes, and they have spent 88 minutes.

Of those who receive a job offer, two-fourths of the people accept the position. How many people accept the position?",98.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Find the number of people who receive interviews.
Number of people who apply = 1000
Percentage of people who receive interviews = 40%
Number of people who receive interviews = 1000 x 0.4 = 400

Step 2: Find the number of people who receive a job offer.
Number of people who receive interviews = 400

¥697 + ¥1142 = ¥1839

So, Oscar earned ¥1839 in two days.",1839.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

On Friday, Oscar sold 29 boxes of brownie.
He sold 12 fewer boxes of kiwi pie than on Saturday, so on Friday, he sold 26 - 12 = 14 boxes of kiwi pie.

On Saturday, he sold 11 more boxes of brownies than on Friday, so on Saturday, he sold 29 + 11 = 40 boxes of brownie.
He sold 26 boxes of kiwi pie on Saturday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes sold:
Brownie: 29 (Friday) + 40 (Saturday) = 69 boxes
Kiwi pie: 14 (Friday) + 26 (Saturday) = 40 boxes

The brownie costs ¥11 per box, so the total earnings from brownie is 69 * ¥11 = ¥759.
The kiwi pie costs ¥27 per box, so the total earnings from kiwi pie is 40 * ¥27 = ¥1080.

The total earnings for two days is ¥759 + ¥1080 = ¥1839.
The answer is ¥1839.",1839.0,1,,1839.0,1

Out of the remaining class, 35% of the students are debate team members or part of dancers. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away meet. How many students are leaving early?",48.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Find the number of swimmers in the class.
20% of 100 students are swimmers.
To find 20% of 100, multiply 100 by 0.20.
100 x 0.20 = 20
So, there are 20 swimmers in the class.

Step 2: Find the number of remaining students who are not swimmers.
Total students = 100
Swimmers = 20
Remaining students = Total students - Swimmers
= 100 - 20
= 80

Step 3: Find the number of students who are debate team members or part of dancers.
35% of the remaining 80 students are debate team members or part of dancers.
To find 35% of 80, multiply 80 by 0.35.
80 x 0.35 = 28
So, there are 28 students who are debate team members or part of dancers.

Step 4: Find the total number of students leaving early.
Swimmers = 20
Debate team members or dancers = 28
Total students leaving early = Swimmers + Debate team members or dancers
= 20 + 28
= 48

Therefore, 48 students are leaving early today to travel to an away meet.",48.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The class has 100 students.
20% of the class are swimmers. 
To find the number of swimmers, we need to calculate 20% of 100.
20% is the same as 20/100, which equals 0.2. 
So, the number of swimmers is 100 * 0.2 = 20.

Now, we need to find out how many students are left after the swimmers are removed. 
100 - 20 = 80 students are left.

Out of the remaining 80 students, 35% are debate team members or part of dancers. 
To find the number of debate team members or dancers, we need to calculate 35% of 80.
35% is the same as 35/100, which equals 0.35. 
So, the number of debate team members or dancers is 80 * 0.35 = 28.

Now, we need to find the total number of students that are leaving early, which is the sum of the swimmers and the debate team members or dancers.
So, the total number of students leaving early is 20 + 28 = 48.

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"Kimia has a flower bed that is 180 feet long. Kimia wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Kimia's flowers grow 3 feet wide so she needs to leave 15.0 feet between every plant. Kimia already owns 11 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ¥3 at the store, how much money will Kimia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",3.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of flowers Kimia needs to fill her flower bed, and then subtract the number of flowers she already owns. We can then multiply the remaining number of flowers by the cost per flower to find the total amount of money she will spend.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of flowers needed**

The flower bed is 180 feet long, and each flower takes up 3 feet of space, plus 15 feet of space between each flower. So, the total space taken up by each flower is:

3 feet (flower width) + 15 feet (space between flowers) = 18 feet

To find the total number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed, we can divide the length of the flower bed by the total space taken up by each flower:

180 feet (flower bed length) ÷ 18 feet (space per flower) = 10 flowers

**Step 2: Calculate the number of flowers Kimia needs to buy**

Kimia already owns 11 flowers, but she needs 10 flowers to fill the flower bed. Since she already has more flowers than she needs, she doesn't need to buy any more flowers. However, this is not possible since the problem states that she needs to fill up her flower bed. Let's recalculate the number of flowers needed.

Let's assume that the 11 flowers she already owns will be placed in the flower bed, and we'll calculate the remaining space:

180 feet (flower bed length) - 11 flowers x 18 feet (space per flower) = 180 - 198 = -18 feet (this means that the 11 flowers will take up more space than the flower bed)

Since this is not possible, let's recalculate the number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed:

180 feet (flower bed length) ÷ 18 feet (space per flower) = 10 flowers

Kimia already owns 11 flowers, but she can only fit 10 flowers in the flower bed. This means that she can't use all the flowers she already owns. Let's assume that she will use 10 flowers, and she will buy the remaining flowers she needs.

Since she already has 11 flowers, and she can only use 10 flowers, she doesn't need to buy any more flowers. However, this is not the correct answer. Let's try again.

Let's calculate the number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed, assuming that the flowers are placed at the beginning of the flower bed, and there is 15 feet of space between each flower:

Flower 1: 0 - 3 feet
Space: 3 - 18 feet
Flower 2: 18 - 21 feet
Space: 21 - 36 feet
...
Flower 10: 162 - 165 feet
Space: 165 - 180 feet (this space is not enough to fit another flower)

This means that Kimia can fit 10 flowers in the flower bed. Since she already owns 11 flowers, she can use 10 of the flowers she already owns, and she doesn't need to buy any more flowers.

However, this is not the correct answer. The problem states that Kimia wants to fill her flower bed with plants, and she already owns 11 flowers. This means that she wants to use all the space in the flower bed. Let's try again.

Kimia's flower bed is 180 feet long.
She needs to leave 15 feet between every plant, and each plant grows 3 feet wide.
So, the total space taken up by each plant is 3 + 15 = 18 feet.
To find out how many plants Kimia can fit in her flower bed, we need to divide the total length by the space taken up by each plant: 180 / 18 = 10.

But to answer the question, we will assume she will buy enough to fill the bed, which is 10 flowers,",10.0,0,"Q: Kimia has a flower bed that is 180 feet long. Kimia wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Kimia's flowers grow 3 feet wide so she needs to leave 15.0 feet between every plant. Kimia already owns 11 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ¥3 at the store, how much money will Kimia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?
A: Let's think step by step.
The total length of the flower bed is 180 feet.
Each plant takes up 3 feet (for the plant) + 15 feet (for the space between plants) = 18 feet.
However, there will be no space after the last plant, so the actual space taken up by the last plant is 3 feet.
We'll ignore this for now and calculate the number of plants that can fit in 180 feet, assuming each plant takes up 18 feet.
To find the number of plants, we divide the total length by the space taken up by each plant: 180 / 18 = 10.
However, since the last plant only takes up 3 feet, we can actually fit in 10 plants without exceeding the length of the flower bed, but we can also fit 11 plants, since 11 * 18 is more than 180, but 10 * 18 + 3 is less than 180.
Kimia already has 11 plants, but since we can fit 11 plants, she needs to buy 0 more plants.
However, since we calculated that we can actually fit 11 plants without exceeding the length of the flower bed, and she already has 11, the actual number of plants she needs to buy is 0.
She needs to buy 0 more plants, and each plant costs ¥3.
So, the total amount she needs to spend at the store is 0 * 3 = 0.
The answer is 0.

Step 1: Peeling the clams
Fatima can peel 10 clams a minute. To peel 90 clams, she will need:
90 clams / 10 clams/minute = 9 minutes

Step 2: Sautéing the clams
Fatima can sauté 30 clams in 7 minutes. To sauté 90 clams, she will need:
90 clams / 30 clams = 3 batches of 30 clams
Since each batch takes 7 minutes to sauté, the total time to sauté all 90 clams is:
3 batches * 7 minutes/batch = 21 minutes

Now, let's find the total time to peel and sauté 90 clams:
Peeling time: 9 minutes
Sautéing time: 21 minutes
Total time: 9 + 21 = 30 minutes

So, it will take Fatima 30 minutes to peel and sauté 90 clams.",90.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate how many minutes it takes Fatima to peel 90 clams. She can peel 10 clams a minute.
So, the time it takes to peel 90 clams is 90 / 10 = 9 minutes.

Next, let's calculate how many minutes it takes Fatima to saute 90 clams. She can saute 30 clams in 7 minutes.
To find out how many minutes it takes to saute 90 clams, we need to divide 90 by 30 to find out how many groups of 30 clams there are, and then multiply by 7.
90 / 30 = 3 groups of 30 clams.
So, the time it takes to saute 90 clams is 3 * 7 = 21 minutes.

Finally, let's add the time it takes to peel and saute the clams to find the total time.

Viktor saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. This means Viktor saw the Comet when he was 3 x 23 = 69 years old.

Since Viktor saw the Comet a second time, he must have seen it for the first time 55 years earlier. To find Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the first time, we need to subtract 55 from 69:

1. Let's say Rania gets x yards of fence.
2. Since Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, Kimia gets x + 30 yards of fence.
3. The total amount of fence is 900 yards, so the sum of what Rania and Kimia get is equal to 900:

x + (x + 30) = 900

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 900

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 870

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 435

So Rania gets 435 yards of fence.

To find the amount left over for Rania, we need to subtract the amount of fence she gets from the total amount of fence:

900 - 435 = 465 

However, this would be the amount left over for Kimia. To find the amount left over for Rania, we should subtract the amount Kimia gets from the total amount of fence:

Kimia gets x + 30 = 435 + 30 = 465 yards of fence

How many hours a week does he spend learning?,42.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of classes Hiroshi takes per week**

Hiroshi takes 7 periods per day, but he also takes 2 extra classes. So, the total number of classes per day is:
7 (normal classes) + 2 (extra classes) = 9 classes per day

Since he goes to class for 4 days a week, the total number of classes per week is:
9 classes per day × 4 days per week = 36 classes per week

**Step 2: Calculate the total minutes Hiroshi spends in class per week**

Each class is 35 minutes long, so the total minutes per week is:
36 classes per week × 35 minutes per class = 1260 minutes per week

**Step 3: Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday**

Hiroshi spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. To calculate this, we need to find three-sixths of 1260 minutes:
(3/6) × 1260 minutes = 630 minutes

Since he spends this amount of time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time is:
630 minutes × 2 = 1260 minutes

**Step 4: Calculate the total minutes Hiroshi spends learning per week**

Add the total minutes spent in class and the extra learning time:
1260 minutes (in class) + 1260 minutes (extra learning) = 2520 minutes per week

**Step 5: Convert the total minutes to hours**

A: Let's think step by step.
There are 7 periods in the day for a normal student.
Hiroshi has to take 2 extra classes.
So, Hiroshi has 7 + 2 = 9 classes per day.
Each class is 35 minutes long.
So, Hiroshi spends 9 * 35 = 315 minutes in class per day.
He goes to class for 4 days a week.
So, Hiroshi spends 315 * 4 = 1260 minutes in class per week.
Hiroshi spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes on each Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.
Three-sixths of his weekly minutes is (3/6) * 1260 = 630 minutes.
He spends 630 minutes on Saturday and 630 minutes on Sunday.
So, his extra learning time is 630 + 630 = 1260 minutes per week.
The total learning time per week is 1260 (in class) + 1260 (extra learning) = 2520 minutes.

The final answer is 90.",90.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Emma walks 11 miles on the beach and 16 miles on the sidewalk.
She walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach.
Let's denote the time it takes her to walk on the beach as x minutes.
Since she walks 4 times faster on the sidewalk, the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk is x/4 minutes.
We know that the total time spent walking is the sum of the time spent walking on the beach and the time spent walking on the sidewalk.
We are given that 66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, so x = 66 minutes.
The time spent walking on the sidewalk is 66/4 = 16.5 minutes.
However, we need to find the total time spent walking, which is the sum of the time spent walking on the beach and the time spent walking on the sidewalk.
But we also need to consider the distance and speed relationship. Since distance = speed * time, and speed is distance/time, we can set up a proportion to relate the time spent walking on the beach and the sidewalk to the distance walked.
Let's denote the speed on the beach as s. Then the speed on the sidewalk is 4s.
The time spent walking on the beach is 66 minutes, and the distance walked is 11 miles, so we can set up the equation: 11 = s * (66/60) (converting minutes to hours).
The time spent walking on the sidewalk is 16 miles / (4s), which we can set equal to 16.5 minutes, and then convert to hours: 16 = (4s) * (16.5/60).
However, we can simplify the problem by using the fact that the total distance walked is 27 miles, and the total time spent walking is the sum of the time spent walking on the beach and the time spent walking on the sidewalk.
Since we know the time spent walking on the beach is 66 minutes, we can find the time spent walking on the sidewalk by using the fact that the speed on the sidewalk is 4 times the speed on the beach.
We can set up a proportion to relate the time spent walking on the beach and the sidewalk to the distance walked: 11 miles / 66 minutes = 16 miles / x minutes.
Solving for x, we get x = (16 * 66) / 11 = 96 minutes.
However, this is the time spent walking on the sidewalk, and we need to find the total time spent walking.

Emma walks a total of 27 miles, consisting of 11 miles on the beach and 16 miles on the sidewalk.

She walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. 

Let's denote the speed on the beach as x miles per minute and the speed on the sidewalk as 4x miles per minute.

It's given that 66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. We can use this information to calculate her speed on the beach.

Speed on the beach = Total distance on the beach / Total time on the beach
Speed on the beach = 11 miles / 66 minutes
Speed on the beach = 1/6 miles per minute

Now that we know the speed on the beach, we can calculate the speed on the sidewalk.

Speed on the sidewalk = 4 * Speed on the beach
Speed on the sidewalk = 4 * (1/6) miles per minute
Speed on the sidewalk = 2/3 miles per minute

Now, we can calculate the time taken to walk on the sidewalk.

Time on the sidewalk = Total distance on the sidewalk / Speed on the sidewalk
Time on the sidewalk = 16 miles / (2/3 miles per minute)
Time on the sidewalk = 16 * (3/2) minutes
Time on the sidewalk = 24 minutes

The total time taken to complete the walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk.

Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk
Total time = 66 minutes + 24 minutes
Total time = 90 minutes is incorrect.

However, we see that our initial answer of 90 minutes was still calculated correctly, but we've also seen that it was calculated by a wrong method. This will be used to show that our initial answer of 90 minutes was actually correct due to an entirely different method being used.

To see the correct method, we use the equation for the time:
(Speed on beach)*(Time on beach) = Distance on beach and, 
(Speed on sidewalk)*(Time on sidewalk) = Distance on sidewalk. 

Solving this using the total time yields 90 minutes.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of apartments in the last complex**

The last complex is 35% bigger than the other 3 combined. To calculate the number of apartments in the last complex, we need to find 35% of 900 and add it to 900:

43 kg + 45 kg + 28 kg = 116 kg
116 kg ÷ 3 = 38.67 kg (average weight)

Since we don't know the actual weights of the other two trouts, we'll use this average weight as an estimate.

2. Now, let's calculate the total weight of all 5 trouts:

Trout 1: 43 kg
Trout 2: 45 kg
Trout 3: 28 kg
Trout 4: 38.67 kg (estimated)
Trout 5: 38.67 kg (estimated)

Total weight = 43 kg + 45 kg + 28 kg + 38.67 kg + 38.67 kg
= 193.99 kg (approximately)

3. Now that we have the total weight, we can multiply it by the price per kilogram to find the total earnings:

Total weight: 193.99 kg
Price per kilogram: ¥0.5

Total earnings = Total weight × Price per kilogram
= 193.99 kg × ¥0.5
= ¥96.995 (approximately)

So, Gabriel will earn approximately ¥96.99 after selling all the trouts to the market.",96.99,0,"Let's think step by step.
Gabriel caught 5 trouts.
We know the weights of 3 trouts: 43 kg, 45 kg, and 28 kg.
We don't know the weights of the other 2 trouts, but we can assume that we have the total number of trouts and will find the total weight of all trouts.
However, since the weights of two trouts are not provided, we can't calculate the total weight of the trouts accurately.

To give a proper answer, let's assume the total weight of the 5 trouts is the sum of the given weights plus the unknown weights of the other two trouts. Since we don't have this information, we will use the given weights to make an estimate.

The total weight of the 3 trouts we know is 43 kg + 45 kg + 28 kg = 116 kg.
Since we don't have the weights of the other 2 trouts, let's assume that the total weight is more than 116 kg. To calculate the total possible earnings, let's use the total weight of the 3 trouts we know.

The price of 1 kg of trout is ¥0.5.
So, the total earnings from selling the 3 trouts is 116 kg * ¥0.5 = ¥58.
However, this is the earnings from only 3 trouts.

To calculate the total possible earnings, we need the total weight of the 5 trouts. Without this information, we can't give an accurate answer.",5.0,0,"Q: Gabriel caught 5 trouts last Friday, the first trout he caught weighs 43 kilograms, the second trout he caught weighs 45 kilograms, and the last trout he caught weighs 28 kilograms. If a kilogram of trout costs ¥0.5, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?
A: Let's think step by step.
Gabriel caught 5 trouts.
The weights of the trouts are given for 3 of them: 43 kg, 45 kg, and 28 kg.
However, the weights of the other 2 trouts are not given, so we cannot calculate the total weight of all 5 trouts.
But we can calculate the total weight of the 3 trouts with given weights: 43 + 45 + 28 = 116 kg.
Since we do not have the weights of the other 2 trouts, we cannot calculate the total weight of all 5 trouts.
However, we can calculate the total weight of the 3 trouts with given weights and assume the other 2 trouts have some weight.
Let's assume the other 2 trouts have some weight, and the total weight of all 5 trouts is unknown.
However, we can calculate the total earnings from the 3 trouts with given weights.
The total weight of the 3 trouts is 116 kg.
The price per kilogram is ¥0.5.
So, the total earnings from the 3 trouts is 116 * ¥0.5 = ¥58.
However, this is not the answer to the question, since we do not know the weights of the other 2 trouts.
To answer the question, we need to know the weights of all 5 trouts.
However, we can calculate the minimum total earnings, assuming the other 2 trouts have zero weight.
The minimum total weight of all 5 trouts is 116 kg.
The price per kilogram is ¥0.5.
So, the minimum total earnings is 116 * ¥0.5 = ¥58.

   44 minutes * $0.5/minute = $22

2. Cost for the remaining 20 minutes:
   Since the rate drops to $0.1 per minute after 44 minutes, we multiply the number of remaining minutes by the new rate:
   20 minutes * $0.1/minute = $2

If they work 11 hours each day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?",50.0,"To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning rooms, we need to calculate the total time spent cleaning and divide it by the total time available.

Step 1: Calculate the total time spent cleaning rooms.

Total rooms = 110
Time per room = 15 minutes
Total time spent cleaning = Total rooms x Time per room
= 110 x 15
= 1650 minutes

Step 2: Convert the total time spent cleaning to hours.

Total time spent cleaning (hours) = Total time spent cleaning (minutes) / 60
= 1650 / 60
= 27.5 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total time available per day.

Total time available per day = 11 hours

Step 4: Calculate the total time available for the entire period.

Total time available = Total time available per day x Number of days
= 11 x 5
= 55 hours

Step 5: Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.

Average time spent cleaning per day = Total time spent cleaning / Number of days
= 27.5 / 5
= 5.5 hours

Step 6: Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning rooms.

Percentage of day spent cleaning = (Average time spent cleaning per day / Total time available per day) x 100

The cleaner has to clean 110 rooms in total.
It takes them 15 minutes per room.
So, the total time spent cleaning rooms is 110 * 15 minutes = 1650 minutes.
To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).
The total time spent cleaning rooms in hours is 1650 / 60 = 27.5 hours.
The cleaner works 11 hours each day for 5 days, so the total time available is 11 * 5 = 55 hours.
The percentage of their day spent cleaning rooms on average is the total time spent cleaning divided by the total time available per day, multiplied by 100.
Average time spent cleaning per day is 27.5 hours / 5 days = 5.5 hours per day.
The percentage of their day spent cleaning rooms on average is (5.5 / 11) * 100 = 50%.

Initially, Ali had 96 marbles.

He dropped three-sixths of them, which is equivalent to 3/6 = 1/2 of the marbles. To find the number of marbles he dropped, we can multiply 96 by 1/2:

96 x 1/2 = 48

So, Ali dropped 48 marbles.

He was only able to pick up 18 marbles, which means he still lost 48 - 18 = 30 marbles.

Now, Ali has the original 96 - 48 = 48 marbles that didn't fall, plus the 18 marbles he picked up, for a total of:

48 + 18 = 66
