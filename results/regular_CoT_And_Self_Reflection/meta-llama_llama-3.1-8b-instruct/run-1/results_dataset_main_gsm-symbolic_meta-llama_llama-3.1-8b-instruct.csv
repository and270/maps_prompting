Sofia bought 6 dozen eclairs.
The cost of each dozen eclairs is $18.
So, the total cost of eclairs is 6 * $18 = $108.

She bought 7 dozen cookies.
The cost of each dozen cookies is $74.
So, the total cost of cookies is 7 * $74 = $518.

She bought 8 dozen muffins.
The cost of each dozen muffins is $116.
So, the total cost of muffins is 8 * $116 = $928.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of eclairs, cookies, and muffins.
So, the total cost is $108 + $518 + $928 = $1554.

Peach drink:
- Total volume: 20 liters
- Water content: 1/5 of 20 liters

Lemon drink:
- Total volume: 16 liters
- Water content: 1/4 of 16 liters
- Water content in lemon drink = (1/4) * 16 = 4 liters

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water in each drink after pouring some of the peach drink:
- Volume of peach drink remaining = 20 - 5 = 15 liters
- Water content in remaining peach drink = 4 liters

Total volume of the mixture = 15 liters (remaining peach drink) + 16 liters (lemon drink) = 31 liters

Total water in the mixture = Water in remaining peach drink + Water in lemon drink
= 4 liters + 4 liters
= 8 liters

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 31 liters is 8 liters.",8.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's find out how much water is in the original 20 liters of peach drink.
The peach drink is 1/5 water, so the amount of water in 20 liters is 20 * (1/5) = 4 liters.

Next, let's find out how much water is in the original 16 liters of lemon drink.
The lemon drink is 1/4 water, so the amount of water in 16 liters is 16 * (1/4) = 4 liters.

Now, let's add the remaining 15 liters of peach drink (after spilling 5 liters) to the 16 liters of lemon drink.
The total amount of liquid is 15 + 16 = 31 liters.

The amount of water in the peach drink is 4 liters, and the amount of water in the lemon drink is 4 liters.
So, the total amount of water in the remaining 31 liters is 4 + 4 = 8 liters.

However, we also need to consider the water that was spilled from the peach drink. Since the peach drink is 1/5 water, the amount of water spilled is 5 * (1/5) = 1 liter.

So, the total amount of water in the remaining 31 liters is 8 + 1 = 9 liters.

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the peach drink:
The peach drink is 1/5 water, so the amount of water in 20 liters of peach drink is 20 * (1/5) = 4 liters.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the lemon drink:
The lemon drink is 1/4 water, so the amount of water in 16 liters of lemon drink is 16 * (1/4) = 4 liters.

Now, let's consider the peach drink that was spilled:
We spilled 5 liters of peach drink, which contains 5 * (1/5) = 1 liter of water.

So, the total amount of water in the remaining 31 liters is the sum of the water in the peach drink and the lemon drink, minus the water that was spilled:
Water in peach drink = 4 liters
Water in lemon drink = 4 liters
Water spilled = 1 liter
Total water in remaining 31 liters = (4 + 4) - 1 = 7 liters.

However, we need to consider that the peach drink that was spilled was 1/5 water, but the remaining peach drink is 20 - 5 = 15 liters, which is 1/5 water. So, the amount of water in the remaining peach drink is 15 * (1/5) = 3 liters.

Now, let's recalculate the total amount of water in the remaining 31 liters:
Water in peach drink = 3 liters
Water in lemon drink = 4 liters

If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 6 hours if she spends 2/4 of the time running and three-sixths of the time walking?",36.0,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Given information:
- Jasmine runs 5 times faster than she walks
- She can skip at a rate of 3/5 as fast as she runs
- She can skip at 6 miles per hour

First, let's find out how fast Jasmine can run:
If she can skip at 6 miles per hour and her skipping speed is 3/5 of her running speed, we can set up the equation:
6 = (3/5) * R
where R is her running speed.

To find R, we multiply both sides by 5/3:
R = 6 * (5/3)
R = 10 miles per hour

Now we know she can run at 10 miles per hour.

Since Jasmine runs 5 times faster than she walks, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 5:
Walking speed = 10 / 5
Walking speed = 2 miles per hour

Now we need to find the time she spends walking and running in 6 hours. 
- She spends 2/4 of the time running, which is equal to 1/2 of the time or 3 hours.
- She spends 3/6 of the time walking, which is equal to 1/2 of the time or 3 hours.

So, she walks for 3 hours and runs for 3 hours.

Now we can calculate the total distance she travels in 6 hours:
- While walking, she travels 2 miles per hour for 3 hours. 
- While running, she travels 10 miles per hour for 3 hours.

Walking distance = 2 * 3 = 6 miles
Running distance = 10 * 3 = 30 miles

Total distance = Walking distance + Running distance
Total distance = 6 + 30 = 36 miles

So, Jasmine can travel 36 miles in 6 hours under these conditions.",6.0,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jasmine can skip at a rate of 6 miles per hour.

Since she can skip at a rate that is 3/5 as fast as she can run, we can find her running speed by dividing her skipping speed by 3/5.

Let's convert 3/5 to a decimal: 3/5 = 0.6

Now, we can divide her skipping speed by 0.6 to find her running speed:
6 miles/hour (skipping) ÷ 0.6 = 10 miles/hour (running)

Now, let's find out how much time she spends running and walking in 6 hours.

She spends 2/4 of the time running, which is equivalent to 1/2 of the time:
1/2 of 6 hours = 3 hours (running)

She spends 3/6 of the time walking, which is equivalent to 1/2 of the time:
1/2 of 6 hours = 3 hours (walking)

Now, let's calculate the total distance she travels while running and walking:

Distance running = Speed × Time = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles
Distance walking = Speed × Time = 2 miles/hour (we need to find her walking speed) × 3 hours

We know that she can walk 2/5 as fast as she can run. Since her running speed is 10 miles/hour, her walking speed is:
10 miles/hour × 2/5 = 4 miles/hour

Now, we can calculate the distance she travels while walking:
Distance walking = 4 miles/hour × 3 hours = 12 miles

The total distance she travels is the sum of the distance she travels while running and walking:
Total distance = 30 miles + 12 miles = 42 miles

The answer is 42.",42.0,0,"Here's the corrected solution:

Q: Jasmine can run five times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is 3/5 as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 6 hours if she spends 2/4 of the time running and three-sixths of the time walking?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's find out how fast Jasmine can run:
She can skip at 6 miles per hour, which is 3/5 as fast as she can run. So, her running speed is 6 / (3/5) = 6 * (5/3) = 10 miles per hour.

Next, let's find out how fast Jasmine can walk:
She can run five times faster than she can walk, so her walking speed is 10 / 5 = 2 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the time Jasmine spends running and walking in 6 hours:
She spends 2/4 of the time running, which is 2/4 * 6 = 3 hours.
She spends three-sixths of the time walking, which is 3/6 * 6 = 3 hours.

So, in 6 hours, Jasmine runs for 3 hours at 10 miles per hour and walks for 3 hours at 2 miles per hour.

Let's calculate the distance she covers while running:
Distance covered while running = Speed * Time = 10 * 3 = 30 miles.

Let's calculate the distance she covers while walking:
Distance covered while walking = Speed * Time = 2 * 3 = 6 miles.

Now, let's find the total distance she covers in 6 hours:
Total distance = Distance covered while running + Distance covered while walking = 30 + 6 = 36 miles.

If a 300 ounces bag has 5 servings, how many ounces can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2360 and you have already consumed 1700 calories?",144.0,"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many calories you can still consume, and then determine how many servings of bread you can eat. After that, we can calculate the total ounces of bread you can eat.

Step 1: Calculate the remaining daily calorie target
You have already consumed 1700 calories, and your daily calorie target is 2360. To find the remaining calories, subtract the consumed calories from the target:

Remaining calories = 2360 - 1700 = 660

Step 2: Calculate the number of servings of bread you can eat
Each serving of bread has 275 calories. To find out how many servings you can eat, divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:

Number of servings = 660 / 275 = 2.4

Since you can't eat a fraction of a serving, we'll round down to 2 servings.

Step 3: Calculate the total ounces of bread you can eat
The 300-ounce bag has 5 servings. To find out how many ounces are in one serving, divide the total ounces by the number of servings:

Ounces per serving = 300 / 5 = 60

Now, multiply the number of servings you can eat by the ounces per serving:

Total ounces = 2 * 60 = 120

Therefore, you can eat 120 ounces of bread.",120.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

We know a serving of bread has 275 calories. 
We also know the bag has 5 servings.
So, the total calories in the bag are 275 * 5 = 1375 calories.

You want to stay within your daily calorie target of 2360 and you've already consumed 1700 calories.
The remaining calories you can consume is 2360 - 1700 = 660 calories.

Since one serving has 275 calories, to find the ounces you can eat, we need to find out how many servings you can consume with 660 calories.
The number of servings you can eat is 660 / 275 = 2.4.

Since there are 5 servings in the bag, you can eat 2.4 servings. 
We know that 2 servings are 2 * 275 = 550 calories.
Since 660 / 275 is 2.4 and 2 servings are 550 calories, the extra 0.4 servings is 0.4 * 275 = 110 calories.
You want to reach 660 calories, so you can eat 2 servings (550 calories) and an additional 110 calories.

The 300 ounces bag is equally divided among the 5 servings.
Each serving is 300 / 5 = 60 ounces.

So, the answer is 2 servings of 60 ounces each (120 ounces) and an additional 110 / 275 * 60 ounces (it is 15.64 ounces of 60 ounces), however, since you can't eat a fraction of an ounce, you can eat 2 servings of 60 ounces each and then the remaining portion is 1 serving of 60 ounces.

Since we are only asked about the total ounces you can eat and we want to stay within the calorie limit of 2360, the answer is 2*60 + 60 = 180 ounces",180.0,0,"I see what you're asking for now.

Q: According to its nutritional info, a bag of breads has 275 calories per serving. If a 300 ounces bag has 5 servings, how many ounces can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2360 and you have already consumed 1700 calories?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's find out how many calories are left in the daily calorie target:
Daily calorie target = 2360 calories.
Calories already consumed = 1700 calories.
So, calories left = 2360 - 1700 = 660 calories.

Next, let's find out how many calories are in the bag of breads:
Number of servings = 5.
Calories per serving = 275.
So, total calories in the bag = 5 * 275 = 1375 calories.

Now, let's find out how many ounces of breads can be eaten to reach the remaining calorie target:
Calories left = 660.
Calories per serving = 275.
So, number of servings left = 660 / 275 = 2.4 servings.

Since there are 5 servings in the bag, we can find the number of ounces left by multiplying the number of servings left by the total number of ounces:
Number of servings left = 2.4.
Total number of servings = 5.
So, number of ounces left = 2.4 / 5 * 300 = 144 ounces.

Let's think step by step.
James sells lilies for €1.26 per bunch, but he will round this price to the nearest dollar. 
€1.26 is closer to €1 than €2, so he will round the price of lilies to €1 per bunch.
He sells daisies for €2.53 per bunch, which is closer to €2 than €3, so he will round the price of daisies to €2 per bunch.
He sells roses for €4.85 per bunch, which is closer to €5 than €4, so he will round the price of roses to €5 per bunch.
James sells 6 bunchs of lilies at €1 per bunch.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of potted plants Tara already has**

Tara has 9 potted plants on each of the 64 window ledges. To find the total number of potted plants she already has, we multiply the number of plants per ledge by the number of ledges:

9 plants/ledge × 64 ledges = 576 plants

1. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Theo watched a 6-hour episode each night, so he watched a total of 2 x 6 = 12 hours of TV.

2. On Thursday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes x. Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time he watched on Thursday is 30x minutes.

3. On Friday, he watched a 2-hour episode and a 30-minute show. The 2-hour episode is 120 minutes, and the 30-minute show is 30 minutes. So, the total time he watched on Friday is 120 + 30 = 150 minutes.

4. On Saturday, he watched three 4-hour episodes. Each episode is 240 minutes, so the total time he watched on Saturday is 3 x 240 = 720 minutes.

5. The total time he watched TV is 29 hours, which is equal to 1740 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).

6. We can set up an equation to represent the total time he watched TV:

12 + 30x + 150 + 720 = 1740

7. Simplify the equation:

12 + 30x + 150 + 720 = 1740
882 + 30x = 1740

8. Subtract 882 from both sides:

30x = 858

9. Divide both sides by 30:

x = 858 / 30
x = 28.6

Since x represents the number of episodes, it must be a whole number. However, we can see that 28.6 is close to 28 or 29 episodes. Let's try both values to see which one works.

If x = 28, then the total time he watched on Thursday is 30 x 28 = 840 minutes.

If x = 29, then the total time he watched on Thursday is 30 x 29 = 870 minutes.

We can see that if x = 28, the total time he watched on Thursday is less than 30x = 858, which is not possible. However, if x = 29, the total time he watched on Thursday is greater than 30x = 858, which is also not possible.

However, we can see that if x = 28, the total time he watched on Thursday is 840 minutes, which is less than 30x = 858. But if we add 30 minutes to the total time he watched on Thursday, we get 870 minutes, which is equal to 30x = 30(29) = 870. This means that x = 28.6 is actually the correct answer, but we need to round it down to the nearest whole number.

He watched three 4-hour episodes, so the total hours watched on Saturday is 3 * 4 = 12 hours.

Now, let's add up the total hours of TV watched on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday.
The total hours watched on these four days is 12 + 12 + 2.5 + 12 = 38.5 hours.

However, we know that Theo watched a total of 29 hours of TV. This means that the total hours watched on Thursday must be 38.5 - 29 = 9.5 hours.

On Thursday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes x. Since each episode is 30 minutes, or 0.5 hours, the total hours watched on Thursday is 0.5x.

We know that the total hours watched on Thursday is 9.5 hours, so we can set up the equation 0.5x = 9.5.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.5, which gives us x = 19.

So, Theo watched 19 episodes of the 30-minute show on Thursday.

The answer is 19.",19.0,0,"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Theo watched 29 hours of TV in total. We need to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Thursday.

Step 1:  We need to calculate the total number of hours he watched on Tuesday and Wednesday.
He watched 6 hours each night, so together he watched 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

Step 2:  We need to calculate the total number of hours he watched on Friday.
He watched a 2-hour episode and a 30-minute episode which is 0.5 hours. So, he watched 2.5 hours on Friday.

Step 3:  We need to calculate the total number of hours he watched on Saturday.
He watched 3 episodes of 4 hours each, so he watched 3 * 4 = 12 hours.

Step 4:  Now, we need to find out the total number of hours he watched on Thursday.
Total hours watched = 29 hours
Hours watched on Tuesday and Wednesday = 12 hours
Hours watched on Friday = 2.5 hours
Hours watched on Saturday = 12 hours
So, hours watched on Thursday = 29 - (12 + 2.5 + 12) = 29 - 26.5 = 2.5 hours

Step 5:  Now, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Thursday.
Since each episode is 0.5 hours, we can divide the total hours he watched on Thursday by 0.5.
So, the number of 30-minute episodes is 2.5 / 0.5 = 5.
The answer is 5.

Since the total number of parts in the ratio is equal to the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used, we can say that the ratio 53:24 represents the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used.

Let's say the number of teaspoons of sugar used is 53x and the number of cups of water used is 24x.

We know that the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is 77, so we can set up the equation:

53x + 24x = 77

Total number of outcomes: 6 (since a six-sided die has 6 faces)
Favorable outcomes (rolling a number greater than 3): 3 (4, 5, and 6)

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = Favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes = 3/6 = 0.5

To convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100:
Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 0.5 * 100 = 50%

Now, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 0.5 (since there are 3 even numbers: 2, 4, and 6).

Since we want two even numbers in a row, we need to multiply the probabilities of two consecutive events. The probability of the second event is also 0.5.

Probability of two even numbers in a row = (Probability of the first even number) * (Probability of the second even number) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25

Probability of two even numbers in a row = 0.25 * 100 = 25%

Let's break down the problem into two parts:

Part 1: The probability of rolling a number greater than 3.

A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6.

There are 3 favorable outcomes (rolling a 4, 5, or 6) and 6 possible outcomes (rolling any number from 1 to 6).

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

Part 2: The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2 and 4 and 6.

There are 3 favorable outcomes (rolling a 2, 4, or 6) for the first roll, and 2 favorable outcomes (rolling a 2 or 4) for the second roll.

So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6) * (2/6) = 6/36 = 1/6 = 0.1667 or approximately 16.67%.

Now, let's find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

Q: Umar is rolling a six-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?

To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the favorable outcomes (numbers 4, 5, and 6) and divide by the total number of outcomes (6).

There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) and 6 total outcomes. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to count the favorable outcomes (even numbers 2, 4, and 6) and divide by the total number of outcomes (6). Then, we need to square the probability because we are rolling the die twice.

The probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%. Squaring this probability gives (0.5)^2 = 0.25 or 25%.

First, we need to find the number of caterpillars. We know that there are four-sixths as many caterpillars as ladybugs.
Four-sixths can be written as 4/6, which simplifies to 2/3.

Ms. Johnson's budget is $480000.
The selling price of the apartment is $410000.
The brokerage fee is 6% of the selling price.

   Transfer fees = 0.04 * $620,000
   Transfer fees = $24,800

2. Calculate the brokerage fees:
   Brokerage fees = 3% of the selling price
   Brokerage fees = 0.03 * $620,000
   Brokerage fees = $18,600

3. Calculate the total fees:

   Total fees = $24,800 + $18,600
   Total fees = $43,400

4. Calculate the net proceeds:
   Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees - Remaining loan amount
   Net proceeds = $620,000 - $43,400 - $520,000
   Net proceeds = $56,600

So, Mr. Williams's net proceeds from selling the condo are $56,600.",56600.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Mr. Williams sold his condo for $620,000.

He paid transfer fees that amount to 4% of the selling price.
4% of $620,000 is 0.04 x $620,000 = $24,800.
So, the transfer fees are $24,800.

He also paid a brokerage fee that is 3% of the selling price.
3% of $620,000 is 0.03 x $620,000 = $18,600.
So, the brokerage fee is $18,600.

The total amount paid in fees is $24,800 + $18,600 = $43,400.

He also paid $520,000 for the remaining loan amount of the condo.

So, the total amount paid is $43,400 + $520,000 = $563,400.

How many engineers are left if 26 artists stayed at the conference?",66.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Initially, there were 64 artists and 51 engineers, so the total number of people at the conference was:

64 (artists) + 51 (engineers) = 115

After half an hour, one-fifth of the total number of people left. To find the number of people who left, we need to calculate one-fifth of the total number of people:

1/5 × 115 = 23

So, 23 people left the conference.

Now, let's find out how many artists and engineers were left. We know that 26 artists stayed at the conference. Since 23 people left, the number of artists who left is:

64 (initial artists) - 26 (artists who stayed) = 38

So, 38 artists left the conference.

Now, let's find out how many engineers were left. We know that 23 people left in total, and 38 artists left. To find the number of engineers who left, we need to subtract the number of artists who left from the total number of people who left:

23 (total people who left) - 38 (artists who left) = -15

However, we can't have a negative number of engineers who left. This means that the number of engineers who left is actually 38 - 23 = 15.

So, the number of engineers who left is 15.

Now, let's find out how many engineers are left. We know that there were 51 engineers initially, and 15 engineers left. To find the number of engineers who are left, we need to subtract the number of engineers who left from the initial number of engineers:

The roller coaster cost $11 a ride. How many friends can she invite?",1.0,"To find the number of friends Sofia can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

1. Cost of laser tag: 1 round per person, at $6 per round, and we don't know the number of friends yet. So let's represent it as 6x, where x is the number of friends.
2. Sofia also wants $6 in pinball tokens, which is a fixed amount, not dependent on the number of friends.
3. Cost of roller coaster rides: 8 rides at $11 per ride. So the total cost for roller coaster rides will be 8 * 11 = $88.
4. Sofia has $200 budgeted, and pinball tokens are $6. So the remaining budget for laser tag and roller coaster rides is 200 - 6 - 88 = $106.

Now, let's represent the total budget for laser tag as 6x. Then we can write an equation to find x:
6x + 106 = 106 (combined total cost of laser tag and roller coaster rides)

Now we can solve the equation:
6x = 106 - 106
6x = 0
x = 0 / 6 (we can't have a negative number of friends, this is an error in calculation. Since 106 is less than 106, there must be an error in the calculation. The roller coaster cost is $11 a ride, and it costs $106 to ride it 8 times, that indicates the cost of the laser tag is actually 0 and not 6x. The total budget for pinball and roller coaster is 106. The laser tag is 0 so the cost of pinball and roller coaster is $106. The cost of pinball is $6, therefore the cost of the roller coaster is $100. However, the roller coaster costs $88, that is a contradiction, therefore the initial statement is false.)

However, if we can assume the initial statement is true, and correct the statement we can then calculate it:

The cost for the roller coaster is $88, and we know the cost of the pinball tokens. 106 - 88 = $18 is the budget left for laser tag.

Since the cost of laser tag is $6 per round, and we want to know how many friends she can invite, we can divide the budget left for laser tag ($18) by the cost of laser tag ($6):
 $18 / $6 = 3

So she can invite 3 friends.",3.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Sofia's mom has a budget of $200.
She wants to spend $6 on pinball tokens.
She wants to ride the roller coaster 8 times, and each ride costs $11.

The total cost for pinball tokens and the roller coaster is 88 + 6 = 94.
The cost for laser tag is $6 per round, and she wants to play one round, so the total cost for laser tag is 6.
The total cost for all activities is 94 + 6 = 100.
So, the remaining budget for friends is 200 - 100 = 100.
A round of laser tag costs $6, and she wants to invite friends to play one round, so each friend will cost 6.

Q: Sofia's mom said that she had $200 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of laser tag, have $6 in pinball tokens, and get to ride the roller coaster eight times. A round of laser tag is $6. The roller coaster cost $11 a ride. How many friends can she invite?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the roller coaster rides.
The roller coaster costs $11 per ride, and Sofia wants to ride it 8 times.
So, the total cost of the roller coaster rides is 8 * 11 = 88.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the laser tag and pinball tokens.
A round of laser tag costs $6, and Sofia wants to play it once.
She also wants $6 in pinball tokens.
So, the total cost of the laser tag and pinball tokens is 6 + 6 = 12.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the party.
The total cost of the party is the sum of the cost of the roller coaster rides and the cost of the laser tag and pinball tokens.
So, the total cost of the party is 88 + 12 = 100.

Since Sofia's mom has a budget of $200, and the total cost of the party is $100, we can subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left.
However, the question asks how many friends Sofia can invite, not how much money is left. To find the number of friends Sofia can invite, we need to subtract the total cost of the party from the budget and then divide by the cost per person.

Let's assume the cost per person is the cost of the laser tag, which is $6. We can subtract the total cost of the party from the budget and then divide by the cost per person.
However, this is not the correct approach. The correct approach is to subtract the cost of the roller coaster rides and the laser tag and pinball tokens from the budget and then divide by the cost per person.

Let's calculate the cost per person.
The cost per person is the cost of the roller coaster rides and the laser tag and pinball tokens, which is 88 + 12 = 100.

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the party from the budget and then divide by the cost per person.
The budget is $200, and the cost per person is $100.
So, the number of friends Sofia can invite is 200 / 100 = 2.

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider the cost of the roller coaster rides and the laser tag and pinball tokens separately.

Let's calculate the number of friends Sofia can invite for the roller coaster rides.
The roller coaster costs $11 per ride, and Sofia wants to ride it 8 times.
So, the total cost of the roller coaster rides is 8 * 11 = 88.
The budget is $200, and the cost of the roller coaster rides is $88.
So, the number of friends Sofia can invite for the roller coaster rides is 200 / 88 = 2.27 (round down to 2, since you can't invite a fraction of a person).

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider the cost of the laser tag and pinball tokens separately.

Let's calculate the number of friends Sofia can invite for the laser tag and pinball tokens.
The laser tag costs $6 per person, and Sofia wants to play it once.
She also wants $6 in pinball tokens.
So, the total cost of the laser tag and pinball tokens is 6 + 6 = 12.
The budget is $200, and the cost of the laser tag and pinball tokens is $12.
So, the number of friends Sofia can invite for the laser tag and pinball tokens is 200 / 12 = 16.67 (round down to 16, since you can't invite a fraction of a person).

4. The painter gets paid ₣180 every day.

First, let's calculate the number of days the painter works in a year:
- Since the painter works for 2 weeks every month and there are 12 months in a year, he works for 2 * 12 = 24 weeks in a year.

Wei starts with 38 bananas.
He buys 46 more bananas.
So, the total number of bananas is 38 + 46 = 84.

Wei has 10 times as many plums as bananas initially, which is 10 * 38 = 380 plums.

Then, he buys 45 fewer plums than the number of bananas. Since he has 84 bananas, he buys 84 - 45 = 39 fewer plums, but since he already had 380, it seems like the statement should be interpreted as 45 fewer than the number of bananas purchased (not the initial number). This means he buys 84 - 45 = 39 more plums than the initial number, so 380 + 39 = 419 plums in total.

However, the correct interpretation of the sentence should be he buys 45 fewer plums than the number of bananas that he purchased which is 46, so 46 - 45 = 1 fewer plum than the bananas he bought, so the correct number of plums should be 380 - 1 = 379 plums.

So, the total number of bananas is 84.

The original price of 5 kgs of fudge is 5 * ¥21 = ¥105.
The discount is 2/3 of ¥105, which is (2/3) * ¥105 = ¥70.

So, the number of pretzels he bought is ₣920 / ₣1 = 920.

Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Liam spent ₣",920.0,0,"Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.

Liam spent ₣1000 and had 8% of his money left, meaning he spent 100% - 8% = 92% of his money. 

The cost of popcorn is 25 cents. Liam bought 4 bags of popcorn. 
So, the total amount spent on popcorn is 4 * 25 cents = 100 cents.

Let's convert the total amount spent (in cents) to dollars since Liam's money is in ₣ (which is not a standard unit of currency so we can assume you are working in dollars).
₣1 is equal to 100 cents (dollar).
So, ₣1000 is 1000 cents or 10 dollars.

We know Liam spent 92% of his money, which is 92% of 10 dollars. 
So, the amount he spent is 0.92 * 10 = $9.2.

He also spent $0.1 on popcorn.

Now, let's find the amount he spent on pretzels. 
The amount spent on pretzels is the total amount spent minus the amount spent on popcorn.
So, the amount spent on pretzels is $9.2 - $0.1 = $9.1.

Now, we know the cost of a pretzel is 100 cents or $1. 
So, the number of pretzels Liam bought is the amount spent on pretzels divided by the cost of a pretzel.
The number of pretzels is $9.1 / $1 = 9.1.

However, you cannot buy 0.1 of a pretzel. Let's re-evaluate the problem to find a more accurate solution.

We know Liam spent 92% of his money. This means he spent 92% of ₣1000. 
So, the amount he spent is 0.92 * ₣1000 = ₣920.

He spent ₣920.

Now, let's find the amount he spent on pretzels.
We know he spent ₣920 in total and $0.1 on popcorn.
So, the amount he spent on pretzels is ₣920 - ₣0.1 (or ₣0.1 * 10 since ₣0.1 is in dollars and ₣ is not a standard unit of currency so we convert it back to ₣) = ₣920 - ₣1 = ₣919.

We know the cost of a pretzel is ₣1 or 100 cents.
So, the number of pretzels Liam bought is the amount spent on pretzels divided by the cost of a pretzel.
The number of pretzels is ₣919 / ₣1 = 919.",919.0,1

Q: The area of Andre's rectangular study is 660 square meters. If the length of his room is 5 meters, what is the perimeter of the room in meters?

A: Let's think step by step.
We know the area of the room is 660 square meters.
The formula for the area of a rectangle is length * width.
We are given the length of the room as 5 meters.
Let's call the width of the room ""w"".
So, the area of the room is 5 * w = 660.
To find the width, we need to divide both sides by 5.
w = 660 / 5 = 132.
Now that we know the width, we can find the perimeter of the room.
The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width).
Substituting the values, we get:
Perimeter = 2 * (5 + 132) = 2 * 137 = 274.

How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?",408.0,"To solve this problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. There are 80 orange cards.

2. There are 55% more blue cards. Let's find the number of blue cards.
   First, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal. 55% = 55/100 = 0.55
   Then, we multiply the number of orange cards by the decimal to find 55% of 80. 
   55% of 80 = 80 * 0.55 = 44
   This means there are 55% more blue cards than orange cards, so the number of blue cards is the original number of orange cards plus 55% of the number of orange cards.
   Number of blue cards = 80 + 44 = 124

3. Green cards are as many as the sum of orange and blue cards. 
   Sum of orange and blue cards = 80 + 124 = 204
   Therefore, the number of green cards is also 204.

4. To find the total number of cards, we need to add the number of cards of all three colors.
   Total number of cards = 80 (orange) + 124 (blue) + 204 (green) = 408

So, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is 408.",408.0,1,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

First, let's find out how many blue cards there are. We know that there are 55% more blue cards than orange cards. To find 55% of the number of orange cards, we multiply the number of orange cards by 0.55.

Let's think step by step.
There are 80 orange cards.
55% more blue cards than orange cards means we need to find 55% of 80.
55% of 80 is 0.55 * 80 = 44.
So, there are 44 more blue cards than orange cards.

Now, let's find the total number of blue cards. We know that there are 44 more blue cards than orange cards, so we add 44 to the number of orange cards.

Let's think step by step.
There are 80 orange cards.
There are 44 more blue cards than orange cards.
So, the total number of blue cards is 80 + 44 = 124.

Next, let's find the total number of green cards. We know that the number of green cards is equal to the sum of orange and blue cards.

Let's think step by step.
The total number of orange cards is 80.
The total number of blue cards is 124.
So, the total number of green cards is 80 + 124 = 204.

Mateo's dog has 120 puppies with spots.
So, the total number of puppies with spots is 190 + 120 = 310.

Now, we need to find the percentage of puppies with spots.
To do this, we'll divide the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies, and then multiply by 100.
So, the percentage of puppies with spots is (310 / 1550) * 100.

To simplify the division, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10.
So, (310 / 1550) = (31 / 155) = 0.2.
Now, we multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

1. Total number of students = 116
2. Number of students who like to play video games = 14
3. Number of students who like to play hurling = 28
4. Number of students who like to dance or paint = Total number of students - (Number of students who like to play video games + Number of students who like to play hurling)

Out of the remaining class, 35% of the students are debate team members or part of dancers. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away meet. How many students are leaving early?",48.0,"To find out how many students are leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and then add them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of swimmers**

20% of 100 students are swimmers. To find 20% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.20.

100 x 0.20 = 20

So, 20 students are swimmers.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of remaining students**

Since 20 students are swimmers, we subtract them from the total number of students to find the remaining students.

100 - 20 = 80

**Step 3: Calculate the number of debate team members or dancers**

35% of the remaining 80 students are debate team members or dancers. To find 35% of 80, we multiply 80 by 0.35.

80 x 0.35 = 28

So, 28 students are debate team members or dancers.

**Step 4: Add up the number of students in each group**

To find the total number of students leaving early, we add up the number of swimmers, debate team members, and dancers.

20 (swimmers) + 28 (debate team members or dancers) = 48

Therefore, 48 students are leaving early to travel to an away meet.",48.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

To find out how many students are leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in the three groups: swimmers, debate team members or dancers, and the ones that are a part of both groups (which we will subtract later to avoid double counting).

First, let's find out how many swimmers there are in the class.
20% of the class are swimmers. So, we need to find 20% of 100.
To find 20% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.20.
0.20 * 100 = 20
So, there are 20 swimmers in the class.

Now, let's find out how many students are debate team members or dancers.
35% of the remaining students are debate team members or dancers. To find the remaining students, we subtract the swimmers from the total.
There are 100 students in total and 20 swimmers.
So, the remaining students are 100 - 20 = 80.

Now, we find 35% of the remaining 80 students.
To find 35% of 80, we multiply 80 by 0.35.
0.35 * 80 = 28
So, there are 28 students who are either debate team members or dancers.

However, we need to find out how many students are in both groups, to avoid double-counting. To do that, we need to find the overlap between swimmers and debate team members or dancers. But since the question doesn't specify any overlap, we will assume that the 20 swimmers and 28 debate team members or dancers are mutually exclusive.

Now, let's find the total number of students leaving early.
We add the number of swimmers and the number of debate team members or dancers.
20 (swimmers) + 28 (debate team members or dancers) = 48 students are leaving early.

However, we need to check if the question asks for any students who are in both groups to be subtracted from this total. Since the question states ""or"" instead of ""and"", it implies that students that are part of both groups are included in the 48 students and we don't need to subtract any.

Q: Kimia has a flower bed that is 180 feet long. Kimia wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Kimia's flowers grow 3 feet wide so she needs to leave 15.0 feet between every plant. Kimia already owns 11 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ¥3 at the store, how much money will Kimia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many plants Kimia can fit in her flower bed. To do this, we need to find the total space available for plants, which is the length of the flower bed minus the space between each plant.

The space between each plant is 15.0 feet, and the width of each plant is 3 feet. So, the total space available for each plant is 15.0 + 3 = 18.0 feet.

However, we need to consider that the plants are not placed at the edges of the flower bed, but rather in the middle. Therefore, we need to subtract the width of the plant from the total space available for each plant.

Let's assume the number of plants Kimia can fit in her flower bed is x. Then, the total space occupied by the plants is 3x (since each plant is 3 feet wide).

The total space available for plants is 180 feet, so we can set up the equation:

3x + 18x = 180

Combine like terms:

21x = 180

Divide both sides by 21:

x = 180 / 21
x = 8.57 (round down to 8, since we can't have a fraction of a plant)

However, this is not the correct approach. Let's try again.

The total space available for each plant is 15.0 + 3 = 18.0 feet. However, we need to consider that the plants are not placed at the edges of the flower bed, but rather in the middle. Therefore, we need to subtract the width of the plant from the total space available for each plant.

Let's assume the number of plants Kimia can fit in her flower bed is x. Then, the total space occupied by the plants is 3x (since each plant is 3 feet wide).

The total space available for plants is 180 feet, so we can set up the equation:

3x + (x - 1) * 18 = 180

Simplify the equation:

3x + 18x - 18 = 180

Combine like terms:

21x - 18 = 180

Add 18 to both sides:

21x = 198

Divide both sides by 21:

x = 198 / 21
x = 9.43 (round down to 9, since we can't have a fraction of a plant)

**Peeling 90 clams:**

Fatima can peel 10 clams per minute. To find out how long it will take her to peel 90 clams, we can divide 90 by 10:

90 ÷ 10 = 9 minutes

So, it will take Fatima 9 minutes to peel 90 clams.

**Sauteing 90 clams:**

Fatima can saute 30 clams in 7 minutes. To find out how long it will take her to saute 90 clams, we can divide 90 by 30:

90 ÷ 30 = 3

Since 3 is less than 7, it will take Fatima less than 7 minutes to saute 90 clams. To be more precise, we can multiply 3 by 7 (the time it takes to saute 30 clams) and subtract the result from 7:

7 - (3 × 7) = 7 - 21 = -14 (this doesn't make sense, so we'll try another approach)

Fatima can peel 10 clams a minute.
She can peel 10 clams per minute, and she needs to peel 90 clams.
So, the time it takes for her to peel 90 clams is 90 / 10 = 9 minutes.

She can saute 30 clams in 7 minutes.
She needs to saute 90 clams.
Since she can saute 30 clams in 7 minutes, we can find out how many sets of 30 clams she needs to saute: 90 / 30 = 3.
So, she needs to saute 3 sets of 30 clams, which takes 3 * 7 = 21 minutes.

Since peeling and sauteing are done separately, we add the time it takes for both tasks: 9 minutes (peeling) + 21 minutes (sauteing) = 30 minutes.

2. Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. This means Viktor was 3 × 23 = 69 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time.
3. Since the Comet orbits the sun every 55 years, Viktor's father saw the Comet 55 years before Viktor saw it for the second time.
4. To find out how old Viktor was when he saw the Comet for the first time, we need to subtract 55 years from Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the second time: 69 - 55 = 14 years old.

So, Viktor was 14 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.",14.0,1,"I'll follow the format you provided to solve the problem step by step.

Q: Comet Hale-Bopp orbits the sun every 55 years. Viktor's father saw the Comet when he was 23 years old. Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. How old was Viktor when he saw the Comet for the first time?

A: Let's think step by step.
Viktor's father saw the Comet when he was 23 years old.
This means that the Comet had orbited the sun 23 times since Viktor's father saw it.
Since the Comet orbits the sun every 55 years, we can find the number of years that have passed since Viktor's father saw the Comet:
23 years * 55 years/orbit = 1265 years
This is the number of years that have passed since Viktor's father saw the Comet.
Now, we need to find Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the second time. We are told that he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.
Viktor's father was 23 years old when he saw the Comet, so Viktor was 3 * 23 = 69 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time.
Since the Comet orbits the sun every 55 years, we can find the number of years that have passed since Viktor's father saw the Comet:
69 years / 55 years/orbit = 1.25 orbits
This means that 1.25 orbits have passed since Viktor's father saw the Comet.
Now, we can find the number of years that have passed since Viktor's father saw the Comet:
1.25 orbits * 55 years/orbit = 68.75 years
This is the number of years that have passed since Viktor's father saw the Comet.
Since Viktor was 69 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time, we can find his age when he saw the Comet for the first time:
69 years - 68.75 years = 0.25 years
However, this is not possible, as Viktor's age must be a whole number.
Let's re-examine the problem. We are told that Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. This means that Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the second time is 3 times his father's age when he saw the Comet.
Let's call Viktor's father's age when he saw the Comet ""x"". Then, Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the second time is 3x.
Since the Comet orbits the sun every 55 years, we can find the number of years that have passed since Viktor's father saw the Comet:
x years * 55 years/orbit = 55x years
This is the number of years that have passed since Viktor's father saw the Comet.
Now, we can find Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the first time:
Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the second time = 3x
Number of years that have passed since Viktor's father saw the Comet = 55x
We are given that Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. This means that:
3x = 3(23) + 55x
Simplifying the equation, we get:
3x = 69 + 55x
Subtracting 55x from both sides, we get:
-52x = 69
Dividing both sides by -52, we get:
x = -69/52
x = -1.33
However, this is not possible, as Viktor's father's age when he saw the Comet must be a whole number.
Let's re-examine the problem again. We are told that Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. This means that Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the second time is 3 times his father's age when he saw the Comet.
Let's call Viktor's father's age when he saw the Comet ""x"". Then, Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the second time is 3x.
Since the Comet orbits the sun every 55 years, we can find the number of years that have passed since Viktor's father saw the Comet:
x years * 55 years/orbit = 55x years
This is the number of years that have passed since Viktor's father saw the Comet.
Now, we can find Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the first time:
Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the second time = 3x
Number of years that have passed since Viktor's father saw the Comet = 55x
We are given that Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. This means that:
3x = 3(23) + 55x - 55
Simplifying the equation, we get:
3x = 69 + 55x - 55
3x = 14 + 55x
Subtracting 55x from both sides, we get:
-52x = 14
Dividing both sides by -52, we get:
x = -14/52
x = -7/26
However, this is not possible, as Viktor's father's age when he saw the Comet must be a whole number.
Let's re-examine the problem again. We are told that Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. This means that Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the second time is 3 times his father's age when he saw the Comet.

This is the number of years that have passed since Viktor's father saw the Comet.
Now, we can find Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the first time:
Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the second time = 3x
Number of years that have passed since Viktor's father saw the Comet = 55x
We are given that Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. This means that:
3x = 3(23) + 55x - 55k
where k is the number of times the Comet has orbited the sun since Viktor's father saw it.
Simplifying the equation, we get:
3x = 69 + 55x - 55k
3x - 55x = 69 - 55k
-52x = 69 - 55k
52k - 52x = 69
52(k - x) = 69
k - x = 69/52
k - x = 1.33
Since k and x must be whole numbers, this equation has no solution.

Q: Comet Hale-Bopp orbits the sun every 55 years. Viktor's father saw the Comet when he was 23 years old. Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. How old was Viktor when he saw the Comet for the first time?

A: Let's think step by step.
Viktor's father saw the Comet when he was 23 years old.
Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.
So, Viktor was 3 * 23 = 69 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time.
We are asked to find Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the first time.
Since Viktor was 69 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time, we need to subtract the time that passed between the two sightings from Viktor's age at the second sighting.
Comet Hale-Bopp orbits the sun every 55 years, so the time between the two sightings is 55 years.
So, Viktor was 69 - 55 = 14 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.

**Step 1: Calculate the total minutes Hiroshi spends in class per day**

Hiroshi takes 2 extra classes, each 35 minutes long, in addition to the 7 periods. So, he has 7 + 2 = 9 periods per day.

Each period is 35 minutes long, so the total minutes per day is:
9 periods/day × 35 minutes/period = 315 minutes/day

**Step 2: Calculate the total minutes Hiroshi spends in class per week**

Hiroshi goes to class for 4 days a week, so the total minutes per week is:
315 minutes/day × 4 days/week = 1260 minutes/week

**Step 3: Calculate the extra learning time Hiroshi spends on Saturday and Sunday**

Add the minutes spent in class to the extra learning time:
1260 minutes/week (in class) + 630 minutes/week (extra learning) = 1890 minutes/week

**Step 5: Convert the total minutes to hours**

Therefore, Hiroshi spends 31.5 hours per week learning.",31.5,0,"Let's think step by step.

Hiroshi takes 2 extra classes, each class being 35 minutes long.
He attends these extra classes for 4 days a week.
The total time spent in class for the extra classes in one day is 2 * 35 = 70 minutes.
The total time spent in the extra classes for 4 days is 70 * 4 = 280 minutes.

For the regular classes, a normal student has 7 periods a day, and each period is 35 minutes long.
The total time spent in class for a normal student in a day is 7 * 35 = 245 minutes.
However, Hiroshi has to attend 2 extra classes instead of the 7 periods.

So, the total number of minutes spent in extra classes per week is 70 * 4 = 280 minutes.
He spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.
Since he spends 280 minutes in class, his weekly minutes are 280 + 280 = 560 minutes.
Three-sixths of 560 minutes is (3/6) * 560 = 280 minutes.
So, the total number of minutes spent learning per week is 280 + 280 = 560 minutes.

On the sidewalk, Emma walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 27-mile walk, in minutes?",90.0,"To solve this problem, we need to find Emma's speed on the beach and on the sidewalk, and then use that information to find the total time it takes her to complete the walk.

Step 1: Find Emma's speed on the beach.
Let's denote Emma's speed on the beach as 'b' miles per hour. Since she walks 11 miles on the beach, the time it takes her to walk on the beach is 11 / b hours.

We are given that 66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60:
66 minutes / 60 = 1.1 hours

Now we can set up an equation:
11 / b = 1.1

To solve for 'b', we multiply both sides by 'b' and then divide by 1.1:
b = 11 / 1.1
b = 10 miles per hour

Step 2: Find Emma's speed on the sidewalk.
We are given that Emma walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk is 4b:
4b = 4 * 10
4b = 40 miles per hour

Step 3: Find the time it takes Emma to walk on the sidewalk.
The time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk is 16 miles / 40 miles per hour:
16 / 40 = 0.4 hours

To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60:
0.4 hours * 60 = 24 minutes

Step 4: Find the total time it takes Emma to complete the walk.
The total time is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
1.1 hours + 0.4 hours = 1.5 hours

To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60:
1.5 hours * 60 = 90 minutes

Therefore, it takes Emma 90 minutes to complete the entire 27-mile walk.",27.0,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Emma walks 27 miles in total, which includes 11 miles on the beach and 16 miles on the sidewalk.

Let's start by finding out how long it takes her to walk on the beach. We know that she walks 11 miles on the beach, and we are given that 66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. We can use this information to find her speed on the beach.

Let's assume that Emma's speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Then, the time it takes her to walk 11 miles on the beach is 11/x minutes. We are given that this time is equal to 66 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

11/x = 66

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by x, which gives us:

11 = 66x

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 66 to solve for x:

x = 11/66

x = 1/6

So, Emma's speed on the beach is 1/6 miles per minute.

Now, let's find out how long it takes her to walk on the sidewalk. We know that she walks 16 miles on the sidewalk, and we know that her speed on the sidewalk is four times her speed on the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk is 4(1/6) = 2/3 miles per minute.

The time it takes her to walk 16 miles on the sidewalk is 16 / (2/3) = 16 * (3/2) = 24 minutes.

Now, we can find the total time it takes her to complete the entire 27-mile walk. We know that she spends 66 minutes on the beach and 24 minutes on the sidewalk, so the total time is:

66 + 24 = 90 minutes

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs Winnie eats in the first 60 days**

Winnie eats 4 eggs per day for 60 days, so the total number of eggs eaten in the first 60 days is:
4 eggs/day × 60 days = 240 eggs

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of eggs Winnie eats in the next 96 days**

Winnie eats 5 eggs per day for 96 days, so the total number of eggs eaten in the next 96 days is:
5 eggs/day × 96 days = 480 eggs

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of eggs Winnie eats in 156 days**

To find the total number of eggs eaten in 156 days, we add the number of eggs eaten in the first 60 days and the next 96 days:
240 eggs + 480 eggs = 720 eggs

**Step 4: Convert the total number of eggs to dozens**

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12:

Since Tariq initially hid 9 dozen eggs, let's convert it to a normal number. 
   9 dozen eggs = 9 * 12 = 108 eggs

Now, let's find the number of eggs still hidden in the yard.
   Eggs still hidden = Initial number of eggs - Total eggs found

   Eggs still hidden = 56

Therefore, 56 eggs are still hidden in the yard for the Easter egg hunt.",56.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many eggs Tariq hid in total. Since he hid 9 dozen eggs, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can multiply 9 by 12 to find the total number of eggs.

9 dozen eggs = 9 * 12 = 108 eggs

Now, let's find out how many eggs each person found.

Noah finds 5 eggs.

Emma finds four times as many as Noah, so Emma finds 4 * 5 = 20 eggs.

Olivia finds 2 less than Emma, so Olivia finds 20 - 2 = 18 eggs.

Alejandro finds 1/2 as many as Olivia, so Alejandro finds 18 / 2 = 9 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs each person found to find the total number of eggs that are no longer hidden.

5 (Noah) + 20 (Emma) + 18 (Olivia) + 9 (Alejandro) = 52 eggs

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the first 3 complexes**

The first 3 complexes have 300 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these complexes is:
300 + 300 + 300 = 900 apartments

**Step 2: Calculate the number of apartments in the last complex**

The last complex is 35% bigger than the other 3 combined, which means it is 135% of the other 3 combined (100% + 35% = 135%). To find the number of apartments in the last complex, we multiply the total number of apartments in the first 3 complexes by 1.35:
900 x 1.35 = 1215 apartments

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of apartments**

Now, let's find the number of apartments in the last complex, which is 35% bigger than the other 3 combined.
First, we find 35% of 900, which is 0.35 * 900 = 315.

After Oscar takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Oscar have to eat?",285.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: First 22 seconds**

* 30 kernels pop in the first 22 seconds.

**Step 2: Next 22 seconds**

* The kernels pop 2 times the amount in the first 22 seconds, which is:
	+ 2 x 30 = 60 kernels
* Total kernels popped so far: 30 + 60 = 90 kernels

**Step 3: Next 22 seconds**

* The kernels pop 4 times the initial popping rate, which is:
	+ 4 x 30 = 120 kernels
* Total kernels popped so far: 90 + 120 = 210 kernels

**Step 4: Final 22 seconds**

* The kernels pop at half the rate of the past 22 seconds, which is:
	+ 120 / 2 = 60 kernels
* Total kernels popped so far: 210 + 60 = 270 kernels

**Step 5: Residual heat**

* A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds also pop from the residual heat, which is:
	+ 60 / 4 = 15 kernels
* Total kernels popped: 270 + 15 = 285 kernels

Therefore, Oscar has 285 pieces of popcorn to eat.",285.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The initial popping rate is 30 kernels in 22 seconds.

In the next 22 seconds, the kernels pop at twice the initial rate. 
So, the number of kernels that popped in the next 22 seconds is 2 * 30 = 60.
The total number of kernels popped so far is 30 + 60 = 90.

In the next 22 seconds, the kernels pop at 4 times the initial rate. 
So, the number of kernels that popped in this 22 seconds is 4 * 30 = 120.
The total number of kernels popped so far is 90 + 120 = 210.

In the final 22 seconds, the kernels pop at half the rate of the past 22 seconds. 
So, the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds is 120 / 2 = 60.
The total number of kernels popped is 210 + 60 = 270.

After the pot is taken off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds pop from the residual heat. 
So, the number of additional kernels is 60 / 4 = 15.
The total number of kernels that popped is 270 + 15 = 285.

1. The stack is made of 4 purple tiles.
2. There are twice as many pink tiles as purple tiles. So, the number of pink tiles is 2 * 4 = 8.
3. Let's denote the number of green tiles as 'g'.
4. The total number of tiles is 4 (purple) + 8 (pink) + g (green). We are given that the total number of tiles is 30, so we can write an equation: 4 + 8 + g = 30.
5. Simplify the equation by combining the constants: 12 + g = 30.
6. To isolate 'g', subtract 12 from both sides of the equation: g = 30 - 12.
7. Solve for 'g': g = 18.

There are 18 green tiles.",18.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Weight of car: 1700 pounds
Weight of luggage: 450 pounds
Weight of children (2 x 75 pounds): 150 pounds

Total weight: 1700 + 450 + 150 = 2300 pounds

Now, we need to find 4% of the total weight, which is the force needed to move the car:

4% of 2300 pounds = 0.04 x 2300 = 92 pounds

So, Pavel needs to push the car with a force of 92 pounds.",92.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

To find the total weight of the car, Pavel, and his children, we need to add the weight of the car to the weight of the luggage and the children.

The weight of the car is 1700 pounds.
The weight of the luggage is 450 pounds.
The weight of the two children is 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds.

So, the total weight is 1700 + 450 + 150 = 2300 pounds.

Now, we need to find 4% of the total weight to determine the force required to move the car.

To find 4% of 2300, we multiply 2300 by 0.04.

Since Daphne is 72 years old and they are 16 years apart, we can find Alejandro's age by adding 16 to Daphne's age:

Alejandro's age = Daphne's age + 16
Alejandro's age = 72 + 16
Alejandro's age = 88

Now that we have the ages of both Daphne and Alejandro, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2:
