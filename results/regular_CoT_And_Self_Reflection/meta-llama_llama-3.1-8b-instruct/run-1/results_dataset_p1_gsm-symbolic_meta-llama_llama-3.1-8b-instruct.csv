She bought 6 dozen croissants which cost $19 per dozen, 4 dozen macarons which cost $77 per dozen, and 3 dozen brownies for $118 per dozen. How much was the total cost if she received 25% discount on all purchases?",582.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of each type of baked good**

* 6 dozen croissants at $19 per dozen: 6 x $19 = $114
* 4 dozen macarons at $77 per dozen: 4 x $77 = $308
* 3 dozen brownies at $118 per dozen: 3 x $118 = $354

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost before discount**

Add up the costs of all the baked goods: $114 + $308 + $354 = $776

**Step 3: Calculate the discount**

Beatriz received a 25% discount on all purchases. To calculate the discount, multiply the total cost by 0.25 (which is the same as 25%): $776 x 0.25 = $194

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost after discount**

Subtract the discount from the total cost: $776 - $194 = $582

Therefore, the total cost of Beatriz's purchases after the 25% discount is $582.",582.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the baked goods before the discount.

Beatriz bought 6 dozen croissants at $19 per dozen.
So, the cost of the croissants is 6 * $19 = $114.

She bought 4 dozen macarons at $77 per dozen.
So, the cost of the macarons is 4 * $77 = $308.

She bought 3 dozen brownies at $118 per dozen.
So, the cost of the brownies is 3 * $118 = $354.

The total cost before the discount is $114 + $308 + $354 = $776.

Now, we need to calculate the discount. Beatriz received a 25% discount on all purchases.
So, the discount amount is 25% of $776, which is 0.25 * $776 = $194.

The total cost after the discount is $776 - $194 = $582.

The answer is $582.",582.0,1,,582.0,1

But as I pour it, I spill 7 liters of the mango drink. To make up for that, I add 7 liters of water to the mix. What percentage of the final mix is water?",50.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Initial amounts:**

* Mango drink: 16 liters (1/9 water)
* Apple drink: 14 liters (1/2 water)

**Spill and addition:**

* You spill 7 liters of mango drink, so you're left with:
	+ 16 - 7 = 9 liters of mango drink
* You add 7 liters of water to make up for the spill, so the total amount of mango drink is now:
	+ 9 + 7 = 16 liters (still 1/9 water)
* The apple drink remains at 14 liters (1/2 water)

**Total mix:**

* Mango drink: 16 liters (1/9 water)
* Apple drink: 14 liters (1/2 water)
* Total mix: 16 + 14 = 30 liters

**Water content:**

* Mango drink: 16 liters * (1/9) = 16/9 ≈ 1.78 liters of water
* Apple drink: 14 liters * (1/2) = 7 liters of water
* Total water: 1.78 + 7 = 8.78 liters

**Percentage of water in the final mix:**

* Total mix: 30 liters
* Water content: 8.78 liters
* Percentage of water: (8.78 / 30) × 100% ≈ 29.27%

So, approximately 29.27% of the final mix is water.",29.27,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the mango drink. Since it's one-ninth water, we can find the amount of water by multiplying the total amount of mango drink by 1/9.

The mango drink is 16 liters, so the amount of water in it is 16 * (1/9) = 16/9 = 1.78 liters (approximately).

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the apple drink. Since it's one-half water, we can find the amount of water by multiplying the total amount of apple drink by 1/2.

The apple drink is 14 liters, so the amount of water in it is 14 * (1/2) = 7 liters.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water in the mix after spilling 7 liters of the mango drink and adding 7 liters of water. The amount of water from the mango drink that remains is 1.78 - 7/9 = 1.78 - 0.78 = 1 liter (approximately).

The total amount of water in the mix is the sum of the water from the mango drink and the apple drink, which is 1 + 7 = 8 liters.

The total amount of the mix is the sum of the mango drink and the apple drink, minus the 7 liters that were spilled, plus the 7 liters of water that were added. This is 16 - 7 + 7 = 16 liters.

To find the percentage of water in the final mix, we can divide the total amount of water by the total amount of the mix and multiply by 100.

The percentage of water in the final mix is (8/16) * 100 = 50%.

The answer is 50%.",50.0,1,,50.0,1
gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct,"Mei can run four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is 1/2 as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 10 hours if she spends 2/5 of the time running, 1/2 of the time skipping, and the remaining of the time walking?",27.0,"## Step 1: Determine Mei's running speed
Mei can skip at a rate of speed that is 1/2 as fast as she can run. Since she can skip at 2 miles per hour, her running speed is 2 * 2 = 4 miles per hour.

## Step 2: Calculate Mei's walking speed
Mei can run four times faster than she can walk. If her running speed is 4 miles per hour, then her walking speed is 4 / 4 = 1 mile per hour.

## Step 3: Calculate the time spent running
Mei spends 2/5 of the time running. If the total time is 10 hours, then the time spent running is 2/5 * 10 = 4 hours.

## Step 4: Calculate the time spent skipping
Mei spends 1/2 of the time skipping. If the total time is 10 hours, then the time spent skipping is 1/2 * 10 = 5 hours.

## Step 5: Calculate the time spent walking
The remaining time is spent walking. Since Mei spends 4 hours running and 5 hours skipping, the time spent walking is 10 - 4 - 5 = 1 hour.

## Step 6: Calculate the distance traveled running
Mei runs at 4 miles per hour for 4 hours. The distance traveled running is 4 * 4 = 16 miles.

## Step 7: Calculate the distance traveled skipping
Mei skips at 2 miles per hour for 5 hours. The distance traveled skipping is 2 * 5 = 10 miles.

## Step 8: Calculate the distance traveled walking
Mei walks at 1 mile per hour for 1 hour. The distance traveled walking is 1 * 1 = 1 mile.

## Step 9: Calculate the total distance traveled
The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances traveled running, skipping, and walking. The total distance is 16 + 10 + 1 = 27 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$",27.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Mei can skip at 2 miles per hour. Since she can skip at 1/2 as fast as she can run, her running speed is 2 * 2 = 4 miles per hour.

We are given that she spends 2/5 of the time running. So, the time spent running is 2/5 * 10 = 4 hours.

She also spends 1/2 of the time skipping, which is 1/2 * 10 = 5 hours.

The remaining time is spent walking. Since she spends 4 hours running and 5 hours skipping, the time spent walking is 10 - 4 - 5 = 1 hour.

Since her running speed is 4 miles per hour and she spends 4 hours running, the distance covered while running is 4 * 4 = 16 miles.

Since her skipping speed is 2 miles per hour and she spends 5 hours skipping, the distance covered while skipping is 2 * 5 = 10 miles.

Finally, she spends 1 hour walking. Since there is no information given about her walking speed, let's assume her walking speed is x miles per hour. So, the distance covered while walking is x * 1 = x miles.

The total distance covered is the sum of the distances covered while running, skipping, and walking: 16 + 10 + x = 26 + x miles.

The answer is 26 + x miles.",26.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Mei can skip at 2 miles per hour.

Since she can run 2 times as fast as she can skip, she can run at 2 * 2 = 4 miles per hour.

She can walk at 1/2 as fast as she can run, so she can walk at 4 / 2 = 2 miles per hour.

Mei spends 2/5 of the time running. So, the time spent running is (2/5) * 10 = 4 hours.

She spends 1/2 of the time skipping. So, the time spent skipping is (1/2) * 10 = 5 hours.

The remaining time is spent walking. So, the time spent walking is 10 - 4 - 5 = 1 hour.

Now, let's calculate the total distance covered in each mode of transportation:

- Time spent running: 4 hours, speed: 4 miles per hour
Total distance covered while running: 4 * 4 = 16 miles

- Time spent skipping: 5 hours, speed: 2 miles per hour
Total distance covered while skipping: 5 * 2 = 10 miles

- Time spent walking: 1 hour, speed: 2 miles per hour
Total distance covered while walking: 1 * 2 = 2 miles

The total distance covered is 16 + 10 + 2 = 28 miles.

If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?",180.0,"To find out how many calories you can consume, we need to determine how many calories you have left for the day. 

First, let's calculate your total daily calorie target with the calories burned during exercise:
Total daily target calories = 2300
Calories burned during exercise = 100
Total calories to burn = 2300 - 100 = 2200

Since you've already consumed 1200 calories, subtract this from your total calories to burn:
Remaining calories for the day = 2200 - 1200 = 1000 calories

Each serving of cookies has 200 calories. There are 5 servings in the bag. To find out how many calories are in the entire bag:
Total calories in the bag = 5 servings * 200 calories/serving = 1000 calories

Since you can only consume 1000 calories, the amount of cookies you can eat is equivalent to 1 serving:
Amount of cookies you can eat = 1000 calories / 200 calories/serving = 5 servings

The total weight of the bag is 150 oz, and there are 5 servings in the bag. To find out the weight of 1 serving, divide the total weight by the number of servings:
Weight of 1 serving = 150 oz / 5 servings = 30 oz

Q: According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has 200 calories per serving. If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's determine how many calories are left in the daily calorie target.
The daily calorie target is 2300.
You have already consumed 1200 calories.
You have also exercised for 100 calories, which is a negative calorie intake.
So, the total calories consumed is 1200 - 100 = 1100.
The calories left in the daily calorie target is 2300 - 1100 = 1200.

Next, let's determine how many calories are in the bag of cookies.
The bag has 5 servings.
Each serving has 200 calories.
So, the total calories in the bag is 5 * 200 = 1000.

Now, let's determine how many oz can be eaten.
The bag has 150 oz.
The calories left in the daily calorie target is 1200.
Each serving has 200 calories.
So, the number of servings that can be eaten is 1200 / 200 = 6.
Since there are 5 servings in the bag, you can eat all 5 servings.

To find the number of oz that can be eaten, we need to find the fraction of the bag that can be eaten.
The fraction of the bag that can be eaten is 5/5 = 1.
Since the bag has 150 oz, the number of oz that can be eaten is 150 * 1 = 150.

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider that the question asks for the number of oz that can be eaten, not the total number of oz in the bag.

Let's re-evaluate the problem.
We know that the bag has 5 servings and each serving has 200 calories.
We also know that the calories left in the daily calorie target is 1200.
Since each serving has 200 calories, we can divide the calories left in the daily calorie target by the calories per serving to find the number of servings that can be eaten.
The number of servings that can be eaten is 1200 / 200 = 6.
However, this is not possible since there are only 5 servings in the bag.

Let's re-evaluate the problem again.
We know that the bag has 5 servings and each serving has 200 calories.
We also know that the calories left in the daily calorie target is 1200.
Since each serving has 200 calories, we can divide the calories left in the daily calorie target by the calories per serving to find the number of servings that can be eaten.

Q: According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has 200 calories per serving. If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total calories in the bag of cookies.
The bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 200 calories.
So, the total calories in the bag are 5 * 200 = 1000 calories.

You have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories, so you have a remaining calorie target of 2300 - 1200 - 100 = 1000 calories.

Since the bag of cookies has 1000 calories, you can eat the entire bag to meet your remaining calorie target.

However, the question asks how many oz you can eat, not how many calories. Since the bag is 150 oz, you can eat the entire bag, which is 150 oz.

How many potted plants will Kayla remain with?",703.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of potted plants Kayla already has on her window ledges**

She has 12 potted plants on each of the 65 window ledges, so:

12 potted plants/ledge × 65 ledges = 780 potted plants

**Step 2: Add the new potted plants she received last week**

She received 43 new potted plants:

780 potted plants (already had) + 43 potted plants (new) = 823 potted plants

**Step 3: Add the new potted plants she purchased yesterday**

She purchased 140 new plants at a 50% discount, which means she got 50% off the original price. To find the number of plants she actually got, we need to calculate 50% of 140:

50% of 140 = 0.5 × 140 = 70

So, she got 70 new plants:

823 potted plants + 70 potted plants = 893 potted plants

**Step 4: Calculate the number of potted plants she will give away**

She will give 4 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family, and she has 65 ledges:

4 potted plants/ledge × 65 ledges = 260 potted plants

**Step 5: Subtract the number of potted plants she will give away from the total number of potted plants she has**

How many potted plants will Kayla remain with?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Kayla already has on her window ledges.
She has 12 potted plants on each of the 65 window ledges.
So, the total number of potted plants on the ledges is 65 * 12 = 780.

Next, let's calculate the total number of new potted plants Kayla received and purchased.
She received 43 new potted plants last week.
She purchased 140 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount. Since it's a 50% discount, she actually paid for 140 / 2 = 70 plants.
So, the total number of new potted plants is 43 + 70 = 113.

She already had 780 potted plants on the ledges.
She received and purchased 113 new potted plants.
So, the total number of potted plants before giving any away is 780 + 113 = 893.

Finally, let's calculate the number of potted plants Kayla will give away.
She will give 4 potted plants from each of the 65 window ledges.
So, the total number of potted plants she will give away is 65 * 4 = 260.

To find the number of potted plants Kayla will remain with, we subtract the number of potted plants she will give away from the total number of potted plants before giving any away.

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many miles the fog bank covers in a given time.
It takes 41 minutes to cover 3 miles.
So, the speed at which the fog bank travels is 3 miles / 41 minutes.

Since we are asked to find the time it takes to cover 1/3 of the city, we need to find the distance 1/3 of the city.

Let's set up a proportion: 3 miles / 41 minutes = 6 miles / x minutes.
We can cross multiply and solve for x: 3x = 6 * 41, 3x = 246, x = 246 / 3, x = 82.

Let's start by calculating the total time Noah watched TV from Saturday to Thursday:

- Saturday and Sunday: 2 days * 4 hours = 8 hours
- Monday: we don't know the time yet
- Tuesday: 1 3-hour episode + 0.75 (45 minutes) hour = 3.75 hours
- Wednesday: 2 * 5 hours = 10 hours
- Thursday: 4 * 0.25 (15 minutes) hour = 1 hour

Now, let's add up the time we know:

Since Noah watched 24 hours of TV in total, we need to find out how much time is left for Monday:
24 - 22.75 = 1.25 hours

Since we are looking for 15-minute episodes on Monday, we'll convert 1.25 hours into minutes: 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Now, let's divide the time spent on Monday by the length of each 15-minute episode (15 minutes) to find the number of episodes:
75 / 15 = 5 episodes.

First, we need to find the total number of 15-minute episodes Noah watched in 24 hours.

We know that 1 hour equals 60 minutes. 
So, 24 hours is equal to 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes.

Since we need to find out how many 15-minute episodes he watched, we divide the total minutes watched (1440) by 15.

1 episode of 15 minutes is 15 minutes. 
So, the total number of 15-minute episodes is 1440 / 15 = 96 episodes.

However, we need to consider the different types of episodes he watched on each day:
On Monday, he watched a 15-minute show and two other episodes are not mentioned, so they must be 15 minutes long. 
On Tuesday, he watched a 3-hour episode (180 minutes) and a 45-minute show. 
On Wednesday, he watched two 5-hour episodes (2 * 300 = 600 minutes).
On Thursday, he watched four episodes of 15 minutes.

The total number of minutes for Monday is 15 * 4 = 60 (we know there are 4 episodes of 15 minutes on Monday).
The total number of minutes for Tuesday is 180 + 45 = 225.
The total number of minutes for Wednesday is 600.
The total number of minutes for Thursday is 15 * 4 = 60.

Now, let's find the total minutes watched on days other than Monday: 225 + 600 + 60 = 885 minutes.

If he watched 24 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours Noah watched TV on Saturday and Sunday.
He watched 4-hour episodes each night, so he watched 4 + 4 = 8 hours on Saturday and Sunday.

Next, let's calculate the total number of hours Noah watched TV on Tuesday.
He watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. We need to convert the 45-minute show to hours: 45 minutes / 60 = 0.75 hours.
So, the total number of hours Noah watched TV on Tuesday is 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total number of hours Noah watched TV on Wednesday.
He watched two 5-hour episodes, so he watched 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total number of hours Noah watched TV on Thursday.
He watched four episodes, each 15 minutes. We need to convert the 15-minute episodes to hours: 15 minutes / 60 = 0.25 hours.
So, the total number of hours Noah watched TV on Thursday is 4 * 0.25 = 1 hour.

Now, let's add up the total number of hours Noah watched TV on each day:
8 hours (Saturday and Sunday) + 3.75 hours (Tuesday) + 10 hours (Wednesday) + 1 hour (Thursday) = 22.75 hours.

However, we know that Noah watched 24 hours of TV in all. This means that the remaining hours were watched on Monday.
So, the number of hours Noah watched TV on Monday is 24 - 22.75 = 1.25 hours.

Since we want to find the number of 15-minute episodes Noah watched on Monday, we need to convert the 1.25 hours to minutes: 1.25 hours * 60 = 75 minutes.

If she used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.",504.0,"To find out how many teaspoonfuls of sugar Fatima used, we need to first determine the total number of cups of water she used and the total number of tablespoons of milk she used, and then calculate their ratio in terms of the given ratio of sugar to water and milk to water.

Let's start by considering the ratio of sugar to water. The given ratio is 63:14.

Let's assume the common ratio is 'x'. Then, the number of cups of water would be 14x and the number of teaspoons of sugar would be 63x.

The total number of teaspoons of sugar Fatima used is 760. We can write the equation as:
63x = 760

To solve for 'x', we'll divide both sides of the equation by 63.
x = 760 / 63
x = 12.06 (approximately)

Now that we know 'x', we can calculate the number of cups of water and tablespoons of milk used. The number of cups of water = 14x
Number of cups of water = 14 * 12.06
Number of cups of water = 168.84 (approximately)

Since Fatima also uses 9 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water, we can find the number of tablespoons of milk by first finding the number of sets of 7 cups of water.
Number of sets of 7 cups of water = 168.84 / 7
Number of sets of 7 cups of water = 24.12 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll round it down to 24 sets of 7 cups of water. Now we know she used 24 sets of 7 cups of water, so the number of tablespoons of milk used would be 9 * 24.
Number of tablespoons of milk used = 9 * 24
Number of tablespoons of milk used = 216

Now, we know that the total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk used is 760. We also know the number of cups of water and tablespoons of milk used.
Let's denote the number of cups of water as 168.84 (approximately) and the number of tablespoons of milk as 216. The number of teaspoons of sugar is given as 760. 

Since the total is 760 and we know the water and milk used, we can write the equation as:
168.84 + 216 + 63x = 760

To find 'x', we'll combine the constants on one side of the equation. 
63x = 760 - 384.84 (approximately)
63x = 375.16 (approximately)

Now we'll divide both sides of the equation by 63 to find the value of x.
x = 375.16 / 63
x = 5.96 (approximately)

Now that we know 'x', we can calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar used.
Number of teaspoons of sugar = 63x
Number of teaspoons of sugar = 63 * 5.96
Number of teaspoons of sugar = 375.48 (approximately)

So Fatima used approximately 375.48 teaspoons of sugar.",375.48,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Let's think step by step.
The ratio of sugar to water is 63:14.
This means that for every 63 teaspoons of sugar, Fatima uses 14 cups of water.
The ratio of water to milk is 7:9.
This means that for every 7 cups of water, Fatima uses 9 tablespoons of milk.
We can simplify the ratio of sugar to milk by multiplying the two ratios together:
(63:14) × (7:9) = (63 × 7 : 14 × 9) = (441 : 126)
This means that for every 441 teaspoons of sugar, Fatima uses 126 tablespoons of milk.
We are given that Fatima used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk.
Let's represent the number of cups of water as x.
Then, the number of tablespoons of milk is (126/441) × x.
The total amount of sugar, water, and milk is 760.
We can set up the equation:
63x + 14x + (126/441) × x = 760
Combine like terms:
(63 + 14 + 126/441) × x = 760
Simplify the fraction:
(77 + 126/441) × x = 760
Multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction by 441:
(77 + 126/441) × x = 760
(77 + 0.286) × x = 760
(77.286) × x = 760
Divide both sides by 77.286:
x = 760 / 77.286
x ≈ 9.84
Now that we have the number of cups of water, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar:
63x ≈ 63 × 9.84
≈ 621.12
Since we can't have a fraction of a teaspoon, we'll round down to the nearest whole number:
The answer is 621.",621.0,0,"Here's the corrected solution:

Q: Fatima makes coffee using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 63:14. She also uses 9 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water. If she used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's express the ratio of sugar to water as a fraction: 63/14.

Next, let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 63 and 14. The LCM is 126.

Now, let's express the ratio of sugar to water in terms of the LCM: 63/14 = 9/2.

This means that for every 2 cups of water, Fatima uses 9 teaspoons of sugar.

We are also given that Fatima uses 9 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water. Let's express this ratio as a fraction: 9/7.

Now, let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 7. The LCM is 63.

This means that for every 63 cups of water, Fatima uses 9 tablespoons of milk.

Since we know that Fatima used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, let's assume that the total number of cups of water is x.

Then, the total number of teaspoons of sugar is 9/2 * x.

We are also given that the total number of tablespoons of milk is 9/7 * x.

Since the total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk is 760, we can set up the equation:

9/2 * x + x + 9/7 * x = 760

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 14 (the LCM of 2, 7, and 14):

63 * x + 14 * x + 18 * x = 10640

Combine like terms:

95 * x = 10640

Divide both sides by 95:

x = 112

Now that we know the total number of cups of water, we can find the total number of teaspoons of sugar:

Total number of teaspoons of sugar = 9/2 * x
= 9/2 * 112

2. The guests brought 3 packs of spoons, each having 13 inside them, so the total number of spoons they brought is 3 * 13 = 39.
3. Rania used 11 spoons while making the shrimp scampi. 
4. Let's assume the number of spoons in the package that Rania bought is 'x'.
5. The total number of spoons Rania had after receiving them from her husband and the guests is 86.

Now, let's write an equation based on this information. The total number of spoons is the sum of the spoons Rania's husband brought, the spoons the guests brought, and the spoons Rania bought, minus the spoons she used.

Total spoons = (spoons from husband) + (spoons from guests) + (spoons Rania bought) - (spoons used)
86 = 17 + 39 + x - 11

Combine the constants:
86 = 45 + x

Now, subtract 45 from both sides:
86 - 45 = x
x = 41

So, the number of spoons in the package that Rania bought is 41.",41.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Rania starts with an unknown number of spoons (let's call it x) from the package she bought.

Her husband gives her 17 more spoons.

She uses 11 spoons while making the shrimp scampi.

The guests bring 3 packs of spoons, each with 13 spoons, so they bring a total of 3 * 13 = 39 spoons.

Later, Rania has a total of 86 spoons.

So, the total number of spoons Rania has is the sum of the initial spoons, the spoons her husband gave her, the spoons she used, and the spoons the guests brought: x + 17 - 11 + 39.

This expression equals 86, the total number of spoons Rania has. 

So, we have the equation: x + 17 - 11 + 39 = 86.

Combine the constants: 17 - 11 + 39 = 45.

Now the equation is: x + 45 = 86.

Subtract 45 from both sides: x = 41.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row?,43.75,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 and the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row, and then find the difference between the two probabilities.

**Probability of rolling a number greater than 10:**

There are 10 numbers greater than 10 on a 20-sided die (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20). So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is:

10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5

**Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row:**

The probability of rolling an odd number on a 20-sided die is 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5, since there are 10 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19) out of 20.

To find the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row, we need to multiply the probability of rolling an odd number four times:

(1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/16 = 0.0625

**Difference between the two probabilities:**

Now, we need to find the difference between the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 and the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row:

0.5 - 0.0625 = 0.4375

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.4375 × 100 = 43.75%

So, Luis is 43.75% more likely to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll four odd numbers in a row.",10.0,0,"However, I need to point out that the question you provided involves a complex probability problem that cannot be solved with a straightforward step-by-step process like the previous examples. The question is more suitable for a detailed explanation of probability concepts.

But I'll try to guide you through the problem step by step as much as possible. However, the answer will be provided in a separate section due to the complexity of the problem.

Let's think step by step.

Luis is rolling a 20-sided die, which means there are 20 equally likely outcomes.

For the first part of the question, we need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 10. The numbers greater than 10 on a 20-sided die are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20, which is a total of 10 numbers.

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is 10/20 = 0.5 or 50%.

For the second part of the question, we need to find the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row. The odd numbers on a 20-sided die are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19, which is a total of 10 numbers.

Since the die roll is independent, we can find the probability of each roll being odd and then multiply the probabilities together. 

The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is 10/20 = 0.5.

Since Luis needs to roll four odd numbers in a row, we need to multiply the probability together four times: (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.0625 or 6.25%.

Now, to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll four odd numbers in a row, we need to subtract the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 10.

So, 50% - 6.25% = 43.75%.

However, the question asks for the answer as a percentage. To convert the decimal to a percentage, we don't need to do anything, since 43.75% is already a percentage.

The answer is 43.75%.

Note that this is an approximation of the actual probability, as the actual probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row is slightly less than 6.25% due to the possibility of some rolls being even and breaking the sequence.",6.25,0,"I'll apply the same format to the problem of Isabella deciding whether to do her taxes herself or hire a financial advisor.

Yuki was originally pen pals with 8 people but stopped with 4, so he has 4 pen pals left.

Since Yuki responds in kind, he also sends 3 x 52 = 156 letters a year to each of the 4 pen pals. 

There are 4 pen pals, so he sends a total of 156 * 4 = 624 letters a year.

A: Let's think step by step.

Yuki starts with 8 penpals.
He stops being penpals with 4 of them.
So, he has 8 - 4 = 4 penpals left.

Each penpal sends 3 letters a week, and each letter is 10 pages long.
So, each penpal sends 3 * 10 = 30 pages a week.
Since there are 4 penpals, the total number of pages sent is 4 * 30 = 120 pages a week.

Yuki responds to each letter, so he also sends 120 pages a week.

Since Yuki can write a page every 14 minutes, the total number of minutes he spends writing a week is 120 * 14 = 1680 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total number of hours Yuki spends writing a week is 1680 / 60 = 28 hours.

2. Ms. Johnson can get a 10% discount on the selling price, so the discounted price is:
   $500,000 - (10% of $500,000) = $500,000 - $50,000 = $450,000
3. The brokerage fee is 4% of the selling price, which is:
   4% of $500,000 = 0.04 x $500,000 = $20,000
4. The transfer fee is 13% of the selling price, which is:
   13% of $500,000 = 0.13 x $500,000 = $65,000
5. The total cost of the property will be the discounted price plus the brokerage fee and the transfer fee:
   $450,000 + $20,000 + $65,000 = $535,000
6. The difference between the total cost and Ms. Johnson's budget is:
   $535,000 - $470,000 = $65,000

The selling price of the property is $500,000.

Ms. Johnson gets a 10% discount on the selling price.
So, the discounted price is 500,000 - (10% of 500,000) = 500,000 - 50,000 = 450,000.

The brokerage fee is 4% of the selling price.
So, the brokerage fee is 4% of 500,000 = 0.04 * 500,000 = 20,000.

The transfer fee is 13% of the selling price.
So, the transfer fee is 13% of 500,000 = 0.13 * 500,000 = 65,000.

The total cost is the sum of the discounted price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee.
So, the total cost is 450,000 + 20,000 + 65,000 = 535,000.

Ms. Johnson's budget is $470,000.
The total cost is $535,000.

**Step 1: Calculate Mateo's weekly income**

Mateo works 6 hours a day, 3 days a week, so his weekly hours are:
6 hours/day × 3 days/week = 18 hours/week

He earns ₣25 per hour, so his weekly income is:
18 hours/week × ₣25/hour = ₣450/week

**Step 2: Calculate Mateo's monthly income**

Since there are 4 weeks in September, Mateo's monthly income is:
₣450/week × 4 weeks = ₣1800

**Step 3: Add the weekly bonus**

The company performed well for the whole month, so Mateo gets a ₣205 bonus each week. For 4 weeks, the total bonus is:

Therefore, Mateo made ₣1703 after tax in September.",1703.0,1,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Mateo works a 6-hour shift each day, 3 days a week. So, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week:

He works 6 hours a day.
There are 3 days in a week.
So, the total hours worked in a week is 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

Since Mateo works for the whole month, let's calculate the total hours worked in September:

There are 4 weeks in September.
He works 18 hours a week.
So, the total hours worked in September is 18 * 4 = 72 hours.

Mateo earns ₣25 per hour. Let's calculate his total earnings before tax:

He earns ₣25 per hour.
He worked 72 hours in September.
So, his total earnings before tax is 72 * 25 = ₣1800.

Mateo also gets a ₣205 bonus each week if the company performs well. Let's calculate his total bonus for the month:

He gets a ₣205 bonus each week.
There are 4 weeks in September.
So, his total bonus for the month is 205 * 4 = ₣820.

Now, let's calculate Mateo's total earnings before tax:

His total earnings before tax is ₣1800.
His total bonus for the month is ₣820.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial value of Ananya's shares**

Ananya buys 12 shares of a stock for ¥80 each. The initial value of her shares is:

12 shares × ¥80/share = ¥960

**Step 2: Calculate the stock price after the first year (55% increase)**

The stock price increases by 55% in the first year. To calculate the new stock price, we need to find 55% of the initial stock price and add it to the initial stock price.

Initial stock price = ¥80
Increase in stock price = 55% of ¥80 = 0.55 × ¥80 = ¥44
New stock price = ¥80 + ¥44 = ¥124

**Step 3: Calculate the stock price after the second year (25% decrease)**

The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. To calculate the new stock price, we need to find 25% of the stock price after the first year and subtract it from the stock price after the first year.

Stock price after first year = ¥124
Decrease in stock price = 25% of ¥124 = 0.25 × ¥124 = ¥31
New stock price = ¥124 - ¥31 = ¥93

A: Let's think step by step.

Ananya buys 12 shares of a stock for ¥80 each.
So, the initial cost is 12 * 80 = ¥960.

The stock price increases 55% in the first year.
The new price is 80 + (80 * 0.55) = 80 + 44 = ¥124.

The new price is 124 - (124 * 0.25) = 124 - 31 = ¥93.

Ananya now has 12 shares worth ¥93 each.

1. Emma wants to play one round of laser tag, so the cost for laser tag is:
€6 (cost per round) x 1 (number of rounds) = €6

2. Emma wants to have €4 in pinball tokens, so the cost for pinball tokens is:
€4 (cost of tokens)

3. Emma wants to ride the roller coaster three times, so the cost for the roller coaster is:

4. The total cost for Emma's activities (laser tag, pinball tokens, and roller coaster) is:

5. Emma also needs to rent a bus for the day, which costs €60.

6. The total budget for the birthday party is €180.

7. To find out how many friends Emma can invite, we need to subtract the total cost of the activities and the bus rental from the total budget:
€180 (total budget) - €40 (activities) - €60 (bus rental) = €80

8. Since Emma already knows the cost of laser tag per round, we can assume that the cost of laser tag for her and her friends will be the same. Let's assume the number of friends Emma can invite is x. Then, the total cost for laser tag for Emma and her friends will be:
€6 (cost per round) x (1 + x) (number of rounds for Emma and her friends) = €6 + €6x

9. The total cost for the birthday party is the sum of the cost for Emma's activities, the cost for her friends' activities, and the bus rental:
€6 + €6x + €40 (activities) + €60 (bus rental) = €106 + €6x

10. Since the total budget for the birthday party is €180, we can set up the equation:
€106 + €6x = €180

11. To solve for x, we need to isolate x:
€6x = €180 - €106
€6x = €74

12. Now, we can divide both sides by €6 to solve for x:
x = €74 / €6
x = 12.33

Emma has a budget of €180 for her birthday party.

First, we need to subtract the cost of renting the bus for the day, which is €60.
Emma starts with €180.
She needs to rent a bus for €60.
So, she has €180 - €60 = €120 left.

Next, we need to find out the total cost of the activities for Emma and her friends.
A round of laser tag costs €6.
Emma and her friends will each play one round, so the cost for laser tag is 2 * €6 = €12.
The roller coaster costs €10 per ride, and they will ride it 3 times, so the cost for the roller coaster is 3 * €10 = €30.
In addition, they each get €4 in pinball tokens, so the cost for the pinball tokens is 2 * €4 = €8.
The total cost for the activities is €12 + €30 + €8 = €50.

We need to subtract this total cost from Emma's remaining budget.
Emma has €120 left after renting the bus.
The total cost for the activities is €50.
So, she has €120 - €50 = €70 left for inviting her friends.

Since Emma and she herself will also be playing the laser tag and using the pinball tokens, the remaining money is for her friends, so we need to divide the remaining money by 2.

A: Let's think step by step.

Emma has a budget of €180 for the party.
She wants to play one round of laser tag for herself and each friend, which costs €6 per person. 
So, the cost of laser tag is 2 * 6 = €12.

She wants to have €4 in pinball tokens.
The cost of pinball tokens is €4.

She wants to ride the roller coaster three times for each friend, at €10 per ride.
So, the cost of roller coaster rides is 2 * 10 * 3 = €60.

The bus rental costs €60.

The total cost for the party is 12 + 4 + 60 + 60 = €136.

Emma has €180 and the cost of the party is €136.
So, the remaining money for her friends is 180 - 136 = €44.

The cost for each friend is 6 for laser tag + 4 for pinball tokens = €10.

The number of friends she can invite is the remaining money divided by the cost per friend.

So, Jamal slew 270 giants.

3. Luis slew four times as many giants as Jamal. To find out how many giants Luis slew, we need to multiply the number of giants Jamal slew by 4.

We know the area is 225 square feet and the length is 16 feet longer than the width.

Let's call the width 'x'. Since the length is 16 feet longer than the width, the length is x + 16.

We know the area of a rectangle is length * width, so we can set up an equation:

Area = length * width
225 = (x + 16) * x

Now we need to solve for x.

Expanding the equation:
225 = x^2 + 16x

Rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:
x^2 + 16x - 225 = 0

We can factor the quadratic equation:
(x + 25)(x - 9) = 0

This gives us two possible values for x:
x = -25 (not possible, since width can't be negative)
x = 9

Since the width is 9 feet, the length is x + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25 feet.

Now that we have the width and length, we can find the perimeter of the room:

The area of the room is 225 square feet.
The formula for the area of a rectangle is length * width.
Let's call the width ""w"" and the length ""l"".
We know that l = w + 16 (since the length is 16 feet longer than the width).
We can write the area equation as: w * (w + 16) = 225.

Now, let's expand the equation: w^2 + 16w = 225.

Next, let's rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation: w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0.

To solve for w, we can use the quadratic formula: w = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 1, b = 16, and c = -225.

Plugging in the values, we get: w = (-16 ± √(16^2 - 4(1)(-225))) / 2(1).

Simplifying the equation, we get: w = (-16 ± √(256 + 900)) / 2.

w = (-16 ± √1156) / 2.

w = (-16 ± 34) / 2.

We have two possible values for w: w = (-16 + 34) / 2 or w = (-16 - 34) / 2.

w = 18 / 2 or w = -50 / 2.

w = 9 or w = -25.

Since the width cannot be negative, we take w = 9.

Now that we have the width, we can find the length: l = w + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25.

What percentage of all the puppies have spots?",80.0,"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to find the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

**Step 1: Find the total number of puppies**

Olivia's dog has 148 puppies.
Gabriel's dog has 62 puppies.
Santiago has 62 dogs, each having 10 puppies with spots, so he has 62 x 10 = 620 puppies.

Total number of puppies = 148 + 62 + 620 = 830

**Step 2: Find the total number of puppies with spots**

Olivia's dog has 28 puppies with spots.
Gabriel's dog has 16 puppies with spots.
Santiago has 620 puppies, 10 of which have spots, so he has 620 x 10 = 6200 puppies with spots.

Total number of puppies with spots = 28 + 16 + 6200 = 6244

**Step 3: Find the percentage of puppies with spots**

To find the percentage, divide the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies, and multiply by 100.

First, let's find the total number of puppies.
Olivia's dog has 148 puppies.
Gabriel's dog has 62 puppies.
Santiago has 62 dogs, each having 10 puppies with spots, but we are not considering these puppies in the total count, only the ones with spots.
So, the total number of puppies is 148 + 62 = 210.

Next, let's find the total number of puppies with spots.
Olivia's dog has 28 puppies with spots.
Gabriel's dog has 16 puppies with spots.
Santiago has 62 dogs, each having 10 puppies with spots.
So, the total number of puppies with spots is 28 + 16 + 62 * 10 = 28 + 16 + 620 = 664.

Now, let's calculate the percentage of puppies with spots.
The total number of puppies is 210.
The total number of puppies with spots is 664.
So, the percentage of puppies with spots is (664 / 210) * 100 = 316.19%.

However, since the percentage cannot be more than 100%, we need to recalculate the total number of puppies with spots considering only Olivia's and Gabriel's dogs.
Olivia's dog has 148 puppies.
Gabriel's dog has 62 puppies.
So, the total number of puppies is 148 + 62 = 210.
Olivia's dog has 28 puppies with spots.
Gabriel's dog has 16 puppies with spots.
So, the total number of puppies with spots is 28 + 16 = 44.

Now, let's calculate the percentage of puppies with spots.
The total number of puppies is 210.

How many trips does the farmer need to transport all the items, if he has three trucks?",5.0,"To find the total number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the items, we need to calculate the total weight of all the items and divide it by the capacity of the farm truck.

First, let's calculate the total weight of each item:

* Corns: 4 boxes x 5 kg/box = 20 kg
* Carrots: 11 bags x 9 kg/bag = 99 kg
* Apples: 33 packs x 43 kg/pack = 1419 kg

The farmer buys:
- 4 boxes of corns, each 5 kg, so the total weight of corns is 4 * 5 = 20 kg.

- 33 packs of apples, each 43 kg, so the total weight of apples is 33 * 43 = 1413 kg.
- 18 sacks of wheat, each 19 kg, so the total weight of wheat is 18 * 19 = 342 kg.
- 43 kg of grocery.

1. Sanjay has 10 tubes of pink paint and 3 tubes of blue paint.

2. Yuki has 2/4 as many tubes of pink paint as Sanjay. To find 2/4 of 10, we multiply 10 by 2 and divide by 4:
   10 × 2 = 20
   20 ÷ 4 = 5

When the water is warm, Carlos swims a kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times as long. How much longer does Carlos take to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day than 9 kilometers on a cold day?",272.0,"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Carlos to swim 1 kilometer on a warm day, and then how long it takes him to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day and 9 kilometers on a cold day.

**Step 1: Find out how long it takes Carlos to swim 1 kilometer on a warm day**

When the water is warm, Carlos swims a kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times as long as it takes him to swim a kilometer on a cold day. Since it takes him 11 minutes to swim a kilometer on a cold day, we multiply 11 by 4 and add 9:

4 × 11 = 44
44 + 9 = 53

So, it takes Carlos 53 minutes to swim a kilometer on a warm day.

**Step 2: Find out how long it takes Carlos to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day**

Since it takes Carlos 53 minutes to swim 1 kilometer on a warm day, we multiply 53 by 7:

53 × 7 = 371

So, it takes Carlos 371 minutes to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day.

**Step 3: Find out how long it takes Carlos to swim 9 kilometers on a cold day**

Since it takes Carlos 11 minutes to swim 1 kilometer on a cold day, we multiply 11 by 9:

11 × 9 = 99

So, it takes Carlos 99 minutes to swim 9 kilometers on a cold day.

**Step 4: Find out how much longer it takes Carlos to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day than 9 kilometers on a cold day**

We subtract the time it takes Carlos to swim 9 kilometers on a cold day from the time it takes him to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day:

371 - 99 = 272

So, it takes Carlos 272 minutes longer to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day than 9 kilometers on a cold day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{272}$",272.0,1,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Carlos swims a kilometer in 11 minutes when the water is cold.

When the water is warm, Carlos swims a kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times as long as when the water is cold. 

First, let's find out how long it takes Carlos to swim a kilometer in warm water. 
Four times as long as when the water is cold is 4 * 11 = 44 minutes.
9 minutes more than that is 44 + 9 = 53 minutes.

So, it takes Carlos 53 minutes to swim a kilometer in warm water.

Now, let's find out how long it takes Carlos to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day. 
Since it takes him 53 minutes to swim 1 kilometer, it will take him 7 * 53 = 371 minutes to swim 7 kilometers.

Next, let's find out how long it takes Carlos to swim 9 kilometers on a cold day. 
Since it takes him 11 minutes to swim 1 kilometer, it will take him 9 * 11 = 99 minutes to swim 9 kilometers.

Now, let's find out how much longer Carlos takes to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day than 9 kilometers on a cold day.

Let's start by finding the daily production for Emma, Nadia, and Uma.

Emma processes 8 customers per day.

Since Nadia operates the cash register exactly nine times as fast as Emma, Nadia's daily production is 9 times Emma's daily production:
Nadia's daily production = 9 × 8 = 72 customers

Since Uma operates at the same speed as the average of Emma and Nadia, we need to find the average of Emma's and Nadia's daily production:
Average daily production = (Emma's daily production + Nadia's daily production) / 2

Now, Uma's daily production is the same as the average daily production:
Uma's daily production = 40 customers

1. Calculate the cost of the normal brand of flour for a week:
   Normal brand flour per kilogram: ₣10
   Santiago uses 3 kilograms per day, and there are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of flour for a week is 3 * 7 = 21 kilograms.
   Total cost of normal brand flour for a week: 21 * ₣10 = ₣210.

Step 1: Determine how many kilograms of flour Santiago needs for a week.
He uses 3 kilograms of flour per day.
There are 7 days in a week.
So, the total number of kilograms needed is 3 * 7 = 21.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the regular brand flour for a week.
The normal brand of flour costs ₣10 per kilogram.
Santiago needs 21 kilograms.
So, the total cost for the normal brand is 21 * ₣10 = ₣210.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of flour since his favorite brand is sold out.

Each small cube uses 1/4 of a gram, and he makes 24 small cubes. 
First, we need to convert 1/4 of a gram to decimal form, since it's easier to work with decimal numbers.

How many like to paint if the number that like to read is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing hurling?",99.0,"To find the number of students who like to paint, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Find the number of students who like to read.
2. Find the number of students who like to paint.

Step 1: Find the number of students who like to read.

Let's denote the number of students who like to play hurling as H. We are given that H = 6.

We are also given that the number of students who like to read is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing hurling. So, the number of students who like to read is 4H - 3.

Substituting H = 6 into the equation, we get:

Number of students who like to read = 4(6) - 3
= 24 - 3
= 21

Step 2: Find the number of students who like to paint.

We are given that the total number of students is 160. We also know that 34 like to bake, 6 like to play hurling, and 21 like to read.

So, the number of students who like to paint is the total number of students minus the number of students who like to bake, play hurling, and read.

Number of students who like to paint = Total number of students - (Number of students who like to bake + Number of students who like to play hurling + Number of students who like to read)
= 160 - (34 + 6 + 21)
= 160 - 61
= 99

Therefore, 99 students like to paint.",99.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The total number of students is 160.
34 students like to bake.
6 students like to play hurling.

The rest of the students like to either paint or read.
So, the number of students who like to paint or read is 160 - 34 - 6 = 120.

It's given that the number of students who like to read is 3 less than four times the number who like to play hurling.
Let's call the number of students who like to play hurling 'h'.
Then, the number of students who like to read is 4h - 3.

Since we know the number of students who like to play hurling is 6, we can write the equation:
4h - 3 = 120 - 34 - 6
4h - 3 = 80

Now, let's solve for h:
4h = 80 + 3
4h = 83
h = 83 / 4
h = 20.75

Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we'll assume that 20 students like to play hurling and some other activities.

Now, we can find the number of students who like to read:
Number of students who like to read = 4h - 3
= 4 * 20 - 3
= 80 - 3
= 77

The number of students who like to paint is the total number of students who like to paint or read minus the number who like to read:
Number of students who like to paint = 120 - 77
= 43

The answer is 43.",43.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

A group of 160 students has various hobbies. 
34 like to bake, 
6 like to play hurling, 
and the rest like to either paint or read.

Let's start by finding the total number of students who like to play hurling or paint. 
We know that 34 like to bake, and 6 like to play hurling. 
So, the number of students who like to play hurling or paint is 160 - (34 + 6) = 160 - 40 = 120.

We are also given that the number of students who like to read is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing hurling. 
Let's represent the number of students who like to play hurling as H. 
Then, the number of students who like to read is 4H - 3.

We know that the total number of students who like to play hurling or paint is 120. 
So, the number of students who like to paint is 120 - (H + (4H - 3)) = 120 - 5H + 3 = 123 - 5H.

We also know that the total number of students is 160. 
So, the number of students who like to paint or read is 160. 
We can set up the equation: H + (4H - 3) + (123 - 5H) = 160. 
Combine like terms: 0H + 123 - 3 = 160. 
Simplify: 120 = 160.

How much money is Yuki missing if he has ¥15 and the music festival costs ¥490?",181.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The youth club will cover a tenth of the cost of the music festival. To find out how much they will cover, we need to multiply the total cost by 1/10:

¥490 × 1/10 = ¥49

So, the youth club will cover ¥49.

2. Yuki's friends will cover 1/2 of the music festival. To find out how much they will cover, we need to multiply the total cost by 1/2:

¥490 × 1/2 = ¥245

So, Yuki's friends will cover ¥245.

3. Now, let's add up the amount covered by the youth club and Yuki's friends:

¥49 + ¥245 = ¥294

This means that a total of ¥294 will be covered by the youth club and Yuki's friends.

4. Yuki has ¥15, so we need to subtract the amount covered by the youth club and Yuki's friends from the total cost to find out how much money Yuki is missing:

¥490 - ¥294 = ¥196

However, we also need to subtract the ¥15 that Yuki has, since we don't want to count that as part of the money he is missing:

¥196 - ¥15 = ¥181

The total cost of the music festival is ¥490.

The youth club will cover a tenth of the cost, which is 1/10 of ¥490.

The youth club is covering ¥49.

Yuki's friends will cover a half of the cost, which is 1/2 of ¥490.
So, the amount covered by Yuki's friends is 490 * (1/2) = 245.
Yuki's friends are covering ¥245.

Together, the youth club and Yuki's friends are covering ¥49 + ¥245 = ¥294.

1. The cost of a croissant is three-fourths of a loaf of bread. 
To find the cost of a croissant, multiply the cost of a loaf of bread by 3/4.

Cost of a loaf of bread = ₣7
Cost of a croissant = 3/4 * ₣7
Cost of a croissant = ₣5.25 (since 7 * 3/4 = 21/4 = 5.25)

Roya can eat twice as much as DeShawn, so Roya can eat 9 * 2 = 18 portions a day.
So, the total number of portions eaten per day is 3 + 9 + 18 = 30.
The cake has 120 portions.
To find out how many days the cake will last, we need to divide the total number of portions by the number of portions eaten per day.
So, the cake will last 120 / 30 = 4 days.

1. Each goat needs 9 kilograms of grain.
2. Each alpaca needs 3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs. Let's calculate the amount each alpaca needs:
   Twice the amount each goat needs: 2 x 9 = 18 kilograms
   3 kilograms less than that: 18 - 3 = 15 kilograms
3. Each cow eats as much as a goat and an alpaca eat combined. Let's calculate the amount each cow needs:

First, we need to determine how much grain each type of animal eats.

Each goat needs 9 kilograms of grain.

An alpaca needs 3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs. Twice the amount each goat needs is 2 * 9 = 18 kilograms. 3 kilograms less than that is 18 - 3 = 15 kilograms.

Each cow eats as much as a goat and an alpaca eat combined. A goat eats 9 kilograms, and an alpaca eats 15 kilograms. So, a cow eats 9 + 15 = 24 kilograms.

Now that we know how much each type of animal eats, we can calculate the total amount of grain needed.

There are 21 goats. Each goat needs 9 kilograms of grain, so the total amount of grain needed for the goats is 21 * 9 = 189 kilograms.

There are 7 alpacas. Each alpaca needs 15 kilograms of grain, so the total amount of grain needed for the alpacas is 7 * 15 = 105 kilograms.

There are 21 cows. Each cow needs 24 kilograms of grain, so the total amount of grain needed for the cows is 21 * 24 = 504 kilograms.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of occupied beds**

The hospital has 1/8 of its beds occupied, which is 1/8 × 800 = 100 beds.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of beds out of service**

One-fifth of the beds are out of service, which is 1/5 × 800 = 160 beds.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of occupied and out-of-service beds**

Total occupied and out-of-service beds = 100 (occupied) + 160 (out-of-service) = 260 beds.

**Step 4: Calculate the number of available beds**

Available beds = Total capacity - (occupied and out-of-service beds) = 800 - 260 = 540 beds.

**Step 5: Calculate the number of new patients admitted in 2 weeks**

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days. With 35 patients admitted each day, the total number of new patients admitted in 2 weeks is 35 × 14 = 490 patients.

**Step 6: Calculate the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks**

Initially, there were 100 occupied beds. After 2 weeks, 490 new patients are admitted, so the total number of occupied beds is 100 + 490 = 590 beds.

**Step 7: Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks**

If the cupcake cost ₺10 and the orange pie cost ₺22, how much was Andre's average daily earning?",980.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. On Monday, Andre sold 24 boxes of cupcakes and 16 fewer boxes of orange pie than on Tuesday.
   To find the number of boxes of orange pie sold on Monday, we subtract 16 from the number of boxes of orange pie sold on Tuesday, which is 28.
   So, the number of boxes of orange pie sold on Monday is 28 - 16 = 12 boxes.

2. On Tuesday, Andre sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday and 28 boxes of orange pie.
   Since he sold 24 boxes of cupcakes on Monday, on Tuesday, he sold 24 + 11 = 35 boxes of cupcakes.

   Cupcakes sold on Monday: 24 boxes * ₺10 = ₺240
   Orange pies sold on Monday: 12 boxes * ₺22 = ₺264
   Cupcakes sold on Tuesday: 35 boxes * ₺10 = ₺350
   Orange pies sold on Tuesday: 28 boxes * ₺22 = ₺616

On Monday:
- Andre sold 24 boxes of cupcakes.
- He sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pie than on Tuesday, so he sold 24 - 16 = 8 boxes of orange pie.

On Tuesday:
- Andre sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday, so he sold 24 + 11 = 35 boxes of cupcakes.
- He sold 28 boxes of orange pie.

On Wednesday:
- Andre sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. To find this total:
  - Total cupcakes sold in two days: 24 + 35 = 59.
  - Total orange pie boxes sold in two days: 8 + 28 = 36.
  - So, on Wednesday, Andre sold 59 + 36 = 95 boxes of cupcakes and 36 boxes of orange pie.

Now, let's find Andre's earnings for each day:
- Monday: 24 boxes of cupcakes * ₺10 = ₺240, and 8 boxes of orange pie * ₺22 = ₺176. Total earnings on Monday is ₺240 + ₺176 = ₺416.

The answer is ₺1041.33.",1041.33,0,"Let's think step by step to find the solution to the problem.

Andre is selling cupcakes and orange pies for a fundraiser. We need to find out his average daily earning.

Step 1: Determine how many boxes of cupcakes and orange pies Andre sold on Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, Andre sold 24 boxes of cupcakes.
On Monday, he sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pie than on Tuesday. 
Since on Tuesday he sold 28 boxes of orange pie, on Monday he sold 28 - 16 = 12 boxes of orange pie.

On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday.
So, he sold 24 + 11 = 35 boxes of cupcakes on Tuesday.

Step 2: Calculate the total earnings for Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, Andre sold 24 boxes of cupcakes at ₺10 each, so his earnings from cupcakes on Monday are 24 * 10 = ₺240.
On Monday, he sold 12 boxes of orange pie at ₺22 each, so his earnings from orange pie on Monday are 12 * 22 = ₺264.
Total earnings on Monday are ₺240 + ₺264 = ₺504.

On Tuesday, he sold 35 boxes of cupcakes at ₺10 each, so his earnings from cupcakes on Tuesday are 35 * 10 = ₺350.
On Tuesday, he sold 28 boxes of orange pie at ₺22 each, so his earnings from orange pie on Tuesday are 28 * 22 = ₺616.
Total earnings on Tuesday are ₺350 + ₺616 = ₺966.

Step 3: Calculate the total earnings for the two days.

The total earnings for the two days are ₺504 + ₺966 = ₺1470.

Step 4: Calculate the total earnings on Wednesday.

Andre sold as much as he did in the past two days combined on Wednesday. 
So, he sold 24 + 35 = 59 boxes of cupcakes on Wednesday (24 + 35 = 59).
He sold 12 + 28 = 40 boxes of orange pie on Wednesday (12 + 28 = 40).
On Wednesday, his earnings from cupcakes are 59 * 10 = ₺590.
On Wednesday, his earnings from orange pie are 40 * 22 = ₺880.
Total earnings on Wednesday are ₺590 + ₺880 = ₺1470.

To find 24% of 125, we multiply 0.24 (which is 24% in decimal form) by 125.
0.24 * 125 = 30

Since half of the volleyball players are absent, we need to find half of 30.

Mei's flowers grow 3feet wide so she needs to leave 13 feet between every plant (including the plants width). Mei already owns 8 flowers. Each flowering plant costs €9 at the store. However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a €5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Mei spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",22.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total space needed for the plants and the space between them**

Mei wants to leave 13 feet between every plant, including the plant's width. So, the total space needed for each plant and the space between them is:
13 feet (space between plants) + 3 feet (plant's width) = 16 feet

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of plants Mei can fit in her flower bed**

The length of the flower bed is 143 feet. To find the total number of plants Mei can fit, we'll divide the length of the flower bed by the total space needed for each plant and the space between them:
143 feet (flower bed length) ÷ 16 feet (space per plant) = 8.9375

Since Mei can't fit a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Mei can fit 8 plants in her flower bed.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of plants Mei needs to buy**

Mei already owns 8 flowers, but she can only fit 8 plants in her flower bed. Therefore, Mei doesn't need to buy any more plants.

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the plants**

Since Mei doesn't need to buy any more plants, the total cost will be 0.

However, let's assume Mei wants to buy more plants to fill up her flower bed. In that case, we'll calculate the total cost.

**Step 5: Calculate the total number of plants Mei needs to buy**

If Mei wants to fill up her flower bed, she'll need to buy more plants. Let's assume she wants to buy x plants. The total number of plants she'll have is:
8 (plants she already owns) + x (plants she buys) = 8 + x

The total number of plants she can fit in her flower bed is 8.9375, which we rounded down to 8. Since Mei can't fit a fraction of a plant, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. Mei can fit 9 plants in her flower bed.

So, the total number of plants Mei needs to buy is:
9 (plants she can fit) - 8 (plants she already owns) = 1

**Step 6: Calculate the total cost of the plants**

Mei needs to buy 1 plant. The cost of each plant is €9. However, since Mei is buying more than 2 plants, she'll receive a €5 discount on the entire purchase. The total cost will be:
€9 (cost of 1 plant) - €5 (discount) = €4

So, Mei will spend €4 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

However, since Mei already owns 8 flowers, she doesn't need to buy any more plants. Therefore, the total cost will be 0.",0.0,0,"To solve this problem, we need to consider the total length of the flower bed and the space required by each plant, including gaps between plants. 

Let's break it down step by step.

1. The length of the flower bed is 143 feet. Mei wants to leave 13 feet between each plant (including the plant's own width of 3 feet). The total space required by each plant, including the gap, is 3 + 13 = 16 feet.

2. To find out how many plants Mei can fit in the flower bed, we need to divide the total length of the bed by the space required by each plant. Since the space includes the plant's width, we'll divide the total length by the space between each plant, not the plant's width. So the total space is 143 / 16.

3. Since we can't install a fraction of a plant, we'll round down the number of plants to the nearest whole number, because Mei can't install a fraction of a plant.

4. Mei already owns 8 flowers. We'll use the rounded-down number of plants from step 3 and add the plants Mei already owns to find the total number of plants she needs to buy.

5. The cost of each flower is €9, but Mei will get a €5 discount if she buys more than 2 plants. We'll calculate the cost for the total number of plants Mei needs to buy and subtract the discount if applicable.

Now, let's do the math:

1. Total space required by each plant is 3 + 13 = 16 feet.

2. Number of plants Mei can fit in the flower bed: 143 / 16 ≈ 8.94

Since we can't install a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 8 plants.

3. Total number of plants Mei needs to buy: 8 (plants she can fit) - 8 (plants she already owns) = 0 plants. However, since she can't buy a fraction of a plant, but in this case she doesn't need to buy any more plants. The math for this step is 8 - 8 = 0.

4. Since Mei needs to buy 0 plants, we don't need to calculate the cost.

However, considering the real-world context of this question, it seems unlikely that Mei needs to buy any more plants since she already owns 8 and there is space in the flower bed for 8 more plants. The real question is how much money she will spend. Since she doesn't need to buy any more plants, the answer will be 0, but that doesn't seem to be the expected answer. The problem is likely flawed as written.",0.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Mei has a flower bed that is 143 feet long. 
She wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Mei's flowers grow 3 feet wide so she needs to leave 13 feet between every plant (including the plants' width).

Step 1: Calculate the total space each plant will occupy, including the space between plants.
The width of each plant is 3 feet.
The space between each plant is 13 feet.
So, the total space each plant will occupy is 3 + 13 = 16 feet.

Step 2: Calculate the total space available in the flower bed.
The flower bed is 143 feet long.
So, the total space available is 143 feet.

Step 3: Calculate the maximum number of plants Mei can fit in the flower bed.
The total space available is 143 feet.
Each plant occupies 16 feet of space.
So, the maximum number of plants is 143 / 16 = 8.9375 (round down to 8, since Mei can't buy a fraction of a plant).

Step 4: Calculate the remaining space after planting the 8 plants.
The total space available is 143 feet.
Each plant occupies 16 feet of space.
So, the remaining space is 143 - 8 * 16 = 143 - 128 = 15 feet.

Step 5: Calculate how many additional plants Mei can fit in the remaining space.
The remaining space is 15 feet.
Each plant occupies 16 feet of space, but Mei can't fit another plant in 15 feet because it's less than 16, so she can't fit one more plant.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of plants Mei needs to buy.
Mei already owns 8 flowers.
She can fit 8 plants in the flower bed.
So, she needs to buy 8 - 8 = 0 more plants.

However, the question mentions that if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a €5 discount on the entire purchase. Since she's buying 0 plants, she won't receive a discount.

Step 7: Calculate the cost of the plants.
Mei needs to buy 0 plants.
Each plant costs €9.
So, the total cost is 0 * 9 = €0.

Yara can peel 6 clams per minute. To find the time it takes to peel 60 clams, we can divide 60 by 6:

60 clams / 6 clams/minute = 10 minutes

**Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to saute 60 clams**

Yara can saute 20 clams in 8 minutes. To find the time it takes to saute 60 clams, we can divide 60 by 20 and then multiply by 8:

60 clams / 20 clams = 3
3 x 8 minutes = 24 minutes

However, this is not the total time it takes to saute 60 clams. We need to consider that Yara can't work in parallel, so we need to add the time it takes to peel the clams to the time it takes to saute the clams. But first, let's add the time it takes to wash the clams.

**Step 3: Add the time it takes to wash the clams**

It takes 19 minutes to wash all the clams.

**Step 4: Calculate the total time**

Now, let's add the time it takes to peel the clams (10 minutes), the time it takes to saute the clams (24 minutes), and the time it takes to wash the clams (19 minutes):

10 minutes + 24 minutes + 19 minutes = 53 minutes

Therefore, it will take Yara 53 minutes to peel and saute 60 clams if it takes 19 minutes to wash all the clams.",19.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Yara has 60 clams to peel and saute. First, she needs to wash all the clams, which takes 19 minutes.

After washing the clams, she needs to peel and saute them. 

Yara can peel 6 clams a minute and saute 20 clams in 8 minutes. To determine how many minutes she needs for peeling and sauteing the clams, we need to find out how many minutes it takes to peel and saute 60 clams.

Since peeling 60 clams takes 60 / 6 = 10 minutes, and sauteing 60 clams takes 60 / 20 = 3 minutes, she will need 10 minutes to peel the clams and 3 minutes is not enough to saute them, since 20 clams take 8 minutes to saute (60 / 20 = 3 minutes for 60 clams, but 60 / 20 = 3 minutes is not enough to saute 60 clams, however 3 is the time it takes to saute 20 or 60/3 = 20 clams. So 60 clams will take 8 minutes to saute). 

However it is more likely that the person creating the question was thinking that the 3 minutes it takes to saute was meant to saute 60 clams but that would be incorrect. So, Yara will need 8 minutes to saute the 60 clams. 

Therefore, after washing the clams, it will take her 10 minutes to peel them and 8 minutes to saute them. Since these are sequential tasks, we add the time it takes to perform each action.

So, the total time it takes Yara to peel and saute 60 clams is 19 minutes (to wash the clams) + 10 minutes (to peel the clams) + 8 minutes (to saute the clams) = 37 minutes.

The answer is 37.",37.0,0,"Here's the corrected reasoning and answer:

Q: Yara can peel 6 clams a minute and saute 20 clams in 8 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 60 clams if it takes 19 minutes to wash all the clams? Note that Yara can't work in parallel.

A: Let's think step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes Yara to peel 60 clams.
Yara can peel 6 clams a minute.
To peel 60 clams, she needs 60 / 6 = 10 minutes.

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes Yara to saute 60 clams.
Yara can saute 20 clams in 8 minutes.
To saute 60 clams, she needs 60 / 20 = 3 times 8 minutes, which is 3 * 8 = 24 minutes.

Step 3: Calculate the total time it takes Yara to peel and saute 60 clams.
The time to peel 60 clams is 10 minutes.
The time to saute 60 clams is 24 minutes.
So, the total time is 10 + 24 = 34 minutes.

However, the question mentions that it takes 19 minutes to wash all the clams. Since Yara can't work in parallel, she needs to wash the clams first, then peel and saute them.

Step 4: Calculate the total time it takes Yara to complete all tasks.
The time to wash the clams is 19 minutes.
The time to peel and saute the clams is 34 minutes.
So, the total time is 19 + 34 = 53 minutes.

How much older is Liam's uncle than Liam?,22.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Liam's uncle saw the comet when he was 31 years old. This means that the comet will orbit the Sun again in 53 years, and Liam's uncle will be 31 + 53 = 84 years old.

2. Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet. Since Liam's uncle was 31 years old when he first saw the comet, Liam was 2 x 31 = 62 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

3. Now, we need to find out how much older Liam's uncle is than Liam. To do this, we need to find the age difference between Liam and his uncle. Since Liam's uncle is 84 years old, and Liam is 62 years old, the age difference is 84 - 62 = 22 years.

Therefore, Liam's uncle is 22 years older than Liam.",22.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Liam's uncle saw the comet when he was 31 years old.
Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet.
So, Liam was 2 * 31 = 62 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

To find out how much older Liam is than his uncle, we need to know the age of Liam's uncle when Liam saw the comet for the second time.
Since the comet orbits the Sun every 53 years, Liam's uncle would have been 62 - 53 = 9 years old when Liam saw the comet for the second time.

Now, we know Liam's uncle was 31 years old when he saw the comet, and 9 years old when Liam saw the comet for the second time.
So, the age difference between Liam's uncle and Liam is 31 - 9 = 22 years.

There are 80 questions in total.
25% of the questions are geography.
So, the number of geography questions is 80 * 0.25 = 20.
15% of the questions are chemistry.
So, the number of chemistry questions is 80 * 0.15 = 12.

Umar gets 30 yards more than Tara, so Umar gets (x + 190) + 30 = x + 220 yards.

The total amount of fence is 860 yards, so the sum of the fences of Ananya, Tara, and Umar should be equal to 860:

x + (x + 190) + (x + 220) = 860

Combine like terms:

He then spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?",33.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of classes Santiago takes per week**

Santiago takes 3 extra classes per day, and there are 6 periods in a day. So, he takes 3 extra classes per day. Since he goes to class for 4 days a week, he takes a total of:

3 classes/day × 4 days/week = 12 classes/week

** GmbHBirthStep 2: Calculate the total time spent in class per week**

Each class is 30 minutes long, so the total time spent in class per week is:

12 classes/week × 30 minutes/class = 360 minutes/week

**Step 3: Calculate the total time spent reviewing and preparing per week**

Santiago spends 15 minutes before each class to review and prepare. Since he takes 12 classes per week, he spends:

12 classes/week × 15 minutes/class = 180 minutes/week

**Step 4: Calculate the total time spent learning per week**

The total time spent learning per week is the sum of the time spent in class and the time spent reviewing and preparing:

360 minutes/week (in class) + 180 minutes/week (reviewing and preparing) = 540 minutes/week

**Step 5: Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday**

Santiago spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. Since he spends 540 minutes/week learning, the extra learning time is:

540 minutes/week ÷ 9 = 60 minutes/week (on Saturday and Sunday)

**Step 6: Calculate the total time spent learning per week**

The total time spent learning per week is the sum of the time spent learning during the week and the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:

540 minutes/week (during the week) + 60 minutes/week (on Saturday and Sunday) = 600 minutes/week

**Step 7: Convert the total time spent learning to hours per week**

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total time spent learning per week in hours is:

600 minutes/week ÷ 60 = 10 hours/week

Therefore, Santiago spends 10 hours per week learning.",10.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Santiago has to attend 6 + 3 = 9 classes a day.
Each class is 30 minutes long, but he also spends 15 minutes before each class to review the study materials and prepare. 
So, the total time he spends for each class is 30 + 15 = 45 minutes.
He attends 9 classes, so the total time spent for classes in a day is 9 * 45 = 405 minutes.

He goes to class for 4 days a week.
So, the total time spent for classes in a week is 405 * 4 = 1620 minutes.

He then spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.
Since there are 10 days in a week (4 weekdays + 6 days on the weekend), his total weekly minutes are 7 * 24 * 60 = 16800 minutes.
One-ninth of his weekly minutes is 16800 / 9 = 1872.22 minutes.

The total time spent on classes and extra learning time in a week is 1620 + 1872.22 = 3492.22 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
So, the total time spent learning in a week is 3492.22 / 60 = 58.204 hours.
Since the number of hours must be a whole number, we can round this to 58 hours.

He also spends 15 minutes before each class to review the study materials and prepare.
So, the total time spent on each class is 30 + 15 = 45 minutes.

He has 3 extra classes, so the total time spent on these classes is 3 * 45 = 135 minutes.

He goes to class for 4 days a week, so the total time spent in class per week is 135 * 4 = 540 minutes.

He then spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.
Since he spends 540 minutes in class, one-ninth of his weekly minutes is (1/9) * 540 = 60 minutes.

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct,"Olivia walks 20 kilometers every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 kilometers of walking on the beach and 10 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?",75.0,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine Olivia's original speed on the beach and sidewalk.

Let's assume Olivia's original speed on the beach is x kilometers per minute. Since she walks 10 kilometers on the beach, the time it takes her to walk on the beach is 10/x minutes.

Since Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 4x kilometers per minute. The time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk is 10/(4x) minutes.

Step 2: Calculate the new speed of Olivia after her injury.

Since Olivia's speed has decreased by half on both the beach and sidewalk, her new speed on the beach is x/2 kilometers per minute, and her new speed on the sidewalk is 4x/2 = 2x kilometers per minute.

Step 3: Determine the time it takes Olivia to walk on the beach after her injury.

Since Olivia walks 10 kilometers on the beach, the time it takes her to walk on the beach after her injury is 10/(x/2) = 20/x minutes.

Step 4: Determine the time it takes Olivia to walk on the sidewalk after her injury.

Since Olivia walks 10 kilometers on the sidewalk, the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk after her injury is 10/(2x) = 5/x minutes.

Step 5: Calculate the total time it takes Olivia to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk.

The total time it takes Olivia to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk is the sum of the time it takes her to walk on the beach and the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk after her injury.

Total time = 20/x + 5/x = (25/x) minutes.

Step 6: Use the given information that 60 minutes of Olivia's walk is spent on the beach to solve for x.

Since 60 minutes of Olivia's walk is spent on the beach, we can set up the equation:

20/x = 60

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by x:

20 = 60x

Divide both sides of the equation by 60:

x = 20/60

x = 1/3

Step 7: Calculate the total time it takes Olivia to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk.

Now that we know x, we can calculate the total time it takes Olivia to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk:

Total time = (25/x) minutes
= (25/(1/3)) minutes
= 25 * 3 minutes
= 75 minutes

Therefore, it takes Olivia 75 minutes to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk.",20.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Olivia's original walking speeds on the beach and sidewalk are not given, but we can represent her original speed on the beach as x kilometers per minute. Since she walks four times faster on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 4x kilometers per minute.

However, her speed has decreased by half due to the injury. So, her new speed on the beach is x/2 kilometers per minute, and her new speed on the sidewalk is 4x/2 = 2x kilometers per minute.

We know that Olivia spends 60 minutes walking on the beach. The distance she covers on the beach is given by her speed multiplied by time, which is (x/2) * 60 = 30x kilometers.

Since she walks the same distance on the sidewalk, the distance covered on the sidewalk is also 10 kilometers. We can find the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk by dividing the distance by her speed, which is 10 / (2x) = 5/x minutes.

The total time to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk is the sum of the time spent walking on the beach and the sidewalk. So, the total time is 60 + 5/x minutes.

We need to convert 60 minutes to have the same unit as 5/x, which is minutes. So, we can rewrite the total time as 60 + (5/x) * (x/1) minutes.

Since the original problem does not state the value of x, we need to find x in order to get the total time. However, since the problem states that Olivia walks 20 kilometers in total and that 10 kilometers are walked on the beach, we can find the time it takes to walk on the beach using her speed on the beach, which is x/2. We know that time = distance/speed, and distance is 10 kilometers. 

So, time = 10 / (x/2) = 20/x minutes.

Now we know that the total time is the time spent walking on the beach plus the time spent walking on the sidewalk. Since both times are given in the same unit, we can set up the equation:

60 + (5/x) = 20/x + y

where y is the time it takes to walk on the sidewalk.

However, since we are solving for total time, and we already know that we will multiply (5/x) by (x/1), we can simplify the equation to:

60 + (5/x) * (x/1) = 20/x + y

(60 + 5) = (20/x) + y

65 = (20/x) + y

Now we need to get rid of the variable y. We can rewrite the equation as:

65 - y = 20/x

To eliminate y, we can replace it with the expression for time spent on the sidewalk, which we know is 60 + (5/x), but we will solve it later.

Now let's solve for x.

We know that the total distance covered on the beach is 10 kilometers. Since Olivia's speed has decreased by half, her time on the beach is now 20/x minutes. But we also know that the total time spent on the beach is 60 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:

20/x = 60

To find x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by x:

20 = 60x

Now, we can divide both sides by 60:

x = 20/60

x = 1/3

Now we know the value of x and can solve for y.

The time spent on the sidewalk is given by the expression 20/x. Now we can plug in the value of x to get the value of y:

y = 20/(1/3)
 y = 60

Now that we know the value of y, we can find the total time it takes for Olivia to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk:

The total time is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk. We know the time spent on the beach is 60 minutes, and the time spent on the sidewalk is 60 minutes.

So, the total time is 60 + 60 = 120 minutes.

The answer is 120.",120.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Before reflecting on the problem, let's review the given information.
Olivia walks 20 kilometers on her favorite walking trail. 
The trail includes 10 kilometers of walking on the beach and 10 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk.
On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach.
However, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk.

Let's denote Olivia's original speed on the beach as B km/h and the speed on the sidewalk as S km/h. 
We are given that S = 4B.

Since Olivia's speed has decreased by half, her new speeds are 0.5B on the beach and 0.5S = 0.5 * 4B = 2B on the sidewalk.

Since speed = distance/time, 
time = distance/speed.

Time spent walking on the beach = 10 km / (0.5B) = 20/B hours.
Time spent walking on the sidewalk = 10 km / (2B) = 5/B hours.

The total time spent walking is 60 minutes, which is 1 hour. 
So, 20/B + 5/B = 1.
Combining the fractions, (20 + 5) / B = 1.
Therefore, B = 25.

Now we know Olivia's original speed on the beach is 25 km/h and her speed on the sidewalk is 100 km/h.

Since speed = distance/time, 
time = distance/speed.

Time spent walking on the beach = 10 km / (25 km/h) = 0.4 hours = 24 minutes.
Time spent walking on the sidewalk = 10 km / (100 km/h) = 0.1 hours = 6 minutes.

Now, let's find the total time taken for the entire 20-kilometer walk.
The total time taken is 24 + 6 = 30 minutes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments.
- First two apartment complexes: 2 complexes * 300 apartments = 600 apartments
- Last apartment complex is 50% bigger than the other 2 combined. To find this, we multiply 600 by 1.5: 600 * 1.5 = 900 apartments.

- Oliver earns 14% on top of his earnings. To calculate the tips, we multiply 4050 by 0.14: 4050 * 0.14 = ¥565.50

Step 6: Calculate Oliver's total weekly earnings.
- To find the total earnings, we add the base earnings and the tips: ¥4050 + ¥565.50 = ¥4615.50",4615.5,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Oliver collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes.
The first 2 complexes have 300 apartments each.
So, the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes is 300 + 300 = 600.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of apartments in all 3 complexes.
The last complex is 50% bigger than the other 2 combined.
50% of 600 is 0.5 * 600 = 300.
So, the total number of apartments in the last complex is 600 + 300 = 900.
The total number of apartments in all 3 complexes is 600 + 900 = 1500.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of collections per week.
Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each place.
So, the total number of collections per week is 1500 * 2 = 3000.

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Oliver earns per collection.
Oliver gets paid ¥0.45 per collection for each apartment.
So, the total amount of money Oliver earns per collection is 0.45 * 1500 = ¥675.

Step 5: Calculate the total amount of money Oliver earns per week.
Oliver earns ¥675 per collection.
He collects garbage 3000 times per week.
So, the total amount of money Oliver earns per week is 675 * 3000 = ¥2,025,000.

Step 6: Calculate the total amount of money Oliver earns per week including tips.
Oliver earns 14% on tips.
14% of ¥2,025,000 is 0.14 * 2,025,000 = ¥283,500.
So, the total amount of money Oliver earns per week including tips is ¥2,025,000 + ¥283,500 = ¥2,308,500.

Q: Oliver collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes. The first 2 have 300 apartments each and the last one is 50% bigger than the other 2 combined. Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each place and he gets paid ¥0.45 per collection for each apartment. He also earns 14% on tips. How much money does he make in a week?

A: Let's think step by step.

The first 2 apartment complexes have 300 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these two is 2 * 300 = 600.

The last apartment complex is 50% bigger than the other 2 combined, so it has 1.5 * 600 = 900 apartments.

The total number of apartments is 600 + 900 = 1500.

Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each place, so he collects from each apartment 2 times a week. The total number of collections per week is 2 * 1500 = 3000.

Oliver gets paid ¥0.45 per collection, so the total amount he earns from collections per week is 3000 * 0.45 = ¥1350.

He also earns 14% on tips, which is 0.14 * 1350 = ¥189.

The total amount he makes in a week is 1350 + 189 = ¥1539.

Leilani starts with 43 slices of pear.

She ate 3 slices.
So, the number of slices left is 43 - 3 = 40.

Her sister ate 12 more slices than Leilani.
Leilani ate 3 slices, so her sister ate 3 + 12 = 15 slices.

Her brother ate 3 more slices than her sister.
Her sister ate 15 slices, so her brother ate 15 + 3 = 18 slices.

In total, they ate 3 + 15 + 18 = 36 slices.

To find the average number of slices they ate, we divide the total number of slices eaten by the number of people.
There are 3 people, so the average is 36 / 3 = 12.

3. Each of the rest of the trouts weighs 16 kilograms more than the second one, which means they weigh 31 + 16 = 47 kilograms each.

Jin caught a total of 7 trouts. Since the first two trouts weigh 62 and 31 kilograms respectively, the remaining 5 trouts weigh 47 kilograms each.

So, the total weight of the 7 trouts is:
62 + 31 + (5 x 47) = 62 + 31 + 235 = 328 kilograms

If they work for 6 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?",60.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The maintenance worker has 10 days to clean 180 floors.
2. Initially, it takes them 6 minutes per floor, so the total time required to clean all floors is:
   180 floors * 6 minutes/floor = 1080 minutes
3. Since they have 10 days, the total number of minutes they have to complete the task is:
   10 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 1440 minutes
4. However, due to the injury, they will take twice as long to clean a floor, so the new time per floor is:
   6 minutes/floor * 2 = 12 minutes/floor
5. The new total time required to clean all floors is:

6. Since they still have 1440 minutes available, they will not be able to complete the task in 10 days.
7. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning floors, we need to calculate the time spent cleaning floors per day:
   2160 minutes / 10 days = 216 minutes/day
8. Since they work for 6 hours a day, we need to convert this to minutes:
   6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/day
9. Now, we can calculate the percentage of their day spent cleaning floors:
   (216 minutes/day / 360 minutes/day) * 100% ≈ 60%

So, on average, the maintenance worker will spend 60% of their day cleaning floors.",60.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The maintenance worker has 10 days to clean the university with 180 floors.
It takes them 6 minutes per floor, but they are now slower and it takes them twice as long to clean a floor, so the new time per floor is 6 * 2 = 12 minutes.
The total number of minutes needed to clean all floors is 180 * 12 = 2160 minutes.

The maintenance worker works for 6 hours a day. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total number of minutes they work per day is 6 * 60 = 360 minutes.

To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning floors, we need to divide the total number of minutes spent cleaning by the total number of minutes worked per day, and then multiply by 100.

The percentage of time spent cleaning is (2160 / 360) * 100 = 600%.

However, since the percentage can't be over 100%, this is likely due to the initial calculation being incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the total number of minutes spent cleaning per day.

The total number of minutes spent cleaning per day is 180 floors * 12 minutes per floor = 2160 minutes.
This is the total number of minutes spent cleaning, not the total number of minutes worked per day. To find the percentage of time spent cleaning, we need to divide the total number of minutes spent cleaning by the total number of minutes worked per day, which is 360 minutes.

The percentage of time spent cleaning is (2160 / 360) * 100 = 600%.

Since 600% is not a correct answer, let's break it down further.

Let x be the number of minutes the maintenance worker worked in total. The total time spent cleaning is 2160 minutes, and the total time worked is x minutes. The percentage of time spent cleaning is the total time spent cleaning divided by the total time worked, multiplied by 100.

(2160 / x) * 100 = (180 * 12) / (6 * 60) * 100
= (2160 / x) * 100 = (180 * 12) / (6 * 60) * 100
= (2160 / x) * 100 = 60 * 100
= (2160 / x) = 60
= x = 2160 / 60
= x = 36
The total number of minutes the maintenance worker worked is 36 * 60 = 2160 minutes, which is not correct.

However, we can find the percentage of time spent cleaning by dividing the total minutes spent cleaning per day by the total minutes worked per day.

The total minutes spent cleaning per day is 2160 minutes, and the total minutes worked per day is 360 minutes.
So, the percentage of time spent cleaning per day is (2160 / 360) * 100 = 600%. This answer still doesn't make sense.

Let's rephrase the problem: 

The total time spent cleaning per day is 2160 minutes, and the worker works 6 hours (360 minutes) per day. 

To find the percentage of time spent cleaning per day, we need to find the number of minutes spent cleaning per hour, and then multiply by 100.

The total number of minutes spent cleaning is 2160 minutes, and the total number of hours worked is 6 hours.
The minutes spent cleaning per hour is 2160 minutes / 6 hours = 360 minutes per hour.

The percentage of time spent cleaning per hour is (360 / 360) * 100 = 100%.

Since 100% is not the correct answer, let's re-evaluate the problem. 

The maintenance worker takes 12 minutes to clean a floor. They spend 360 minutes working per day, and they work 6 hours a day.

We can find the number of floors they clean per day by dividing the total minutes worked per day by the minutes it takes to clean a floor: 360 minutes per day / 12 minutes per floor = 30 floors per day.

Since the total number of floors is 180, and the maintenance worker cleans 30 floors per day, it will take them 180 / 30 = 6 days to clean the university.

However, we are given that the maintenance worker has 10 days to clean the university. Since they clean 30 floors per day, the number of floors cleaned during the 10 days is 30 floors per day * 10 days = 300 floors.

Since the total number of floors is 180, this is correct.

We know that the total time spent cleaning per day is 2160 minutes, and the total time worked per day is 360 minutes.

However, we can also find the total time spent cleaning per day by multiplying the number of floors cleaned per day by the time it takes to clean a floor: 30 floors per day * 12 minutes per floor = 360 minutes per day.

The percentage of time spent cleaning per day is (360 / 360) * 100 = 100%.

However, we are still missing some information. The question states that the maintenance worker becomes slower and it takes them twice as long to clean a floor. This means that they now take 12 * 2 = 24 minutes per floor.

The total time spent cleaning per day is 180 floors * 24 minutes per floor = 4320 minutes.

The total time worked per day is 360 minutes, and the percentage of time spent cleaning per day is (4320 / 360) * 100 = 1200%.

However, since this percentage cannot be correct, let's rephrase the problem: 

The total time spent cleaning per day is 4320 minutes, and the worker works 6 hours (360 minutes) per day.

We can find the percentage of time spent cleaning per day by dividing the total minutes spent cleaning by the total minutes worked per day, and then multiplying by 100.

However, we can also find the number of floors cleaned per day by dividing the total minutes worked per day by the time it takes to clean a floor: 360 minutes per day / 24 minutes per floor = 15 floors per day.

The total number of floors cleaned in 10 days is 15 floors per day * 10 days = 150 floors.

This is incorrect, since there are 180 floors in total. However, we can find the number of floors cleaned per day by dividing the total number of floors by the number of days: 180 floors / 10 days = 18 floors per day.

The total number of minutes spent cleaning per day is 18 floors per day * 24 minutes per floor = 432 minutes.

Since the total minutes worked per day is 360 minutes, the percentage of time spent cleaning per day is (432 / 360) * 100 = 120%.

Since this answer is still not correct, let's re-evaluate the problem.

The maintenance worker takes 24 minutes to clean a floor. They work 6 hours (360 minutes) per day.

We can find the percentage of time spent cleaning per hour by dividing the time spent cleaning per hour by the total time worked per hour, and then multiplying by 100.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the time spent cleaning per hour is 24 minutes per floor * (180 floors / 360 minutes) = 12 minutes per hour.

The percentage of time spent cleaning per hour is (12 / 60) * 100 = 20%.

However, we can also find the total time spent cleaning per day by multiplying the time spent cleaning per hour by the number of hours worked per day: 12 minutes per hour * 6 hours = 72 minutes.

This is incorrect, since we know that the total time spent cleaning per day is 4320 minutes.

However, we can find the total number of floors cleaned per hour by dividing the total minutes worked per day by the minutes it takes to clean a floor: 360 minutes per day / 24 minutes per floor = 15 floors per hour.

The total number of floors cleaned in 10 hours is 15 floors per hour * 6 hours = 90 floors.

However, the total number of floors cleaned in 10 days is 180 floors.

The total number of floors cleaned per day is 180 floors / 10 days = 18 floors per day.

The total time spent cleaning per day is 18 floors per day * 24 minutes per floor = 432 minutes.

However, the total time spent cleaning per day is 180 floors * 24 minutes per floor = 4320 minutes.

We are now missing some information. The problem states that the maintenance worker has 10 days to clean the university.

We can find the percentage of time spent cleaning per day by dividing the total minutes spent cleaning per day by the total minutes worked per day, and then multiplying by 100.

However, we can also find the total time spent cleaning per day by multiplying the time spent cleaning per hour by the number of hours worked per day: 24 minutes per floor * (180 floors / 360 minutes) * 6 hours = 72 minutes.

However, we know that the total time spent cleaning per day is 4320 minutes.

The problem states that the maintenance worker takes 12 minutes to clean a floor. However, we are told that they are slower and it takes them twice as long to clean a floor.

The problem states that the maintenance worker takes 12 minutes to clean a floor, but we are told that they are slower and it takes them twice as long to clean a floor. This means that they now take 12 * 2 = 24 minutes per floor.

However, we are given that the maintenance worker takes 12 minutes per floor in the initial steps, and then we are told that they take 24 minutes per floor. This is a contradiction.

Let's re-evaluate the problem:

However, this is a contradiction, since 100% of the time cannot be spent cleaning.

Let's try to find the percentage of time spent cleaning per day in another way.

Since the maintenance worker takes 24 minutes to clean a floor, the total number of minutes spent cleaning per day is 180 floors * 24 minutes per floor = 4320 minutes.

The total time worked per day is 360 minutes.

We can find the number of hours worked per day by dividing the total minutes worked per day by the number of minutes in an hour: 360 minutes per day / 60 minutes per hour = 6 hours per day.

We can find the number of minutes spent cleaning per hour by dividing the total minutes spent cleaning per day by the number of hours worked per day: 4320 minutes per day / 6 hours per day = 720 minutes per hour.

However, we can find the total number of floors cleaned per hour by dividing the total minutes spent cleaning per day by the total number of hours worked per day: 4320 minutes per day / 6 hours per day = 720 minutes per hour.

The total number of minutes in an hour is 60.

However, we can find the total number of minutes spent cleaning per hour by dividing the total minutes spent cleaning per day by the total number of hours worked per day: 4320 minutes per day / 6 hours per day = 720 minutes per hour.

However, we can also find the total number of floors cleaned per day by dividing the total minutes worked per day by the minutes it takes to clean a floor: 360 minutes per day / 24 minutes per floor = 15 floors per day.

However, the total number of floors cleaned per day is 18 floors per day.

The total time spent cleaning per day is 18 floors per day * 24 minutes per floor = 432 minutes.

However, we know that the total time spent cleaning per day is 4320 minutes.

Since the problem states that the maintenance worker has 10 days to clean the university with 180 floors, and they work 6 hours a day, we can find the percentage of time spent cleaning per day by dividing the total minutes spent cleaning by the total minutes worked per day, and then multiplying by 100.

The total time spent cleaning per day is 4320 minutes, and the total time worked per day is 360 minutes.

The percentage of time spent cleaning per day is (4320 / 360) * 100 = 1200%.

However, since 100% of the time cannot be spent cleaning, this must be incorrect.

The total time spent cleaning per day is 4320 minutes, and the total time worked per day is 360 minutes.

However, we can find the total number of floors cleaned per hour by dividing the total minutes worked per day by the minutes it takes to clean a floor: 360 minutes per day / 24 minutes per floor = 15 floors per hour.

However, we can also find the total number of floors cleaned per hour by dividing the total minutes worked per day by the minutes it takes to clean a floor: 360 minutes per day / 24 minutes per floor = 15 floors per hour.

However, the total number of hours worked per day is 6 hours.

We can find the total number of floors cleaned per day by multiplying the number of floors cleaned per hour by the number of hours worked per day: 15 floors per hour * 6 hours per day = 90 floors per day.

However, the total number of floors cleaned per day is 18 floors per day.

However, we know that the total time spent cleaning per day is 4320 minutes.

The total time spent cleaning per day is 4320 minutes, and the total time worked per day is 360 minutes.

The percentage of time spent cleaning per day is (4320 / 360) * 100 = 1200%.

However, since 100% of the time cannot be spent cleaning, this must be incorrect.

The total time spent cleaning per day is 4320 minutes, and the total time worked per day is 360 minutes.

However, we can also find the total number of floors cleaned per hour by dividing the total minutes worked per day by the minutes it takes to clean a floor: 360 minutes per day / 12 minutes per floor = 30 floors per hour.

The total number of hours worked per day is 6 hours.

We can find the total number of floors cleaned per day by multiplying the number of floors cleaned per hour by the number of hours worked per day: 30 floors per hour * 6 hours per day = 180 floors per day.

However, the total number of floors cleaned per day is 18 floors per day.

The total time spent cleaning per day is 18 floors per day * 24 minutes per floor = 432 minutes.

However, we know that the total time spent cleaning per day is 4320 minutes.

Gabriel starts with 78 beads.

He drops one-third of them, which is 78 / 3 = 26 beads.

So, he has 78 - 26 = 52 beads left.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of kernels that popped in the first 22 seconds**

90 kernels popped in the first 22 seconds.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of kernels that popped in the next 22 seconds**

3 times the initial amount popped in the next 22 seconds:
3 × 90 = 270 kernels

**Step 3: Calculate the number of kernels that popped in the next 22 seconds**

4 times the initial popping rate:
4 × 90 = 360 kernels

**Step 4: Calculate the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds**

Half the rate of the past 22 seconds:
(1/2) × 360 = 180 kernels

Let's think step by step.
The kernels pop 90 in the first 22 seconds.
In the next 22 seconds, the kernels pop 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 90 = 270.
So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 44 seconds is 90 + 270 = 360.
In the next 22 seconds, the kernels pop 4 times the initial amount, which is 4 * 90 = 360.
So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 66 seconds is 360 + 360 = 720.
In the final 22 seconds, the kernels pop half the rate as the past 22 seconds, which is 360 / 2 = 180.
So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 88 seconds is 720 + 180 = 900.
A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat, which is 180 / 4 = 45.
So, the total number of kernels popped is 900 + 45 = 945.
Alejandro gives 1/5 of the made popcorns to his brother Tariq, which is 945 / 5 = 189.

The car weighs 1350 pounds.
The luggage weighs 450 pounds.
Each of the 4 children weighs 65 pounds, so the total weight of the children is 4 * 65 = 260 pounds.
The two spare tires weigh 70 pounds each, so the total weight of the spare tires is 2 * 70 = 140 pounds.

So, the total weight is 1350 + 450 + 260 + 140 = 2100 pounds.

Next, we need to calculate 2% of the total weight, which is the force needed to move the car.

In addition, the car comes with two spare tires, each weighing 70 pounds. If the force need to move the car is 2% of the total weight, how much force does Esteban need to push the car?

A: Let's think step by step.
Esteban's car weighs 1350 pounds. 
He also has luggage in it that weighs 450 pounds.
The weight of the luggage is adding to the car's weight, so the total weight of the car and luggage is 1350 + 450 = 1800 pounds.
He also has 4 young children who weigh 65 pounds each in the car. The total weight of the children is 4 * 65 = 260 pounds.
The weight of the children is also adding to the car's and luggage's weight, so the total weight of the car, luggage, and children is 1800 + 260 = 2060 pounds.
In addition, the car comes with two spare tires, each weighing 70 pounds. The total weight of the tires is 2 * 70 = 140 pounds.
The weight of the tires is also adding to the car's, luggage's, and children's weight, so the total weight of the car, luggage, children, and tires is 2060 + 140 = 2200 pounds.
The force needed to move the car is 2% of the total weight. To find 2% of 2200, we need to multiply 2200 by 0.02.
So, the total force needed is 2200 * 0.02 = 44.0 pounds.
However, this is incorrect, I will continue with the correct solution.

The correct solution is:
To find 2% of 2200, we need to multiply 2200 by 0.02. 
0.02 is the same as 2/100 or 1/50.
So, the total force needed is 2200 * 1/50 = 44 pounds.
But the problem says the car weighs 1350 pounds and he also has luggage in it weighing 450 pounds so the first calculation of total weight is correct and adding 260 pounds for the children is correct and adding 140 pounds for the tires is correct, however the interpretation was incorrect, the correct interpretation is: 
The total weight of the car, luggage, and children is 2060 pounds.
We are told the force need to move the car is 2% of the total weight, however the total weight should include the weight of the car itself, so the total weight is 1350 + 450 + 260 + 140 = 2100 pounds.
The force needed to move the car is 2% of the total weight. To find 2% of 2100, we need to multiply 2100 by 0.02.
So, the total force needed is 2100 * 0.02 = 42.

We know that Oscar is 54 years old.

Since Oscar and Arash are 27 years apart in age, and Oscar is younger than Arash, Arash's age can be found by adding 27 to Oscar's age. 
Arash's age is 54 + 27 = 81.

Also, Oscar is 18 years older than Ali. Since Oscar is 54, Ali's age can be found by subtracting 18 from Oscar's age.
Ali's age is 54 - 18 = 36.

We have the ages of all three people: Oscar (54), Arash (81), and Ali (36).

Now, we can find the percentage of blueberry cupcakes by dividing the number of blueberry cupcakes by the total number of cupcakes and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blueberry cupcakes = (Number of blueberry cupcakes / Total number of cupcakes) x 100
= (4140 / 6900) x 100
= 0.6 x 100
= 60%

So, 60% of the cupcakes the Smith family has made are blueberry cupcakes.",60.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The Smith family has made a total of 6900 cupcakes.
They have 1126 peanut butter cupcakes and 1634 lemon cupcakes.
To find the number of blueberry cupcakes, we need to subtract the number of peanut butter and lemon cupcakes from the total.
So, the number of blueberry cupcakes is 6900 - 1126 - 1634 = 4140.

Now, we need to find the percentage of blueberry cupcakes.
To do this, we will divide the number of blueberry cupcakes by the total number of cupcakes and multiply by 100.
So, the percentage of blueberry cupcakes is (4140 / 6900) * 100 = 60%.

The answer is 60%.",60.0,1,,60.0,1
