gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct,"Sophia went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, and 60 mini cheesecakes. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, let's find the total cost of the donuts. There are 60 donuts in a dozen, but Sophia bought 60 donuts. So, she bought 5 dozen donuts. 
   The cost of 5 dozen donuts = 5 * 19 = 95.
   The total cost of the donuts = 95 * 5 = 475.

2. Next, let's find the total cost of the mini cupcakes. There are 60 cupcakes in a dozen, but Sophia bought 60 cupcakes. So, she bought 5 dozen mini cupcakes.
   The cost of 5 dozen mini cupcakes = 5 * 33 = 165.
   The total cost of the mini cupcakes = 165 * 5 = 825.

3. We know that Sophia paid a total of $1500 after a 20% discount. Let's assume the original price was X.
   The amount of discount = 20% of X = 0.2X
   The discounted price = X - 0.2X = 0.8X
   We know that the discounted price = $1500
   So, 0.8X = $1500
   Solve for X: X = $1500 / 0.8 = $1875. This is the original price of the items.

4. Now, let's subtract the cost of the donuts and the mini cupcakes from the original price to find the total cost of the mini cheesecakes.
   The cost of mini cheesecakes = $1875 - (475 + 825) = $575.

5. Since Sophia bought 60 mini cheesecakes, let's find the cost per dozen.
   There are 5 dozen mini cheesecakes in 60 cheesecakes.
   The cost of 60 mini cheesecakes = $575
   The cost of 1 dozen mini cheesecakes = $575 / 5 = $115.

The cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is $115.",115.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes before the discount.

Sophia bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen. Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, she bought:
60 / 12 = 5 dozen donuts.
The cost of the donuts is 5 * $19 = $95.

Next, she bought 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen. Since there are 12 cupcakes in a dozen, she bought:
60 / 12 = 5 dozen cupcakes.
The cost of the cupcakes is 5 * $33 = $165.

Now, we know that the total cost before the discount is $95 + $165 = $260.

Sophia paid a total of $1500 after a 20% discount. To find the original price before the discount, we divide by (1 - 0.20) = 0.80.
So, the original price was $1500 / 0.80 = $1875.

Now, we can find the cost of the mini cheesecakes by subtracting the cost of the donuts and cupcakes from the total cost.
The total cost of the mini cheesecakes is $1875 - $260 = $1615.

Since Sophia bought 60 mini cheesecakes, and there are 12 cheesecakes in a dozen, she bought:
60 / 12 = 5 dozen cheesecakes.

So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen is $1615 / 5 = $323.
The answer is $323.",323.0,1,,323.0,1
gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving. A 300 grams bag has 6 servings. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?",350.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the remaining daily calorie target for both Hiroshi and Tara, and then determine how many servings of popcorn each needs to consume to meet their targets. Finally, we can calculate the difference in the number of grams of popcorn each needs to consume.

1. Calculate the remaining daily calorie target for Hiroshi:
Hiroshi's weight is 220 lbs, and the healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. So, Hiroshi's daily calorie target is 220 x 15 = 3300 calories. He has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Therefore, his remaining calorie target is 3300 - 1100 - 200 = 2000 calories.

2. Calculate the remaining daily calorie target for Tara:
Tara's weight is 140 lbs, and the healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. So, Tara's daily calorie target is 140 x 15 = 2100 calories. She has already consumed 900 calories in food and 200 calories in ice cream. Therefore, her remaining calorie target is 2100 - 900 - 200 = 1000 calories.

3. Calculate the number of servings of popcorn each needs to consume:
A bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving. Hiroshi needs 2000 more calories, so he needs 2000 / 200 = 10 servings. Tara needs 1000 more calories, so she needs 1000 / 200 = 5 servings.

4. Calculate the number of grams of popcorn each needs to consume:
A 300 grams bag has 6 servings. Therefore, each serving is 300 / 6 = 50 grams. Hiroshi needs 10 servings, so he needs 10 x 50 = 500 grams of popcorn. Tara needs 5 servings, so she needs 5 x 50 = 250 grams of popcorn.

5. Calculate the difference in the number of grams of popcorn each needs to consume:
Hiroshi needs 500 grams of popcorn, and Tara needs 250 grams of popcorn. Therefore, Hiroshi needs 500 - 250 = 250 more grams of popcorn than Tara.

The final answer is 250.",250.0,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the daily calorie target for Hiroshi and Tara.

Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and the healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. So, Hiroshi's daily calorie target is 220 * 15 = 3300 calories.

Tara weighs 140 lbs, and the healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. So, Tara's daily calorie target is 140 * 15 = 2100 calories.

Hiroshi has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise, so he has a remaining calorie deficit of 3300 - (1100 + 200) = 1900 calories.

Tara has already consumed 900 calories and 200 calories in ice cream, so she has a remaining calorie deficit of 2100 - (900 + 200) = 1000 calories.

Since the bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving, and there are 6 servings in a 300 grams bag, we can calculate the number of calories in a 300 grams bag as 200 * 6 = 1200 calories.

To find out how many grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume, we can divide his remaining calorie deficit by the number of calories in a 300 grams bag: 1900 / 1200 = 1.5833 bags. Since we can't consume a fraction of a bag, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, so Hiroshi needs to consume 2 bags of popcorn.

To find out how many grams of popcorn Tara needs to consume, we can divide her remaining calorie deficit by the number of calories in a 300 grams bag: 1000 / 1200 = 0.8333 bags. Since we can't consume a fraction of a bag, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, so Tara needs to consume 1 bag of popcorn.

Now, let's find out how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara: 2 bags - 1 bag = 1 bag.

Since each bag is 300 grams, the answer is 300.",300.0,0,"I'll provide the corrected solution in the required format.

Let's think step by step.

Hiroshi's daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight.
He weighs 220 lbs, so his daily calorie target is 220 * 15 = 3300 calories.
He has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise.
So, he still needs 3300 - 1100 - 200 = 2000 calories.

Tara's daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight.
She weighs 140 lbs, so her daily calorie target is 140 * 15 = 2100 calories.
She has already consumed 900 calories and 200 calories in ice cream.
So, she still needs 2100 - 900 - 200 = 1000 calories.

The bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving, and there are 6 servings in a 300-gram bag.
So, each serving is 300 / 6 = 50 grams.

Hiroshi needs 2000 calories, and each serving of popcorn is 200 calories.
So, he needs 2000 / 200 = 10 servings of popcorn.
Since each serving is 50 grams, he needs 10 * 50 = 500 grams of popcorn.

Tara needs 1000 calories, and each serving of popcorn is 200 calories.
So, she needs 1000 / 200 = 5 servings of popcorn.
Since each serving is 50 grams, she needs 5 * 50 = 250 grams of popcorn.

To find out how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara, we subtract the amount Tara needs from the amount Hiroshi needs:
500 - 250 = 250.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of potted plants Daphne already has**

Daphne has 56 window ledges, and each ledge has 8 potted plants. To find the total number of potted plants she already has, we multiply the number of ledges by the number of plants per ledge:

56 ledges × 8 plants/ledge = 448 plants

Daphne received 23 new potted plants from the plant nursery 2 days ago.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of new potted plants Daphne purchased**

Daphne purchased 200 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount. To find the number of plants she actually purchased, we divide the original price by 0.5 (since it's a 50% discount):

200 plants × 0.5 = 100 plants

However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the speed of the fog bank. We know that it takes 60 minutes to cover 4 miles, so we can calculate the speed as follows:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 4 miles / 60 minutes
Speed = 1 mile / 15 minutes

However, we are also told that the wind speed will be halved in one hour. This means that the speed of the fog bank will be reduced by half after one hour. 

Since the speed is reduced by half after one hour, we can calculate the new speed as follows:

New Speed = Original Speed / 2
New Speed = (1 mile / 15 minutes) / 2
New Speed = 1 mile / 30 minutes

Now, we need to determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city. We know that the city is 80 miles across, so 1/4 of the city is:

1/4 of 80 miles = 20 miles

We can use the new speed to calculate the time it will take to cover 20 miles:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 20 miles / (1 mile / 30 minutes)
Time = 20 miles * 30 minutes / 1 mile
Time = 600 minutes

However, we are asked to find the time it will take to cover 1/4 of the city, not the entire city. Since the speed of the fog bank is reduced by half after one hour, we need to consider the time it will take to cover the first 20 miles at the original speed, and then the time it will take to cover the remaining 20 miles at the reduced speed.

Time to cover the first 20 miles = 20 miles / (1 mile / 15 minutes)
Time to cover the first 20 miles = 20 miles * 15 minutes / 1 mile
Time to cover the first 20 miles = 300 minutes

Time to cover the remaining 20 miles = 20 miles / (1 mile / 30 minutes)
Time to cover the remaining 20 miles = 20 miles * 30 minutes / 1 mile
Time to cover the remaining 20 miles = 600 minutes

Since the wind speed is halved after one hour, we need to add the time it takes to cover the first 20 miles at the original speed to the time it takes to cover the remaining 20 miles at the reduced speed. However, we are asked to find the time it will take to cover 1/4 of the city, not the entire city. 

Since the city is 80 miles across, and we are asked to find the time it will take to cover 1/4 of the city, we can simply divide the city in half and find the time it will take to cover half of the city at the reduced speed.

Time to cover half of the city = 40 miles / (1 mile / 30 minutes)
Time to cover half of the city = 40 miles * 30 minutes / 1 mile
Time to cover half of the city = 1200 minutes

However, this is the time it will take to cover half of the city, not 1/4 of the city. Since we are asked to find the time it will take to cover 1/4 of the city, we can simply divide the time it will take to cover half of the city by 2.

A: Let's think step by step.

The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes.
However, the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour, which means it will cover 4 miles in 120 minutes (since 60 minutes is halved to 30 minutes, and 4 miles takes 60 minutes at normal speed, so it will take 120 minutes at half speed).

The city is 80 miles across, and we want to find out how many minutes it will take to cover 1/4 of the city.
1/4 of the city is 80 / 4 = 20 miles.

Since the fog bank covers 4 miles in 120 minutes, we can find out how many minutes it will take to cover 20 miles:
20 miles / 4 miles per 120 minutes = 5 * 120 minutes = 600 minutes.

However, this is not the final answer. We need to consider the fact that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour, which means the fog bank will cover 4 miles in 120 minutes, not 60 minutes.

If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?",6.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, Santiago watched 4-hour episodes each night, so he watched 2 x 4 = 8 hours of TV on those two nights.

On Friday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. We need to convert the 45-minute show to hours, so 45 minutes is equal to 0.75 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, on Friday, he watched 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours of TV.

On Saturday, he watched three 2-hour episodes, so he watched 3 x 2 = 6 hours of TV.

On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes. We need to convert the 15-minute episodes to hours, so 15 minutes is equal to 0.25 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, on Sunday, he watched 3 x 0.25 = 0.75 hours of TV.

Now, let's add up the total hours of TV Santiago watched:

8 hours (Tuesday and Wednesday) + 3.75 hours (Friday) + 6 hours (Saturday) + 0.75 hours (Sunday) = 18.5 hours

However, we know that Santiago watched a total of 20 hours of TV. This means that the remaining 1.5 hours of TV must have been watched on Thursday.

On Thursday, Santiago watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes he watched ""x"". Since each episode is 15 minutes, or 0.25 hours, the total hours of TV he watched on Thursday is 0.25x.

We know that the total hours of TV he watched on Thursday is 1.5 hours, so we can set up the equation:

0.25x = 1.5

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.25:

x = 1.5 / 0.25
x = 6

So, Santiago watched 6 episodes of the 15-minute show on Thursday.",15.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's find the total number of hours Santiago watched on Tuesday and Wednesday.
He watched 4-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 hours.

Next, on Friday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. First, we convert 45 minutes into hours: 45 / 60 = 0.75 hours. 
So, the total number of hours on Friday is 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.

On Saturday, he watched three 2-hour episodes, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

On Sunday, he watched three 15-minute episodes. First, we convert 15 minutes into hours: 15 / 60 = 0.25 hours.
So, the total number of hours on Sunday is 3 * 0.25 = 0.75 hours.

We know that he watched 20 hours of TV in total. The total hours so far (before Thursday) is 8 + 3.75 + 6 + 0.75 = 18.5 hours.

To find the hours he watched on Thursday, we subtract 18.5 from the total hours: 20 - 18.5 = 1.5 hours.

She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,"To find out how many teaspoons of sugar Nia used, we first need to set up equations for the total number of teaspoons of sugar, tablespoons of milk, tablespoons of cream, and cups of water based on the given ratios. 

Let's start by setting up an equation for the total amount of each ingredient:

- Ratio of sugar to water is 54:27, but since the question includes tablespoons of milk and cream, we'll use the total amount as the base (240). So we'll set the total amount of the ratio to 240 and solve for the ratio. 
- The total ratio will be sugar : water = 54x : 27x, where x is a constant.
- The ratio of milk to water is 8:8 or 1:1. Since the ratio of sugar to water is 54:27, we can simplify it to 2:1. So, the milk to water ratio can be simplified to 2:1 as well. 
- The ratio of cream to sugar is 2:54, which can be simplified to 1:27.

Now we can set up the equations using the given total amount of 240.

1. Total number of teaspoons of sugar = 54x
2. Total number of cups of water = 27x
3. Total number of tablespoons of milk = 2 * 27x (since the ratio of milk to water is 2:1)
4. Total number of tablespoons of cream = 1 * 54x (since the ratio of cream to sugar is 1:54)

We know that the total amount of all ingredients is 240. So we can set up the equation as follows:
54x + 27x + (2 * 27x) + (1 * 54x) = 240
Combine the like terms:
54x + 27x + 54x + 54x = 240
Combine the coefficients of x:
189x = 240

Now divide by 189 to find the value of x:
x = 240 / 189
x = 1.27

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the total number of teaspoons of sugar:
Total number of teaspoons of sugar = 54x
= 54 * 1.27

She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's analyze the given ratio of sugar to water, which is 54:27. This means that for every 54 teaspoons of sugar, Nia uses 27 cups of water.

Next, we are given that Nia uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water. This means that the ratio of milk to water is 1:1.

We are also given that Nia uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. This means that the ratio of cream to sugar is 2:1.

Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar used as x. Then, the number of cups of water used is 27x/54, the number of tablespoons of milk used is 8 * (27x/54), and the number of tablespoons of heavy cream used is 2x.

The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk used is 240. We can set up the following equation:

x + (27x/54) + (8 * (27x/54)) + 2x = 240

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 54 to eliminate the fractions:

54x + 27x + 216x + 108x = 12960

Combine like terms:

405x = 12960

Divide both sides by 405:

x = 32

So, Nia used 32 teaspoons of sugar.

The answer is 32.",32.0,0,"I'll provide the corrected reasoning and answer.

Q: Nia makes tea using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 54:27. She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, and uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of cups of water used. Since the ratio of sugar to water is 54:27, we can let the number of cups of water be 27x and the number of teaspoons of sugar be 54x.

We know that for every 8 cups of water, 8 tablespoons of milk are used. So, the total number of tablespoons of milk used is 8 * (27x / 8) = 27x.

We also know that for every teaspoon of sugar, 2 tablespoons of heavy cream are used. So, the total number of tablespoons of heavy cream used is 2 * 54x = 108x.

The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk used is 240. We can set up the equation:

54x + 27x + 27x + 108x = 240

Combine like terms:

216x = 240

Divide by 216:

x = 240 / 216
x = 1.111

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar used:

Number of teaspoons of sugar = 54x
= 54 * 1.111
= 60

However, this is not the correct answer. Let's re-examine the problem.

We know that the ratio of sugar to water is 54:27, so the number of cups of water is 27x and the number of teaspoons of sugar is 54x.

We also know that for every 8 cups of water, 8 tablespoons of milk are used. So, the total number of tablespoons of milk used is 8 * (27x / 8) = 27x.

We also know that for every teaspoon of sugar, 2 tablespoons of heavy cream are used. So, the total number of tablespoons of heavy cream used is 2 * 54x = 108x.

The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk used is 240. We can set up the equation:

54x + 27x + 27x + 108x = 240

Combine like terms:

216x = 240

Divide by 216:

x = 240 / 216
x = 1.111

However, we made a mistake in our previous calculation. Let's re-calculate the total number of tablespoons of milk and heavy cream used:

Number of tablespoons of milk = 8 * (27x / 8) = 27x
Number of tablespoons of heavy cream = 2 * 54x = 108x

The total number of tablespoons of milk and heavy cream used is 27x + 108x = 135x.

The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk used is 240. We can set up the equation:

54x + 27x + 135x = 240

Combine like terms:

216x = 240

Divide by 216:

x = 240 / 216
x = 1.111

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar used:

She noticed that she was out of plastic forks, so she bought a new package of forks. Later, her husband also bought a package of 8 new forks and gave them to Aisha. While Aisha was making the stuffed peppers, she used sixteen of the forks to sample her stuffed peppers, then threw away 6 defective forks. The guests also brought 2 packs of forks, each having 6 inside them. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 32 forks. How many forks were in the package that Aisha bought?",34.0,"To find out how many forks were in the package that Aisha bought, let's break down the information given.

Initially, Aisha's husband gave her 8 forks. 

She used 16 forks and threw away 6, so she was left with 16 - 6 = 10 forks from the initial purchase. 

The guests brought 2 packs of forks, each with 6 forks, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 additional forks.

Now, Aisha has a total of 32 forks, and we already know that she has 10 forks (from the initial purchase) and 12 forks (from the guests). 

Let x be the number of forks in the package that Aisha bought. 

We can set up the equation: 
x + 8 + 10 + 12 = 32

Combining the constants, we get:
x + 30 = 32

Now, we subtract 30 from both sides:
x = 32 - 30
x = 2

However, it seems too low for a standard package of forks to contain only 2 forks. Let's reevaluate the equation. 

If we combine 10 and 12, we get:
10 + 12 = 22

Now, adding Aisha's husband's 8 forks and x (the initial purchase):
22 + 8 + x = 32

Combining the constants, we get:
30 + x = 32

Now, we subtract 30 from both sides:
x = 2

Still, we have the same issue as before. Let's reevaluate the problem again.

Since Aisha used 16 forks, her husband gave her 8 forks, and she threw away 6, we still know that she has 10 forks from the initial purchase.

Now let's focus on the guests. They brought 2 packs of forks, each with 6 forks, which means they brought 12 forks, leaving us with 10 forks from the initial purchase, 8 forks from Aisha's husband, and the 12 forks from the guests.

So the total number of forks before Aisha's initial purchase is:
10 + 8 + 12 = 30

Now, we know that this total is not the only part, since Aisha has 32 forks in total.
We know she bought x forks, and the total is 32 forks.

We can set up the equation: 
30 + x = 32

Now, we subtract 30 from both sides:
x = 32 - 30
x = 2

However, it seems too low for a standard package of forks to contain only 2 forks. Let's break down the problem again.

Let's find the number of forks that Aisha used or threw away after the guests arrived. She used 16 forks and threw away 6, leaving her 10 forks from the initial purchase. The guests added 12 forks. 
Aisha's husband added 8 forks. 

x + 8 + 10 + 12 = 32

Combine 10 and 12:
22 + 8 + x = 32

Combine the constants:
30 + x = 32

Subtract 30 from both sides:
x = 2

As before, we have the issue of a standard package of forks containing only 2 forks. Let's try another approach.

Aisha's husband added 8 forks, the guests added 12 forks, and she had 10 forks from the initial purchase. The total before the initial purchase is 10 + 8 + 12 = 30.

We know Aisha has 32 forks in total.
We can set up the equation: 
30 + x = 32

Now, we subtract 30 from both sides:
x = 32 - 30
x = 2

However, this still seems too low for a standard package of forks. Let's examine the problem again.

Aisha used 16 forks and threw away 6. This means she had 10 forks from the initial purchase. 

The guests added 12 forks.
Aisha's husband added 8 forks.

So the total before the initial purchase is 10 + 8 + 12 = 30 forks.

The total forks Aisha has is 32 forks.

In addition, Ravi owns a 13-square yard apricot field that produces 12 apricots per square yard. The apricots can be harvested every 4 months. In the span of two years, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?",1764.0,"## Step 1: Calculate the number of bananas Ravi can harvest from his banana field in one year.
First, we need to find out how many bananas Ravi can harvest from his banana field in one year. Since he has 10 square yards of banana field and there are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard, we need to calculate the total number of bananas per square yard first. 36 bananas / (4/5) = 36 * (5/4) = 45 bananas per square yard. Then, we multiply the number of bananas per square yard by the total number of square yards to get the total number of bananas per year. 45 bananas/square yard * 10 square yards = 450 bananas/year.

## Step 2: Calculate the number of bananas Ravi can harvest from his banana field in two years.
Since Ravi can harvest his bananas every 4 months, he can harvest twice a year. So, the total number of bananas he can harvest in two years is 450 bananas/year * 2 years = 900 bananas.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of apricots Ravi can harvest from his apricot field in one year.
Ravi has a 13-square yard apricot field that produces 12 apricots per square yard. So, the total number of apricots per year is 12 apricots/square yard * 13 square yards = 156 apricots/year.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of apricots Ravi can harvest from his apricot field in two years.
Since Ravi can harvest his apricots every 4 months, he can harvest twice a year. So, the total number of apricots he can harvest in two years is 156 apricots/year * 2 years = 312 apricots.

## Step 5: Calculate the difference between the number of bananas and apricots Ravi harvests in two years.
To find the difference, we subtract the number of apricots from the number of bananas. 900 bananas - 312 apricots = 588.

The final answer is: $\boxed{588}$",588.0,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field. He can harvest bananas every 4 months.

First, let's find out how many bananas Ravi can harvest per square yard. It is given that there are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard. 

To find the number of bananas per square yard, we need to multiply 36 by 5/4 (since 4/5 of a square yard is 5/4 of the total number of bananas per square yard).

So, the number of bananas per square yard is 36 * (5/4) = 45.

Now, let's find out how many bananas Ravi can harvest per year. Since Ravi can harvest bananas every 4 months, he can harvest bananas 3 times a year (12 months / 4 months = 3).

The total number of bananas Ravi can harvest per year is 10 * 45 * 3 = 1350.

Ravi also owns a 13-square yard apricot field that produces 12 apricots per square yard. 

The total number of apricots Ravi can harvest per year is 13 * 12 * 3 = 468.

Now, let's find out how many more bananas Ravi harvests than apricots in two years.

He bought 12 folders which cost $4.75 each, 8 erasers which cost $14.5 each, and a ream of bond paper which cost $11. He also bought 7 pencils which cost $8 each. Arjun can either pay a one-time $20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases, or not become a member and receive only a 5% discount. What is the least amount Arjun can spend on everything?",212.0,"To find the least amount Arjun can spend, we need to calculate the total cost of the items first and then compare the costs with and without the membership.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of each item**

1. 12 folders at $4.75 each: 
   Total cost of folders = 12 * 4.75 = $57

2. 8 erasers at $14.5 each: 
   Total cost of erasers = 8 * 14.5 = $116

3. 1 ream of bond paper at $11
   Total cost of bond paper = $11

4. 7 pencils at $8 each:
   Total cost of pencils = 7 * 8 = $56

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of items without membership**

Total cost without membership = Total cost of folders + Total cost of erasers + Total cost of bond paper + Total cost of pencils
Total cost without membership = $57 + $116 + $11 + $56
Total cost without membership = $240

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost with membership (20% discount)**

First, find the total cost of all items before discount:
Total cost before discount = $57 + $116 + $11 + $56 = $240

Next, calculate the discount:
Discount = 20% of the total cost before discount
Discount = 0.2 * $240 = $48

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost before discount:
Total cost with membership = Total cost before discount - Discount
Total cost with membership = $240 - $48 = $192

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost with membership (considering the $20 membership fee)**

Total cost with membership = Total cost with membership + Membership fee
Total cost with membership = $192 + $20
Total cost with membership = $212

**Step 5: Compare the costs without and with membership**

Without membership: $240
With membership: $212

The least amount Arjun can spend on everything is $212 by becoming a member and getting a 20% discount.",20.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Arjun bought:

1. Folders: 12 folders at $4.75 each
   So, the total cost of folders is 12 * 4.75 = $57

2. Erasers: 8 erasers at $14.5 each
   So, the total cost of erasers is 8 * 14.5 = $116

3. Ream of bond paper: $11
   The cost of the ream of bond paper is $11.

4. Pencils: 7 pencils at $8 each
   So, the total cost of pencils is 7 * 8 = $56

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items:
Total cost = $57 + $116 + $11 + $56 = $240

If Arjun becomes a member and gets a 20% discount on all purchases, the discount amount is:
Discount = 20% of $240 = 0.20 * $240 = $48

So, the total amount Arjun needs to pay if he becomes a member is:
$240 - $48 = $192

If Arjun does not become a member and gets a 5% discount on all purchases, the discount amount is:
Discount = 5% of $240 = 0.05 * $240 = $12

So, the total amount Arjun needs to pay if he does not become a member is:
$240 - $12 = $228

The least amount Arjun can spend on everything is $192.",192.0,0,"Let's break it down step by step.

Arjun has two options: become a member and get a 20% discount, or not become a member and get a 5% discount.

**Option 1: Become a member**

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before any discount:
- 12 folders at $4.75 each: 12 * $4.75 = $57
- 8 erasers at $14.5 each: 8 * $14.5 = $116
- 1 ream of bond paper at $11
- 7 pencils at $8 each: 7 * $8 = $56

The total cost of the items is $57 + $116 + $11 + $56 = $240
Arjun will also pay a one-time $20 fee to become a member.

So, the total cost after the 20% discount is 0.8 * $260 = $208
The answer is $208.

**Option 2: Not become a member**

The total cost of the items is the same as in Option 1: $240
The 5% discount is 0.05 * $240 = $12

So, the total cost after the 5% discount is $240 - $12 = $228

Since $208 (Option 1) is less than $228 (Option 2), the least amount Arjun can spend on everything is $208.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row, than that he rolls four even numbers in a row?",50.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of each event and then find the difference in percentage points.

Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row
The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a 20-sided die is 10/20 = 1/2.
Since the die is rolled twice, we need to multiply the probability by itself:
(1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4

Event 2: Rolling four even numbers in a row
The probability of rolling an even number on a 20-sided die is 10/20 = 1/2.
Since the die is rolled four times, we need to multiply the probability by itself four times:
(1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/16

Now, we need to find the difference in percentage points between the two probabilities:
(1/4 - 1/16) = 3/16
To convert this to a percentage, we can multiply by 100:
(3/16) × 100 = 18.75%

So, Yusuf is 18.75% more likely to roll a number greater than 5 twice in a row than to roll four even numbers in a row.",5.0,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row and the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between these two probabilities.

Let's start by calculating the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row.

There are 10 numbers greater than 5 on a 20-sided die (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20). The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a single roll is 10/20 = 1/2.

Since Yusuf is rolling the die twice in a row, we need to multiply the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on the first roll by the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on the second roll:

(1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is 1/4.

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row.

There are 10 even numbers on a 20-sided die (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20). The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 10/20 = 1/2.

Since Yusuf is rolling the die four times in a row, we need to multiply the probability of rolling an even number on each roll:

(1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/16

So, the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is 1/16.

Now, let's find the difference between these two probabilities:

(1/4) - (1/16) = 3/16

To express this difference as a percentage, we can multiply by 100:

(3/16) × 100 = 18.75%

So, it is 18.75% more likely that Yusuf rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row than that he rolls four even numbers in a row.

The answer is 18.75%.",18.75,0,"I'll provide the correct answer with step-by-step reasoning.

A twenty-sided die has 20 sides, with numbers 1 through 20. To roll a number greater than 5 twice in a row, the first roll must be 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20, and the second roll must be one of the remaining 10 numbers. 

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on the first roll is 15/20, or 75%. 
The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on the second roll, given that the first roll was greater than 5, is 10/20, or 50%. 

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is (15/20) * (10/20) = 0.1875.

To roll four even numbers in a row, the first roll must be an even number, the second roll must be an even number, the third roll must be an even number, and the fourth roll must be an even number.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 10/20, or 50%.
The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll, given that the first roll was even, is 10/20, or 50%.
The probability of rolling an even number on the third roll, given that the first two rolls were even, is 10/20, or 50%.
The probability of rolling an even number on the fourth roll, given that the first three rolls were even, is 10/20, or 50%.

So, the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is (10/20) * (10/20) * (10/20) * (10/20) = 0.0625.

The difference in probability is 0.1875 - 0.0625 = 0.125.

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.125 * 100 = 12.5.

Mia then found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. In addition, she saw 24 wasps, and 9 bees. What percentage of animals in the plot were rabbits?",20.0,"To find the percentage of animals that were rabbits, we first need to calculate the total number of animals and the number of rabbits. 

Let's start with the information given:

- The number of beetles is 2/3 as many as bees. If we assume the number of bees is B, then the number of beetles is 2/3B.
- The total number of white animals (beetles and rabbits) is 26. Since half of these were rabbits, the number of rabbits is 26/2 = 13.
- Since the total number of beetles and rabbits is 26, we can set up an equation: 2/3B + 13 = 26.

Solving for B:
2/3B + 13 = 26
2/3B = 26 - 13
2/3B = 13
B = 13 * 3/2
B = 19.5

Now that we know the number of bees, we can find the number of beetles:
Number of beetles = 2/3B = 2/3 * 19.5 = 13.

Now, let's find the total number of insects (bees, wasps, and beetles):
Total number of insects = Number of bees + Number of wasps + Number of beetles
Total number of insects = 9 + 24 + 13 = 46

Now, let's find the total number of animals (white and non-white):
Total number of white animals (rabbits) is 13, and the total number of non-white animals is unknown.
However, for this problem, we only consider the insects.
Since we only have information on insects, we will use this as the total number of animals for now.

Now, we can find the percentage of animals that were rabbits:
Percentage of rabbits = (Number of rabbits / Total number of animals) * 100
Since we only have information on insects, we will use this as the total number of animals.
However, for the sake of this problem, we will consider the original given information which stated that there were 26 white animals in total.
So, the correct total number of animals would be the sum of white and non-white animals.
However, we can solve the problem considering the given information about the white animals, we know that 13 of them are rabbits, and there were 26 in total, which means 26 - 13 = 13 are non-white.
We can make a list of all the animals that are white and the ones that are not white,
1) White animals:
   - Rabbits: 13
   - Beetle: 13

2) Non-White animals:
   - Wasps: 24
   - Bees: 9

Total white animals = 13 + 13 = 26
Total non-white animals = 24 + 9 = 33
Total number of animals = 26 + 33 = 59

Now, we can find the percentage of animals that were rabbits:
Percentage of rabbits = (Number of rabbits / Total number of animals) * 100
= (13 / 59) * 100

So, the percentage of animals in the plot that were rabbits is 22.03%.",22.03,0,"I'll follow the format you provided to solve the problem step by step.

Let's break down the problem:

Mia found 2/3 as many beetles as bees. Since she saw 9 bees, the number of beetles is 2/3 * 9 = 6.

Mia found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. So, the number of rabbits is 26 / 2 = 13.

She also saw 24 wasps and 9 bees. To find the total number of non-rabbit, non-bee, non-wasp animals, we need to add the number of beetles and the number of other white animals that are not rabbits. Since there are 26 white animals in total and 13 of them are rabbits, the number of other white animals is 26 - 13 = 13. However, this includes the 9 bees, so we need to subtract the bees from this number to get the number of other white animals that are not bees or rabbits. The number of other white animals that are not bees or rabbits is 13 - 9 = 4.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals: 9 bees + 6 beetles + 24 wasps + 13 rabbits + 4 other white animals = 56.

To find the percentage of animals that are rabbits, we need to divide the number of rabbits by the total number of animals and multiply by 100. The percentage of animals that are rabbits is (13 / 56) * 100 = 23.21%.

1. First, let's find the selling price with a 25% discount:
   Selling price = $400000
   Discount = 25% of $400000 = 0.25 * $400000 = $100000
   Selling price after discount = $400000 - $100000 = $300000

2. Now, let's calculate the brokerage fee (5% of the selling price after discount):
   Brokerage fee = 5% of $300000 = 0.05 * $300000 = $15000

3. Then, let's calculate the transfer fee (12% of the selling price after discount):

Mrs. Lee's budget is $340,000.

The selling price of the property is $400,000. However, Mrs. Lee can get a 25% discount on the selling price. 

25% of $400,000 is 0.25 * 400,000 = $100,000. So, the discounted selling price is $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * 400,000 = $20,000.

1. Calculate the legal fees:
   The legal fees are 2% of the selling price, which is $550000. 
   So, the legal fees = 2% of $550000 = 0.02 * $550000 = $11000.

2. Calculate the realtor fee:
   The realtor fee is 5% of the selling price, which is $550000. 
   So, the realtor fee = 5% of $550000 = 0.05 * $550000 = $27500.

3. Calculate the total fees:
   The total fees = legal fees + realtor fee = $11000 + $27500 = $38500.

4. Calculate the remaining amount after paying fees:
   The remaining amount = selling price - total fees = $550000 - $38500 = $511500.

5. Calculate the remaining loan amount:
   The remaining loan amount = $440000.

6. Calculate the net proceeds after paying the remaining loan amount:
   The net proceeds = remaining amount - remaining loan amount = $511500 - $440000 = $71500.

7. Calculate the net proceeds after two years:
   The stocks gained 10% each year for two years.

Dr. Brown's villa was sold for $550,000.

1. He paid the legal fees, which is 2% of the selling price.
2% of $550,000 is 0.02 x $550,000 = $11,000. So, he spent $11,000 on legal fees.

The selling price minus the legal fees is $550,000 - $11,000 = $539,000.

3. He also paid a realtor fee, which is 5% of the selling price.
5% of $550,000 is 0.05 x $550,000 = $27,500. So, he spent $27,500 on a realtor fee.

The selling price minus the legal fees and realtor fee is $539,000 - $27,500 = $511,500.

Let's start by finding the number of boys in the park. We are told that there are one-fourth the number of boys as girls. Since there are 16 girls, we can multiply 16 by 1/4 to find the number of boys:

16 x 1/4 = 16/4 = 4

So, there are 4 boys in the park.

Now, we can find the total number of kids in the park by adding the number of girls and boys:

Total number of kids = 16 (girls) + 4 (boys) = 20

Now, we can find the percentage of kids who are girls by dividing the number of girls by the total number of kids and multiplying by 100:

How much money does Priya have left?

A: Let's think step by step.

Priya starts with ₺1200.

She buys 15 kgs of fudge at ₺22 per kg. The total cost for the 15 kgs is 15 * ₺22 = ₺330.

She also buys 4 kgs of fudge at 1/4 off. The original price for 4 kgs would be 4 * ₺22 = ₺88. But since it's 1/4 off, she pays 3/4 of the original price, which is ₺88 * 3/4 = ₺66.

The total cost for the fudge is ₺330 + ₺66 = ₺396.

She also buys a mixed bag of sand dollars for ₺11.0 and 12 postcards for ₺21.0 each. The total cost for the postcards is 12 * ₺21 = ₺252.

The total cost for all the items is ₺396 + ₺11 + ₺252 = ₺659.

First, we calculate the discount: 1/4 of 4 kgs is 4 * 1/4 = 1 kg. 
So, the discount is 1 kg * ₺22 = ₺22.
Now, subtract the discount from the original 4 kgs: 4 - 1 = 3 kgs at full price.
Then, the discount amount is subtracted from the total cost of 4 kgs: ₺22.

What percentage of all the puppies have spots?",90.0,"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to calculate the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of puppies.

Jamal's dog has 131 puppies.
Gabriel's dog has 47 puppies.
Yuki has 54 dogs, each having 13 puppies with spots. However, we are not told the total number of puppies Yuki has, we are only given the number of puppies with spots. 

Since we are not given the total number of puppies Yuki has, we can express Yuki's total puppies in terms of the puppies with spots. We know that the total puppies Yuki has is 54 * 13 (the number of puppies per dog) / 1 (one dog) = 702 puppies with spots. However, we want the total number of puppies Yuki has. To find that, we will divide 702 by 13 to find the total number of dogs Yuki has, which is indeed 54. Now we can multiply 54 by 13 to get 702. Then multiply 702 by 12 (the number of puppies per dog in total) to get the total number of puppies Yuki has which is 8428.

Now we can find the total number of puppies: 
131 (Jamal's puppies) + 47 (Gabriel's puppies) + 8428 (Yuki's puppies) = 8506.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of puppies with spots.

Jamal's spotted puppies are 23, and half of his unspotted puppies have spots. So, the total spotted puppies in Jamal's dog are 23 + 23/2 = 23 + 11.5 = 34.5

Gabriel's spotted puppies are 13.

Yuki's spotted puppies are 13 * 54 = 702.

Now, we can calculate the total number of puppies with spots: 
23 (Jamal's puppies) + 13 (Gabriel's puppies) + 702 (Yuki's puppies) = 738.

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of puppies with spots.

The total number of puppies is 8506, and the total number of puppies with spots is 738. 

We can calculate the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies, then multiplying by 100:
(738 / 8506) * 100 = 8.69.

Rounded to two decimal places, the percentage of puppies with spots is 8.69%.",8.69,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

First, let's find the total number of puppies with spots from Jamal's and Gabriel's dogs.

Jamal's dog has 23 puppies with spots out of 131 puppies.
Gabriel's dog has 13 puppies with spots out of 47 puppies.

Let's calculate the number of puppies with spots for each dog:
Jamal's dog: 23 / 131 = 0.176 (approximately)
Gabriel's dog: 13 / 47 = 0.277 (approximately)

Now, let's find the total number of puppies with spots:
Total puppies with spots = (23 + 13) = 36

Next, let's find the total number of puppies from all the sources:
Jamal's dog: 131 puppies
Gabriel's dog: 47 puppies
Yuki's dogs: 54 dogs * 13 puppies/dog = 702 puppies

Total puppies = 131 + 47 + 702 = 880 puppies

Now, let's find the number of puppies that Jamal discovered to have spots after the vet visit.
Jamal's unspotted puppies = 131 - 23 = 108 puppies
Half of these puppies have spots: 108 / 2 = 54 puppies

Now, let's add the puppies with spots from all the sources:
Total puppies with spots = 36 + 54 = 90

Finally, let's calculate the percentage of puppies with spots:

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's find the total number of puppies:
Jamal's dog has 131 puppies.
Gabriel's dog has 47 puppies.
Yuki has 54 dogs, each having 13 puppies with spots, so Yuki has 54 * 13 = 702 puppies.
However, we are only interested in the total number of puppies, not the number of spotted puppies. So, we add the number of puppies from Jamal and Gabriel, and the total number of puppies from Yuki: 131 + 47 + 702 = 880 puppies.

Next, let's find the number of puppies with spots:
Jamal's dog has 23 puppies with spots.
Gabriel's dog has 13 puppies with spots.
Yuki has 54 dogs, each having 13 puppies with spots, so Yuki has 54 * 13 = 702 puppies with spots.
So, the total number of puppies with spots is 23 + 13 + 702 = 738 puppies.

Now, let's find the number of unspotted puppies:
The total number of puppies is 880.
The number of puppies with spots is 738.
So, the number of unspotted puppies is 880 - 738 = 142 puppies.

After the vet visit, half of the unspotted puppies are found to have spots:
The number of unspotted puppies is 142.
Half of them have spots, so the number of puppies that were previously unspotted but now have spots is 142 / 2 = 71 puppies.

Now, let's find the total number of puppies with spots:
The number of puppies with spots initially is 738.
71 more puppies are found to have spots.
So, the total number of puppies with spots is 738 + 71 = 809 puppies.

Finally, let's find the percentage of puppies with spots:

The total almonds that can be held by the 3 tables is 72 * 3 = 216 almonds.

Now, let's find the total almonds that can be held by the 7 bowls and 3 tables together. 
7 bowls can hold 24 * 7 = 168 almonds.
3 tables can hold 216 almonds.
So, the total almonds that can be held by both is 168 + 216 = 384 almonds.

Now, we know Carlos has 720 almonds to start. 

Since 2 tables break, he will be left with 2 tables that can hold 72 * 2 = 144 almonds.

Carlos has 720 almonds and eats one-fifth of them, which is 720 / 5 = 144 almonds.
So, the number of almonds left is 720 - 144 = 576 almonds.

Since the total number of almonds that can be placed on the tables and bowls is 72 + 168 = 240 almonds, and there are 576 almonds left, Carlos needs more bowls to place all the remaining almonds.

Let's find out how many more bowls Carlos needs:
The total number of almonds that can be placed on the bowls is 24 times the number of bowls.
Let's say the number of bowls needed is x.
Then, 24x = 576 - 240 = 336 almonds.

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides by 24:
x = 336 / 24
x = 14

So, Carlos needs 14 - 7 = 7 more bowls.

Diego is currently 19 years old. In 9 years, he will be 19 + 9 = 28 years old.

Aisha will be 2 times as old as Diego is now, so in 9 years, she will be 2 * 19 = 38 years old.

Esteban is 6 years younger than Diego, so he is currently 19 - 6 = 13 years old. In 4 years, he will be 13 + 4 = 17 years old.

Keisha wants to make two warm jackets for herself, each needing 8 skeins of wool. Each dozen skeins of wool costs $7. The store has a promotion where customers receive a $20 discount on purchases over $100. How much should Keisha pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?",85.0,"To find out how much Keisha should pay for all the skeins of wool she needs, we need to calculate the total number of skeins required and then multiply it by the cost per dozen skeins.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of skeins required for the quadruplets**

For each grandchild, Keisha needs to make:
- 1 shawl (5 skeins)
- 1 sweater (6 skeins)
- 1 poncho (8 skeins)
- 1 pair of gloves (8 skeins)
- 1 pair of mittens (14 skeins)

Total skeins per grandchild = 5 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 14 = 41 skeins

Since there are 4 grandchildren, the total number of skeins required for all of them is:
41 skeins/grandchild * 4 grandchildren = 164 skeins

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of skeins required for Keisha's warm jackets**

Keisha wants to make 2 warm jackets, each needing 8 skeins of wool:
2 jackets * 8 skeins/jacket = 16 skeins

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of skeins required**

Total skeins required for the quadruplets = 164 skeins
Total skeins required for Keisha's jackets = 16 skeins
Total skeins required = 164 + 16 = 180 skeins

**Step 4: Calculate the number of dozen skeins required**

Since each dozen skeins costs $7, we need to find out how many dozen skeins Keisha needs to buy:
180 skeins / 12 skeins/dozen = 15 dozen skeins

**Step 5: Calculate the total cost before the discount**

15 dozen skeins * $7/dozen = $105

**Step 6: Apply the $20 discount**

Since the total cost before the discount is $105, which is over $100, Keisha will receive a $20 discount:
$105 - $20 = $85

Therefore, Keisha should pay $85 for all the skeins of wool she needs.",85.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Keisha needs to buy wool for her 4 grandchildren and herself. She needs to make a shawl, sweater, poncho, gloves, and mittens for each grandchild and a shawl for herself.
For each grandchild, she needs: 
- 5 skeins for a shawl
- 6 skeins for a sweater
- 8 skeins for a poncho
- 8 skeins for a pair of gloves
- 14 skeins for a pair of mittens
So, the total number of skeins for each grandchild is 5 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 14 = 41 skeins.
Since she has 4 grandchildren, the total number of skeins for all grandchildren is 41 * 4 = 164 skeins.
For herself, she needs 2 shawls, each requiring 5 skeins. So, she needs 5 * 2 = 10 skeins.

In total, Keisha needs 164 + 10 = 174 skeins of wool.

Each dozen skeins of wool costs $7. To find out how many dozens she needs, we divide 174 by 12.
174 / 12 = 14.5
Since you can't buy a fraction of a dozen, she will need 15 dozen skeins (14 dozen for 168 skeins and 6 extra skeins) but it's cheaper to just buy the 15 dozen skeins. This will cost 15 * 7 = $105.

However, the store has a promotion where customers receive a $20 discount on purchases over $100.
Keisha's total cost is $105, but first, it is more than $100, so she is eligible for the discount.

How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much rice Mohammed needs for a week. He uses 3 kgs of rice per day, so for a week (7 days), he needs:
   3 kgs/day * 7 days = 21 kgs

2. The normal brand of rice costs ¥15 per kg. However, his favorite brand is sold out, and he has to buy the more expensive brand which costs 20% more. The price of the more expensive brand is:
   15 + (15 * 0.2) = 15 + 3 = ¥18 per kg

3. Since there's a 40% discount on rice up to 10 kgs, Mohammed will pay the discounted price for the first 10 kgs, and the regular price for the remaining 11 kgs.
   Discounted price per kg = 18 - (18 * 0.4) = 18 - 7.2 = ¥10.8 per kg
   Cost for the first 10 kgs = 10.8 * 10 = ¥108
   Cost for the remaining 11 kgs (at the regular price) = 18 * 11 = ¥198
   Total cost of rice = 108 + 198 = ¥306

   Total cost of rice + cost of bagel = 306 + 2 = ¥308",308.0,1,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Mohammed needs to buy a week's worth of rice, which is 7 days. He uses 3 kgs of rice per day, so he needs a total of 7 * 3 = 21 kgs of rice.

The normal brand of rice costs ¥15 per kg. However, his favorite brand was sold out, and he has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more. So, the price of the more expensive brand is 15 + (20% of 15) = 15 + 3 = ¥18 per kg.

Mohammed needs 21 kgs of rice, and the first 10 kgs are eligible for a 40% discount. The discount amount is 40% of ¥18 per kg, which is 0.4 * 18 = ¥7.20 per kg. So, the price of the first 10 kgs is 18 - 7.20 = ¥10.80 per kg.

The total cost of the first 10 kgs is 10 * 10.80 = ¥108.

For the remaining 11 kgs, Mohammed has to pay the regular price of ¥18 per kg. The total cost of the remaining 11 kgs is 11 * 18 = ¥198.

The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,"## Step 1: Calculate the total number of signatures Jasmine and Mia have collected so far.
Jasmine has 36 signatures and Mia has 31 signatures, so together they have 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

## Step 2: Determine the total number of signatures Jasmine and Mia need to collect in the remaining 2 weeks to reach their goal.
They want to reach a total of 145 signatures by the end of the break, and they already have 67 signatures, so they need to collect 145 - 67 = 78 signatures in the remaining 2 weeks.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks.
Jasmine will only collect signatures on weekends, which is 2 days a week, and she will reduce her weekly collection by 5 signatures. So, in the first week, she will collect 36 - 5 = 31 signatures, and in the second week, she will collect 31 - 5 = 26 signatures. In total, Jasmine will collect 31 + 26 = 57 signatures in the remaining 2 weeks.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of signatures Mia needs to collect in the remaining 2 weeks.
Since Jasmine will collect 57 signatures in the remaining 2 weeks, and they need to collect a total of 78 signatures, Mia will need to collect 78 - 57 = 21 signatures in the remaining 2 weeks.

## Step 5: Calculate the number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week.
Mia needs to collect 21 signatures in 2 weeks, so she needs to collect 21 / 2 = 10.5 signatures per week.

## Step 6: Since Mia cannot collect a fraction of a signature, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure she meets the goal.
However, in this case, we are looking for the exact number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week to meet the goal, and since the problem does not specify that she can only collect whole numbers, we will leave the answer as a decimal.

Jasmine will collect signatures on weekends only, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to reach their goal?

A: Let's think step by step.
Jasmine and Mia currently have 67 signatures.
They want to reach a total of 145 signatures.
So, they need to collect 145 - 67 = 78 more signatures in 2 weeks.
Since Jasmine will collect signatures on weekends only, her weekly collection will be reduced by 5 per week. Let's assume she collects x signatures per weekend. Then, her weekly collection will be 2x - 5.
Mia will collect signatures 5 days a week, so her weekly collection will be y.
The total number of signatures collected in 2 weeks is (2x - 5) + 5y = 78.
Since there are 2 weeks, the total number of signatures collected is 2 * ((2x - 5) + 5y) = 78.
Simplifying the equation, we get 4x + 10y - 10 = 78.
Rearranging the equation, we get 4x + 10y = 88.
We want to find the value of y, which is Mia's weekly collection.
To do this, we need to find the value of x, which is Jasmine's weekly collection.
Since Jasmine collects signatures on weekends only, her weekly collection is 2x - 5.
We know that Jasmine's total collection over 2 weeks is 78 - 5y.
Since Jasmine collects signatures on weekends only, her total collection over 2 weeks is 2(2x - 5).
Equating the two expressions, we get 2(2x - 5) = 78 - 5y.
Simplifying the equation, we get 4x - 10 = 78 - 5y.
Rearranging the equation, we get 4x - 78 = 5y - 10.
Substituting x = (78 + 10) / 4 = 22 into the equation, we get 4(22) - 78 = 5y - 10.
Simplifying the equation, we get 88 - 78 = 5y - 10.
Rearranging the equation, we get 10 = 5y - 10.
Adding 10 to both sides, we get 20 = 5y.
Dividing both sides by 5, we get y = 4.

How many ounces of water does Leon have left?",122.0,"To find out how many ounces of water Leon has left, we need to calculate how many ounces he used to make the ice cubes.

Let's start by calculating the total ounces used for each type of cube:

1. Giant cubes: 10 cubes x 12 ounces/cube = 120 ounces
2. Medium cubes: 12 cubes x 5 ounces/cube = 60 ounces
3. Small cubes: 14 cubes x 0.5 ounces/cube = 7 ounces

Now, let's find out how many tiny cubes Leon made. We know that he made a total of 48 cubes, and we already know that 10 + 14 + 12 = 36 cubes are not tiny. So, the number of tiny cubes is:

48 (total cubes) - 36 (non-tiny cubes) = 12 tiny cubes

Since tiny cubes are half the size of small cubes, each tiny cube uses 0.25 ounces (half of 0.5 ounces).

Now, let's calculate the total ounces used for tiny cubes:

First, we need to find out how many ounces of water Leon used to make the giant cubes.
He made 10 giant cubes, each using 12 ounces.
So, the total number of ounces used for giant cubes is 10 * 12 = 120.

Next, we need to find out how many ounces of water Leon used to make the medium cubes.
He made 12 medium cubes, each using 5 ounces.
So, the total number of ounces used for medium cubes is 12 * 5 = 60.

Now, let's calculate the total number of ounces used for small cubes.
He made 14 small cubes, each using 1/2 ounce.
So, the total number of ounces used for small cubes is 14 * 0.5 = 7.

We are given that the tiny cubes are half the size of small cubes, so each tiny cube uses 0.25 ounces.

We know that Leon made a total of 48 ice cubes, and we already know the number of giant, medium, and small cubes he made.

His friends have chipped in and will cover the cost of all the food for the workshop. Oliver has also applied for help from the local charity, which has decided to cover 1/10 of the remaining cost of the workshop. How much money is Oliver still missing?",113.0,"To find out how much money Oliver is still missing, we need to calculate the total cost of the workshop and then subtract the amount of money he has and the amount of money his friends and the charity have covered.

The cost of the workshop for each day is:
Hotel: ₣100
Food: ₣20 (covered by friends)
Transportation: ₣10

Total cost per day: ₣100 + ₣20 - ₣20 = ₣100

Since the workshop is 2 days long, the total cost is:
₣100 x 2 = ₣200

Oliver has ₣85, but he doesn't need to cover the food cost. The charity will cover 1/10 of the remaining cost, which is:
₣200 - ₣85 = ₣115 (remaining cost)
1/10 of ₣115 is: ₣115 x 1/10 = ₣11.50

The charity will cover ₣11.50, so Oliver still needs to cover:
₣115 - ₣11.50 = ₣103.50

Oliver has ₣85, so he is still missing:
₣103.50 - ₣85 = ₣18.50

The answer is ₣18.50.",18.5,0,"Let's think step by step.

The workshop is for 2 days. 
The daily cost is ₣100 for hotel, ₣20 for food, and ₣10 for transportation.
So, the total daily cost is ₣100 + ₣20 + ₣10 = ₣130.

For the 2-day workshop, the total cost is 2 * ₣130 = ₣260.

Oliver's friends have covered the cost of the food, so the remaining cost is ₣260 - ₣20 * 2 (for the 2 days) = ₣260 - ₣40 = ₣220.

The local charity has agreed to cover 1/10 of the remaining cost, which is ₣220 / 10 = ₣22.

So, the cost covered by the charity is ₣22, and Oliver will need to cover the remaining amount, which is ₣220 - ₣22 = ₣198.

Oliver has ₣85 and needs to cover ₣198.

The bakery has a promotion that if one buys 7 bagels or more, they get a 20% discount on bagels. How much more do 4 loaves of bread cost than 8 bagels?",12.0,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Find the cost of a bagel**

The cost of a bagel is one-fourth of a loaf of bread, which is €5. So, the cost of a bagel is:
€5 ÷ 4 = €1.25

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of 8 bagels**

Since the cost of a bagel is €1.25, the cost of 8 bagels is:
€1.25 × 8 = €10

**Step 3: Check if the promotion applies**

The promotion applies if one buys 7 bagels or more. Since 8 bagels is more than 7, the promotion applies.

**Step 4: Calculate the discount on 8 bagels**

The promotion offers a 20% discount on bagels. To calculate the discount, multiply the cost of 8 bagels by 20%:
€10 × 0.20 = €2

**Step 5: Calculate the discounted cost of 8 bagels**

Subtract the discount from the original cost of 8 bagels:
€10 - €2 = €8

**Step 6: Calculate the cost of 4 loaves of bread**

The cost of 4 loaves of bread is:
€5 × 4 = €20

**Step 7: Find the difference between the cost of 4 loaves of bread and 8 bagels**

Subtract the cost of 8 bagels (with the discount) from the cost of 4 loaves of bread:
€20 - €8 = €12

Therefore, 4 loaves of bread cost €12 more than 8 bagels.",8.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

The cost of a loaf of bread is given as €5.

The cost of a bagel is one-fourth of a loaf of bread.
So, the cost of one bagel is 5 / 4 = 1.25.
One bagel costs €1.25.

The bakery has a promotion that if one buys 7 bagels or more, they get a 20% discount on bagels. 

First, let's find out the cost of 8 bagels without the discount.
8 bagels will cost 8 * 1.25 = 10.
Since 8 is less than 7, we will not get a discount (by the rule ""7 or more""). 

However, the problem asks for the cost of 8 bagels (not 7 or more to get a discount, but just 8 bagels), so we should not apply the discount.

Now, let's calculate the cost of 4 loaves of bread.
The cost of 4 loaves of bread is 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, let's calculate how much more 4 loaves of bread cost than 8 bagels.
The difference in cost is 20 - 10 = 10.

The answer is 10.",10.0,0,"The cost of a bagel is one-fourth of a loaf of bread, which is €5 / 4 = €1.25.
Since the bakery has a promotion for a 20% discount on 7 or more bagels, we need to calculate the cost of 8 bagels first.
The original cost of 8 bagels is 8 * €1.25 = €10.00.
The discount on 8 bagels is 20% of €10.00, which is 0.20 * €10.00 = €2.00.
So, the discounted cost of 8 bagels is €10.00 - €2.00 = €8.00.
Now, let's find the total cost of 4 loaves of bread.
The cost of 4 loaves of bread is 4 * €5.00 = €20.00.

**Elena's calculation**

1. Calculate the total cost of anchors: 
   Number of anchors: 15
   Cost per anchor: $0.26
   Total cost of anchors: 15 * $0.26 = $3.90

2. Calculate the total cost of nails:
   Number of nails: 9
   Cost per nail: $0.61
   Total cost of nails: 9 * $0.61 = $5.49

3. Calculate the total cost of paint:
   Number of gallons: 10
   Cost per gallon: $1.00 (10% discount for members is applied later)
   Total cost of paint: 10 * $1.00 = $10.00

4. Calculate the discounted total cost of paint:
   Discount: 10% of $10.00 = 0.10 * $10.00 = $1.00
   Discounted total cost of paint: $10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00

5. Calculate the total amount Elena spent:
   Total cost of anchors: $3.90
   Total cost of nails: $5.49
   Total cost of paint: $9.00
   Total amount spent: $3.90 + $5.49 + $9.00 = $18.39

Elena's purchases:

1. 15 anchors: Each anchor costs $0.26, so the total cost of anchors is 15 * $0.26 = $3.90.
2. 9 nails: Each nail costs $0.61, so the total cost of nails is 9 * $0.61 = $5.49.
3. 10 gallons of paint: The regular price of paint is $7.00 per gallon, so the total cost of paint is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00. However, since the store offers a 10% discount for members, Jamal gets a discount on the paint. The discount amount is 10% of $70.00, which is 0.10 * $70.00 = $7.00. So, the discounted price of paint for Jamal is $70.00 - $7.00 = $63.00. Elena, being a non-member, does not get the discount, so she pays the regular price of $70.00 for the paint.
4. Total cost for Elena: $3.90 (anchors) + $5.49 (nails) + $70.00 (paint) = $79.39.

Jamal's purchases:

1. 10 gallons of paint: The discounted price of paint for Jamal is $63.00.
2. 3 carpenter pencils: Each pencil costs $2, so the total cost of pencils is 3 * $2 = $6.00.
3. Total cost for Jamal: $63.00 (paint) + $6.00 (pencils) = $69.00.

Now, let's calculate how much money each of them has left:

Initially, Arash eats 5 pieces per day, Ava eats twice as much as Arash (10 pieces per day), and DeShawn eats twice as much as Ava (20 pieces per day).

So, the total number of pieces eaten per day is:
5 (Arash) + 10 (Ava) + 20 (DeShawn) = 35 pieces per day

After 2 days, DeShawn cuts his consumption by half, so he now eats 10 pieces per day (half of 20).

The new total number of pieces eaten per day is:
5 (Arash) + 10 (Ava) + 10 (DeShawn) = 25 pieces per day

Since the cake has 120 pieces, we can divide this number by the total number of pieces eaten per day to determine how many days it will take for the cake to be fully eaten:

Arash can eat 5 pieces a day.
Ava can eat twice as much as Arash, so Ava can eat 5 x 2 = 10 pieces a day.
DeShawn can eat twice as much as Ava, so DeShawn can eat 10 x 2 = 20 pieces a day.

Initially, the total number of pieces eaten per day is 5 + 10 + 20 = 35.

The cake has 120 pieces, and 70 pieces have been eaten. So, the number of pieces left is 120 - 70 = 50.

Since DeShawn cuts his consumption by half, he can now eat 20 / 2 = 10 pieces a day.

The total number of pieces eaten per day is now 5 + 10 + 10 = 25.

To find out how many days it will take to eat the remaining 50 pieces, we can divide 50 by 25.

   1/4 of 1900 is 1900 / 4 = 475 rooms occupied.

2. Calculate the number of rooms out of service:
   One-fourth of all the rooms are out of service. 
   1/4 of 1900 is 1900 / 4 = 475 rooms out of service.

3. Calculate the total number of rooms that are either occupied or out of service:
   Total occupied or out of service rooms = 475 (occupied) + 475 (out of service) = 950 rooms.

4. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms:
   Total capacity = 1900 rooms
   Total occupied or out of service rooms = 950 rooms

The total number of rooms that are either occupied or out of service is 475 + 475 = 950.

The care facility has 1900 rooms in total.

So, the number of unoccupied rooms is 1900 - 950 = 950.

If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?",796.0,"To find Faisal's average daily earning, we first need to calculate the total earnings for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

Let's break down the information:

Wednesday:
- Boxes of muffins: 27
- Boxes of apricot pie: 13 fewer than Thursday, so let's represent the number of boxes of apricot pie sold on Thursday as x, then the number of boxes of apricot pie on Wednesday is x - 13
- Total earnings on Wednesday = (27 * ₺9) + ((x-13) * ₺21)

Thursday:
- Boxes of muffins: 11 more than Wednesday, so 27 + 11 = 38
- Boxes of apricot pie: x
- Total earnings on Thursday = (38 * ₺9) + (x * ₺21)

Friday:
- Total earnings on Friday = Total earnings on Wednesday + Total earnings on Thursday

Since he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined, the total earnings for Thursday and Wednesday should be the same as Friday. Let's express this as:

Earnings on Wednesday + Earnings on Thursday = Earnings on Friday
(27 * ₺9) + ((x-13) * ₺21) + (38 * ₺9) + (x * ₺21) = ((27 * ₺9) + ((x-13) * ₺21)) + ((38 * ₺9) + (x * ₺21))

Simplifying the equation:

(27 * ₺9) + ((x-13) * ₺21) + (38 * ₺9) + (x * ₺21) = (27 * ₺9) + ((x-13) * ₺21) + (38 * ₺9) + (x * ₺21)

Combine like terms:
(27 * ₺9) + (38 * ₺9) = (27 * ₺9) + (38 * ₺9)

(x-13) * ₺21 = (x-13) * ₺21
(x * ₺21) cancels out. (x * ₺21) cancels out

Now simplify what is left on both sides of the equation:
(x-13) * ₺21 = (x-13) * ₺21

Notice that the (x-13) * ₺21 cancels out both sides of the equation. 
Since both sides are equal and both sides are the same expression (x-13) * ₺21 then the value for (x-13) * ₺21 is equal to both sides. Thus we do not need to solve the equation any more since it is already equal.",21.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many boxes of muffins and apricot pies Faisal sold on Wednesday and Thursday.

On Wednesday, Faisal sold 27 boxes of muffins.
On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday, so he sold 27 + 11 = 38 boxes of muffins.
On Thursday, he sold 21 boxes of apricot pie.
On Wednesday, he sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie than on Thursday, so he sold 21 - 13 = 8 boxes of apricot pie.

Now, let's find out how many boxes of muffins and apricot pies Faisal sold in total on Wednesday and Thursday.
On Wednesday, he sold 27 + 8 = 35 boxes of muffins and apricot pies.
On Thursday, he sold 38 + 21 = 59 boxes of muffins and apricot pies.
In total, he sold 35 + 59 = 94 boxes of muffins and apricot pies.

On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined, so he sold 94 boxes of muffins and apricot pies.

Now, let's find out how many boxes of muffins and apricot pies Faisal sold on each day.
On Wednesday, he sold 27 boxes of muffins and 8 boxes of apricot pie.
On Thursday, he sold 38 boxes of muffins and 21 boxes of apricot pie.
On Friday, he sold 94 / 2 = 47 boxes of muffins and 47 / 2 = 23.5 boxes of apricot pie (we can't sell half a box, so we'll round down to 23 boxes of apricot pie).

Now, let's find out how much money Faisal earned on each day.
On Wednesday, he sold 27 boxes of muffins for ₺9 each, so he earned 27 * 9 = ₺243.
He also sold 8 boxes of apricot pie for ₺21 each, so he earned 8 * 21 = ₺168.
In total, he earned ₺243 + ₺168 = ₺411 on Wednesday.
On Thursday, he sold 38 boxes of muffins for ₺9 each, so he earned 38 * 9 = ₺342.
He also sold 21 boxes of apricot pie for ₺21 each, so he earned 21 * 21 = ₺441.
In total, he earned ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783 on Thursday.
On Friday, he sold 47 boxes of muffins for ₺9 each, so he earned 47 * 9 = ₺423.
He also sold 23 boxes of apricot pie for ₺21 each, so he earned 23 * 21 = ₺483.
In total, he earned ₺423 + ₺483 = ₺906 on Friday.

Now, let's find out Faisal's average daily earning.
Faisal earned ₺411 on Wednesday, ₺783 on Thursday, and ₺906 on Friday.

A: Let's think step by step.

On Wednesday, Faisal sold 27 boxes of muffins and 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie than on Thursday. Let's call the number of apricot pie boxes sold on Thursday ""x"". Then, the number of apricot pie boxes sold on Wednesday is x - 13.

On Thursday, Faisal sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday, which is 27 + 11 = 38 boxes of muffins. He also sold 21 boxes of apricot pie.

So, on Wednesday, Faisal sold 27 boxes of muffins and (x - 13) boxes of apricot pie. On Thursday, he sold 38 boxes of muffins and 21 boxes of apricot pie.

On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. This means he sold a total of (27 + (x - 13)) + (38 + 21) boxes of muffins and apricot pies.

To find the total number of boxes sold on Friday, we need to find the value of x. We know that on Thursday, Faisal sold 21 boxes of apricot pie, which is 13 more than the number of apricot pie boxes sold on Wednesday. So, the number of apricot pie boxes sold on Wednesday is 21 - 13 = 8.

Now, we can find the total number of boxes sold on Friday: (27 + (8 - 13)) + (38 + 21) = (27 - 5) + 59 = 22 + 59 = 81.

The total number of boxes sold on Friday is 81.

To find the total amount earned on Friday, we multiply the total number of boxes sold by the cost of each item: (27 + (8 - 13)) * 9 + (38 + 21) * 21 = (27 - 5) * 9 + 59 * 21 = 22 * 9 + 59 * 21 = 198 + 1239 = 1437.

The total amount earned on Friday is ₺1437.

To find the average daily earning, we divide the total amount earned by the number of days: 1437 / 3 = 479.

Half of the swimmers are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the tournament?",66.0,"To find out how many students are leaving early for the tournament, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and then add them together.

1. First, let's find out how many swimmers are in the class. 
   50% of 120 students are swimmers. 
   To find 50% of 120, we multiply 120 by 0.5.
   120 * 0.5 = 60 swimmers.

2. Since half of the swimmers are absent due to sickness, we need to find out how many swimmers are still in the class.
   Half of 60 is 60 / 2 = 30 swimmers.

3. Now, let's find out how many students are not swimmers. 
   Total students - swimmers = 120 - 60 = 60 non-swimmers.

4. Out of the non-swimmers, 45% are either choir members or dancers. 
   To find 45% of 60, we multiply 60 by 0.45.
   60 * 0.45 = 27 choir members or dancers.

5. Now, let's find out how many non-swimmers are not choir members or dancers.
   Non-swimmers - choir members or dancers = 60 - 27 = 33 non-swimmers.

6. Since each group has 3 cheerleaders, we need to add 3 to the total number of students leaving for each group.
   The number of swimmers leaving is 30 + 3 = 33 students.
   The number of choir members or dancers leaving is 27 + 3 = 30 students.

7. Now, let's add the students from each group to find the total number of students leaving for the tournament.

Q: In Mrs. Garcia's class of 120 students, 50% of the class are swimmers. Out of the remaining class, 45% of the students are choir members or part of dancers. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away tournament. Half of the swimmers are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the tournament?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the number of swimmers in the class. Since 50% of the class are swimmers, we can calculate this as follows:
50% of 120 students = 0.5 * 120 = 60 swimmers.

Next, we need to find the number of students who are not swimmers. This is the remaining 50% of the class:
120 students - 60 swimmers = 60 non-swimmers.

Out of the non-swimmers, 45% are choir members or part of dancers. We can calculate this as follows:
45% of 60 non-swimmers = 0.45 * 60 = 27 students.

So, the total number of students who are swimmers or part of the choir/dancers is:
60 swimmers + 27 students = 87 students.

However, we are told that half of the swimmers are absent for being sick. This means that only half of the swimmers will be leaving early:
60 swimmers / 2 = 30 swimmers.

Additionally, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. Since there are 3 groups (swimmers, choir, and dancers), we need to add 3 cheerleaders for each group:
3 cheerleaders/group * 3 groups = 9 cheerleaders.

Olga's flower bed is 132 meters long. She wants to leave 12 meters between each plant, including the plant's width, which is 3 meters. So, the total space each plant will occupy is 3 + 12 = 15 meters.

To find out how many plants Olga can fit in her flower bed, we need to divide the length of the flower bed by the space each plant will occupy:

How many minutes will it take her to peel and saute 150 clams if it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam before peeling it? Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.,163.0,"To find out how many minutes it will take Olga to peel 150 clams, first, we need to calculate the time it takes her to peel the clams. 

Olga peels 6 clams per minute and she has 150 clams. 

150 clams / 6 clams per minute = 25 minutes to peel 150 clams.

Since it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam, we need to find how many minutes that is. 

12 seconds = 12/60 = 0.2 minutes per clam. 

Multiply the washing time per clam by the number of clams: 
0.2 minutes per clam * 150 clams = 30 minutes to wash all the clams.

Now, add the time it takes to peel and wash the clams:
25 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (washing) = 55 minutes

After peeling the clams, Olga has to take a 13-minute break before sautéing them. 

So, add the break time to the peeling and washing time: 
55 minutes + 13 minutes = 68 minutes

Finally, Olga also needs to sauté the clams. Since it takes her 19 minutes to sauté 30 clams, we need to find how many batches of 30 clams she has to sauté. 

150 clams / 30 clams per batch = 5 batches. 

Since Olga can only sauté one batch at a time, it will take her 5 * 19 minutes = 95 minutes to sauté all the clams.

To find the total time, add the time it takes to peel, wash, and sauté the clams: 
68 minutes + 95 minutes = 163 minutes.",163.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller tasks and calculate the time required for each task.

Task 1: Washing the clams
Olga needs to wash 150 clams, and it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam. 
So, the total time spent washing the clams is 150 * 12 = 1800 seconds.
To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute).
1800 seconds / 60 = 30 minutes

Task 2: Peeling the clams
Olga can peel 6 clams per minute.
To peel 150 clams, she needs (150 / 6) minutes.
150 / 6 = 25 minutes

Task 3: Taking a break
Olga needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams.

Task 4: Sautering the clams
Olga needs to sauté 150 clams, and it takes her 19 minutes to sauté 30 clams.
To find the time it takes to sauté 150 clams, we can first find the rate at which she sautés the clams, which is 30 / 19 = 1.58 clams per minute (approximately).
Now, we divide 150 by 1.58 to get the number of minutes required to sauté the clams.
150 / 1.58 ≈ 94.88 minutes (round to 94.9 minutes)

Now, let's add up the time required for all tasks:

How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?",1755.0,"To find out how many pizzas the family eats in two months, we'll break the problem down into two parts: the first month and the second month.

First Month:
The family eats a combination of pizzas per day:
- Uncle: 10 pizzas
- Spouse: 20 pizzas
- Combined: 10 + 20 = 30 pizzas
Their grandchild eats 2/4 of this combined total, which is 1/2 or 50% of 30:
- Grandchild: 30 * 0.5 = 15 pizzas
Total pizzas per day for the first month: 10 + 20 + 15 = 45 pizzas.

In one month, there are 30 days. So, pizzas consumed in the first month = 45 pizzas per day * 30 days = 1350 pizzas.

Second Month:
The family reduces their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month and by an additional 50% for the second half. To simplify the calculation, we'll calculate the pizzas consumed per day for both halves.

First Half (15 days):
- Reduction by 60% of the total pizzas per day: 45 * 0.4 = 18 pizzas per day
- Grandchild's pizzas per day: 18 * 0.5 = 9 pizzas per day (50% of the reduced amount)
- Total pizzas per day for the first half: 18 + 20 + 9 = 47 pizzas per day

5. In one month (30 days), the family eats 45 * 30 = 1350 pizzas.

**Second Month:**

1. The family reduces their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month. This means they eat 40% of their usual amount. 40% of 45 pizzas per day is 0.4 * 45 = 18 pizzas per day.
2. For the first half of the month (15 days), the family eats 18 * 15 = 270 pizzas.
3. For the second half of the month, they reduce their consumption by an additional 50%. This means they eat 50% of their reduced amount. 50% of 18 pizzas per day is 0.5 * 18 = 9 pizzas per day.

After accounting for the 700 seats for graduate, 450 seats for the faculty attending, and reserving 50 seats for the event's staff, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?

A: Let's think step by step.
The total capacity of the Sports Arena is 9600 people.
However, we need to subtract the seats reserved for the graduates (700), faculty (450), and staff (50).
So, the number of seats reserved is 700 + 450 + 50 = 1200.
The number of seats available for the graduates and their guests is 9600 - 1200 = 8400.
There are 700 graduates, and the tickets are split equally among them.
So, each graduate receives 8400 / 700 = 12 tickets.

From the rest, Mohammed can only respond to 2 less than the 1/2 of them. How many emails does Mohammed respond to in a 6 day work week? Mohammed work overtime on the last day so he can respond to 10% more emails than usual.",61.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of emails that don't require a response**

Mohammed receives 30 emails a day. 20% of those emails don't require any response. To find 20% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.2:

30 x 0.2 = 6

So, 6 emails don't require a response.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of emails that require a response**

The remaining emails that require a response are:

30 - 6 = 24

**Step 3: Calculate the number of emails that Mohammed can respond to**

Mohammed can respond to 2 less than half of the remaining emails. To find half of 24, we divide 24 by 2:

24 ÷ 2 = 12

Then, we subtract 2 from 12:

12 - 2 = 10

So, Mohammed can respond to 10 emails per day.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of emails that Mohammed responds to in a 6-day work week**

In a 6-day work week, Mohammed responds to 10 emails per day. To find the total number of emails he responds to, we multiply 10 by 6:

10 x 6 = 60

**Step 5: Calculate the number of emails that Mohammed responds to on the last day**

On the last day, Mohammed works overtime and can respond to 10% more emails than usual. To find 10% of 10, we multiply 10 by 0.1:

10 x 0.1 = 1

So, Mohammed can respond to 1 more email on the last day.

**Step 6: Calculate the total number of emails that Mohammed responds to in a 6-day work week, including the last day**

We already calculated that Mohammed responds to 60 emails in a 6-day work week. On the last day, he responds to 10 + 1 = 11 emails. To find the total number of emails he responds to, we add 11 to 60:

60 + 11 = 71

Therefore, Mohammed responds to 71 emails in a 6-day work week, including the last day.",6.0,0,"Let's think step by step to solve this problem.

Mohammed receives 30 emails a day.

Step 1: Calculate the number of emails that don't require a response.
20% of 30 emails don't require any response.
So, the number of emails that don't require a response is 20% of 30 = 0.2 * 30 = 6.

Step 2: Calculate the number of emails that require a response.
Since Mohammed receives 30 emails a day and 6 of them don't require a response, he receives 30 - 6 = 24 emails that require a response.

Step 3: Calculate the number of emails Mohammed can respond to on a regular day.
He can respond to 2 less than half of the emails that require a response.
Half of 24 emails is 24 / 2 = 12.
He can respond to 12 - 2 = 10 emails on a regular day.

Step 4: Calculate the number of emails Mohammed responds to in a 6-day work week.
In a regular 6-day work week, Mohammed responds to 10 emails per day.
So, he responds to 10 * 6 = 60 emails.

Step 5: Calculate the number of emails Mohammed responds to on the last day when he works overtime.
He responds to 10% more emails than usual.
10% of 10 emails is 0.1 * 10 = 1.
So, he responds to 10 + 1 = 11 emails on the last day.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of emails Mohammed responds to in a 6-day work week with overtime.
He responds to 60 emails in the regular 6 days.
On the last day, he responds to 11 emails.
So, the total number of emails he responds to is 60 + 11 = 71.

The answer is 71.",71.0,0,"Let's think step by step to solve the problem.

Mohammed receives 30 emails a day. 20% of those emails don't require any response. To find out the number of emails that require response, we need to calculate 20% of 30.
20% of 30 is 0.20 * 30 = 6.
So, the number of emails that require response is 30 - 6 = 24.

From the rest, Mohammed can only respond to 2 less than the 1/2 of them. To find the number of emails Mohammed can respond to, we need to calculate half of 24.
Half of 24 is 24 / 2 = 12.
Mohammed can respond to 12 - 2 = 10 emails.

Mohammed works for 6 days in a week. In the first 5 days, he responds to 10 emails per day.
So, the number of emails he responds to in 5 days is 10 * 5 = 50.
On the last day, he works overtime and can respond to 10% more emails than usual.
10% of 10 is 0.10 * 10 = 1.
So, the number of emails Mohammed responds to on the last day is 10 + 1 = 11.

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct,"Ananya walks 24 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 miles of walking on the beach and 14 miles of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?",85.0,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps.

Step 1: Calculate Ananya's original speed on the beach and sidewalk.

Let's assume Ananya's original speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

Step 2: Calculate Ananya's new speed on the beach and sidewalk after the injury.

Since Ananya's speed has decreased by half on both the beach and sidewalk, her new speed on the beach is x/2 miles per minute, and her new speed on the sidewalk is 2x/2 = x miles per minute.

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes for Ananya to walk 10 miles on the beach.

We know that Ananya walks 10 miles on the beach, and her new speed on the beach is x/2 miles per minute. We can use the formula time = distance/speed to calculate the time it takes for her to walk 10 miles on the beach.

time = 10 miles / (x/2 miles/minute) = 20/x minutes

Step 4: Calculate the time it takes for Ananya to walk 14 miles on the sidewalk.

We know that Ananya walks 14 miles on the sidewalk, and her new speed on the sidewalk is x miles per minute. We can use the formula time = distance/speed to calculate the time it takes for her to walk 14 miles on the sidewalk.

time = 14 miles / x miles/minute = 14/x minutes

Step 5: Calculate the total time it takes for Ananya to complete the entire 24-mile walk.

We know that Ananya spends 50 minutes walking on the beach. We can use the formula total time = time on beach + time on sidewalk to calculate the total time it takes for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk.

total time = 50 minutes + 20/x minutes + 14/x minutes

Step 6: Simplify the expression for total time.

total time = 50 minutes + (34/x) minutes

Since we know that Ananya walks 24 miles in total, we can set up the equation:

24 miles = 10 miles (on beach) + 14 miles (on sidewalk)

We can use this equation to solve for x.

10 miles / (x/2 miles/minute) + 14 miles / x miles/minute = 24 miles / (x/2 miles/minute)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20/x + 14/x = 48/x

Combine like terms:

34/x = 48/x

Multiply both sides by x:

34 = 48

This is a contradiction, which means that our assumption about x is incorrect. Let's go back to Step 3 and re-evaluate the time it takes for Ananya to walk 10 miles on the beach.

time = 10 miles / (x/2 miles/minute) = 20/x minutes

We know that Ananya spends 50 minutes walking on the beach. We can set up the equation:

20/x minutes = 50 minutes

Solving for x, we get:

x = 2.5 miles/minute

Now that we have the value of x, we can calculate the time it takes for Ananya to walk 14 miles on the sidewalk.

time = 14 miles / x miles/minute = 14 miles / 2.5 miles/minute = 5.6 minutes

Now we can calculate the total time it takes for Ananya to complete the entire 24-mile walk.

total time = 50 minutes + 5.6 minutes = 55.6 minutes

Rounding to the nearest minute, we get:

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$",56.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Ananya walks 10 miles on the beach and 14 miles on the sidewalk, for a total of 24 miles.

2. We need to find out how long it takes her to walk the beach and the sidewalk.

3. Since Ananya walks 50 minutes on the beach, we can find her speed on the beach. However, we first need to find her original speed, which has decreased by half. If x is her original speed, then 0.5x is her current speed on the beach.

4. To find her current speed on the beach, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time. The distance on the beach is 10 miles, and the time is 50 minutes, which we need to convert to hours. So, the time in hours is 50 / 60 = 5/6 hours.

   Now, we can set up the equation: 0.5x = 10 / (5/6). 

5. To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 2 * 10 / (5/6) = 2 * 10 * 6 / 5 = 24.

   So, her original speed on the beach is 24 miles per hour, and her current speed on the beach is 0.5 * 24 = 12 miles per hour.

6. We now need to find her speed on the sidewalk. Since her speed on the sidewalk is two times her speed on the beach, her original speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 24 = 48 miles per hour, and her current speed is 0.5 * 48 = 24 miles per hour.

7. We can now find the time it takes her to walk on the beach at her current speed: time = distance / speed. So, the time it takes her to walk on the beach is 10 / 12 = 5/6 hours.

8. We also need to find the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk: time = distance / speed. So, the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk is 14 / 24 = 7/12 hours.

9. We now convert the times to minutes: (5/6) * 60 = 50 minutes for the beach and (7/12) * 60 = 35 minutes for the sidewalk.

10. The total time it takes for her to walk the entire 24 miles is 50 minutes + 35 minutes = 85 minutes.

Amelia initially had 11 dozen cookies. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 11 dozen to a total number of cookies:

11 dozen = 11 * 12 = 132 cookies

So, Amelia initially had 132 cookies.

She ate 5 cookies for breakfast, so the number of cookies left is:

132 - 5 = 127 cookies

Then, she hid the rest in the yard for the Easter egg hunt. This means that 127 cookies are still hidden in the yard.

Elena finds 5 cookies. The number of cookies left in the yard is now:

127 - 5 = 122 cookies

Mei finds twice as many as Elena, which is 2 * 5 = 10 cookies. The number of cookies left in the yard is now:

Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier, which is 8 / 8 = 1 cookie. The number of cookies left in the yard is now:

104 - 1 = 103 cookies

Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined. Since Mei and Elena found 10 + 5 = 15 cookies, two dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 cookies. Umar finds 24 cookies. The number of cookies left in the yard is now:

103 - 24 = 79 cookies

The answer is 79.",79.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Amelia initially had 11 dozen cookies.
Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we need to convert 11 dozen cookies into individual cookies.
11 dozen * 12 = 132 cookies.

Amelia ate 5 cookies for breakfast.
So, the number of cookies remaining is 132 - 5 = 127.

Now, let's consider the number of cookies found by each person.
Elena finds 5 cookies.
Mei finds twice as many as Elena, which is 5 * 2 = 10 cookies.
Xavier finds 2 less than Mei, which is 10 - 2 = 8 cookies.
Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier, which is 8 / 8 = 1 cookie.
Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined, which is (5 + 10) * 12 = 180 cookies.

Now, let's add the number of cookies found by each person.
The total number of cookies found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 1 + 180 = 204 cookies.

To find the number of cookies still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of cookies found from the initial number of cookies.
So, the number of cookies left is 132 - 204 = -72.
However, this is not possible as we cannot have a negative number of cookies.

Let's reconsider the problem. 
We made a mistake in calculating Umar's cookies. 
Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined, which is 2 * 12 = 24. But this is the number of cookies Umar finds for the two people. To find the total number of cookies Umar finds, we need to multiply this by 2 since Umar finds twice the number of cookies for the two people combined, and then add the cookies found by Mei and Elena.
But actually, Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined, so the correct answer is simply 24 cookies for Umar alone. 
Now, let's add the number of cookies found by each person.
The total number of cookies found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 1 + 24 = 48 cookies.

To find the number of cookies still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of cookies found from the initial number of cookies.
So, the number of cookies left is 132 - 48 = 84.

How much money does he make in a week?",1243.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes**

The first 2 complexes have 100 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these 2 complexes is:
100 + 100 = 200

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of apartments in all 3 complexes**

The last complex is 35% bigger than the other 2 combined, which means it is 135% of the other 2 combined. To calculate this, we multiply the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes by 1.35:
200 x 1.35 = 270

So, the total number of apartments in all 3 complexes is 270.

1. The janitor has to clean 200 rooms in 10 days.

There are 10 days, and each day is 8 hours long. 
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so each day is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes long.

The total number of minutes in 10 days is 10 * 480 = 4800 minutes.

The janitor spends 2400 minutes cleaning rooms out of 4800 minutes in 10 days.
To find the percentage of time spent cleaning, we divide the time spent cleaning by the total time and multiply by 100.

So, the percentage of time spent cleaning is (2400 / 4800) * 100 = 50%.

The answer is 50%.",50.0,1,,50.0,1
gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct,"Noah is popping popcorn for a snack. As the skillet of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 70 pop in the first 10 seconds of cooking, then 2 times that amount in the next 10 seconds. The kernels increase to 4 times the initial popping rate in the next 10 seconds. In the final 10 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 10 seconds. After Noah takes the skillet off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. Noah gives one-fifth of the made popcorn to his brother Luca. How many more pieces of popcorn does Noah have to eat than his brother?",399.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 10-second interval**

* First 10 seconds: 70 kernels
* Next 10 seconds: 2 times the initial amount = 2 × 70 = 140 kernels
* Next 10 seconds: 4 times the initial amount = 4 × 70 = 280 kernels
* Final 10 seconds: half the rate of the previous 10 seconds = 280 / 2 = 140 kernels

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of kernels that popped**

* Total = 70 + 140 + 280 + 140 = 530 kernels

**Step 3: Calculate the number of kernels that popped from residual heat**

* A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds = (1/4) × 140 = 35 kernels

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of kernels that popped**

* Total = 530 (from heat) + 35 (from residual heat) = 565 kernels

**Step 5: Calculate the number of kernels that Noah gives to Luca**

* One-fifth of the total number of kernels = (1/5) × 565 = 113 kernels

**Step 6: Calculate the number of kernels that Noah has left**

* Noah has 565 - 113 = 452 kernels left

**Step 7: Calculate the difference between the number of kernels that Noah and Luca have**

* Noah has 452 kernels, and Luca has 113 kernels. The difference is 452 - 113 = 339 kernels.

Therefore, Noah has 339 more pieces of popcorn to eat than his brother Luca.",339.0,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of kernels that popped in the first 10 seconds.**
70 kernels popped in the first 10 seconds.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of kernels that popped in the next 10 seconds.**
The kernels popped 2 times the initial amount, so 2 * 70 = 140 kernels popped in the next 10 seconds.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of kernels that popped in the first 20 seconds.**
70 + 140 = 210 kernels popped in the first 20 seconds.

**Step 4: Calculate the number of kernels that popped in the next 10 seconds.**
The kernels popped 4 times the initial amount, so 4 * 70 = 280 kernels popped in the next 10 seconds.

**Step 5: Calculate the total number of kernels that popped in the first 30 seconds.**
210 + 280 = 490 kernels popped in the first 30 seconds.

**Step 6: Calculate the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds.**
The kernels popped at half the rate of the past 10 seconds, so 280 / 2 = 140 kernels popped in the final 10 seconds.

**Step 7: Calculate the number of kernels that popped from residual heat.**
A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds also popped from residual heat, so 140 / 4 = 35 kernels popped from residual heat.

**Step 8: Calculate the total number of kernels that popped.**
490 + 140 + 35 = 665 kernels popped in total.

**Step 9: Calculate the number of kernels that Noah gave to his brother Luca.**
Noah gave one-fifth of the total kernels to Luca, so 665 / 5 = 133 kernels.

**Step 10: Calculate the number of kernels that Noah has left.**
Noah has 665 - 133 = 532 kernels left.

**Step 11: Calculate the number of kernels that Noah's brother Luca has.**
Luca has 133 kernels.

**Step 12: Calculate the difference between the number of kernels that Noah and Luca have.**
Noah has 532 kernels, and Luca has 133 kernels. So, Noah has 532 - 133 = 399 more kernels than Luca.

We know that there are 5 white bricks and twice as many orange bricks, which is 2 * 5 = 10 orange bricks.

The total number of white and orange bricks is 5 + 10 = 15 bricks.

Since the total number of bricks in the building is 30, the number of green bricks is 30 - 15 = 15.

To find the percentage of green bricks, divide the number of green bricks by the total number of bricks and multiply by 100.

Percentage of green bricks = (15 / 30) * 100

So, 50% of the bricks in the building are green.",50.0,1,"I'll follow the format you provided to solve the problem step by step.

Q: A building is made out of 5 white bricks, twice as many orange bricks, and an unknown number of green bricks. If there are 30 bricks in the building in total, what percentage of bricks are green?

A: Let's think step by step.

The building has 5 white bricks.
There are twice as many orange bricks as white bricks, so there are 5 * 2 = 10 orange bricks.
The total number of white and orange bricks is 5 + 10 = 15.
Since there are 30 bricks in total, the number of green bricks is 30 - 15 = 15.
To find the percentage of green bricks, we need to divide the number of green bricks by the total number of bricks and multiply by 100.
So, the percentage of green bricks is (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.

Olivia, who is younger than Bodhi but older than Keisha, will be 42 in 7 years. How much younger is Keisha than the average age of all three?",18.0,"Let's break down the given information:

1. Olivia is 24 years younger than Bodhi.
2. Olivia is 15 years older than Keisha.
3. Olivia will be 42 in 7 years, so her current age is 42 - 7 = 35 years.

Since Olivia is 24 years younger than Bodhi and 15 years older than Keisha, we can represent Bodhi's age as 35 + 24 = 59 years and Keisha's age as 35 - 15 = 20 years.

Now, let's find the average age of the three: (Olivia's age + Bodhi's age + Keisha's age) / 3
= (35 + 59 + 20) / 3
= 114 / 3
= 38 years

Keisha's age is 20, and the average age is 38, so Keisha is 38 - 20 = 18 years younger than the average age of the three.",18.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

We know that Olivia will be 42 in 7 years. 

So, Olivia's current age is 42 - 7 = 35.

We also know that Olivia and Bodhi are 24 years apart in age. 

Since Olivia is younger than Bodhi, Bodhi's age is 35 + 24 = 59.

We also know that Olivia and Keisha are 15 years apart in age. 

Since Olivia is older than Keisha, Keisha's age is 35 - 15 = 20.

Now, we need to find the average age of all three, which is (Olivia's age + Bodhi's age + Keisha's age) / 3.

So, the average age = (35 + 59 + 20) / 3 = 114 / 3 = 38.

Now that we have the average age of all three, we need to find out how much younger Keisha is than the average age.

The difference is 38 - 20 = 18.
