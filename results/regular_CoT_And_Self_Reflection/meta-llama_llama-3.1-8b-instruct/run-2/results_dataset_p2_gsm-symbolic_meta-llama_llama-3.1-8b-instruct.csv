She bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, and 60 mini cheesecakes. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,"To find the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen, we need to first find the total cost of the donuts and the mini cupcakes before the discount. 

1. Calculate the total cost of donuts:
   Sophia bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen. 
   Since 60 donuts is 5 dozen, the cost of the donuts is:
   Cost of donuts = 5 * 19 = 95 dollars

2. Calculate the total cost of mini cupcakes:
   Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen.
   Since 60 mini cupcakes is 5 dozen, the cost of the mini cupcakes is:
   Cost of mini cupcakes = 5 * 33 = 165 dollars

3. Calculate the total cost of donuts and mini cupcakes:
   Total cost of donuts and mini cupcakes = 95 + 165 = 260 dollars

4. Calculate the total amount paid after the discount:
   Sophia paid a total of $1500 after a 20% discount. This means the original price was 1500 / (1 - 0.20) = 1500 / 0.80 = 1875 dollars.

5. Calculate the cost of mini cheesecakes:
   The total cost of mini cheesecakes is 1875 - 260 = 1615 dollars.

6. Calculate the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen:
   Since Sophia bought 60 mini cheesecakes, the total is 60 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   Cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen = 1615 / 60 = 26.9167 dollars per dozen.

The cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is approximately 26.92 dollars.",26.92,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes. 
A dozen donuts cost $19 and she bought 5 dozens (60 / 12 = 5).
A dozen mini cupcakes cost $33 and she bought 5 dozens (60 / 12 = 5).
So, the total cost of donuts is 5 * $19 = $95.
The total cost of mini cupcakes is 5 * $33 = $165.

The total cost of donuts and mini cupcakes is $95 + $165 = $260.

Sophia paid a total of $1500 after a 20% discount.
So, the original price of all items was $1500 / (1 - 0.2) = $1500 / 0.8 = $1875.

Now, we know the total cost of donuts and mini cupcakes ($260) and the original price of all items ($1875). 
The cost of mini cheesecakes is $1875 - $260 = $1615.

Since Sophia bought 5 dozens of mini cheesecakes, the cost per dozen is $1615 / 5 = $323.

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving. A 300 grams bag has 6 servings. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?",350.0,"## Step 1: Calculate Hiroshi's daily calorie target
To find Hiroshi's daily calorie target, we need to multiply his weight in pounds by 15 calories per pound. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, so his daily calorie target is 220 * 15 = 3300 calories.

## Step 2: Calculate Hiroshi's remaining calorie target
Hiroshi has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. To find his remaining calorie target, we need to subtract the calories he has already consumed and burned from his daily calorie target. Remaining calories for Hiroshi = 3300 - 1100 - 200 = 2000 calories.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of servings Hiroshi needs to consume
Since each serving of popcorn has 200 calories, we can divide Hiroshi's remaining calorie target by 200 to find the number of servings he needs to consume. Servings for Hiroshi = 2000 / 200 = 10 servings.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume
Since a 300-gram bag of popcorn has 6 servings, we can divide 300 by 6 to find the number of grams per serving. Grams per serving = 300 / 6 = 50 grams. Now, we can multiply the number of servings Hiroshi needs to consume by the grams per serving to find the total grams of popcorn he needs to consume. Total grams for Hiroshi = 10 * 50 = 500 grams.

## Step 5: Calculate Tara's daily calorie target
To find Tara's daily calorie target, we need to multiply her weight in pounds by 15 calories per pound. Tara weighs 140 lbs, so her daily calorie target is 140 * 15 = 2100 calories.

## Step 6: Calculate Tara's remaining calorie target
Tara has already consumed 900 calories in food and 200 calories in ice cream. To find her remaining calorie target, we need to subtract the calories she has already consumed from her daily calorie target. Remaining calories for Tara = 2100 - 900 - 200 = 1000 calories.

## Step 7: Calculate the number of servings Tara needs to consume
Since each serving of popcorn has 200 calories, we can divide Tara's remaining calorie target by 200 to find the number of servings she needs to consume. Servings for Tara = 1000 / 200 = 5 servings.

## Step 8: Calculate the number of grams of popcorn Tara needs to consume
Since a 300-gram bag of popcorn has 6 servings, we can divide 300 by 6 to find the number of grams per serving. Grams per serving = 300 / 6 = 50 grams. Now, we can multiply the number of servings Tara needs to consume by the grams per serving to find the total grams of popcorn she needs to consume. Total grams for Tara = 5 * 50 = 250 grams.

## Step 9: Calculate the difference in grams of popcorn Hiroshi and Tara need to consume
To find the difference in grams of popcorn Hiroshi and Tara need to consume, we need to subtract the total grams Tara needs to consume from the total grams Hiroshi needs to consume. Difference = 500 - 250 = 250 grams.

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$",250.0,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many calories Hiroshi and Tara can consume in a day.
Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and the healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight.
So, Hiroshi's daily calorie target is 220 * 15 = 3300 calories.
He has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise.
So, he still needs to consume 3300 - 1100 - 200 = 2000 calories.
Tara weighs 140 lbs, and the healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight.
So, Tara's daily calorie target is 140 * 15 = 2100 calories.
She has already consumed 900 calories in food and 200 calories in ice cream.
So, she still needs to consume 2100 - 900 - 200 = 1000 calories.
Now, we need to find out how many grams of popcorn each of them needs to consume.
A bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving, and a 300 grams bag has 6 servings.
So, each serving has 300 / 6 = 50 grams of popcorn.
Hiroshi needs to consume 2000 calories, and each serving has 200 calories.
So, he needs to consume 2000 / 200 = 10 servings of popcorn.
Tara needs to consume 1000 calories, and each serving has 200 calories.
So, she needs to consume 1000 / 200 = 5 servings of popcorn.
Now, we need to find out how many grams of popcorn each of them needs to consume.
Hiroshi needs to consume 10 servings, and each serving has 50 grams of popcorn.
So, Hiroshi needs to consume 10 * 50 = 500 grams of popcorn.
Tara needs to consume 5 servings, and each serving has 50 grams of popcorn.
So, Tara needs to consume 5 * 50 = 250 grams of popcorn.
Finally, we need to find out how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara.
Hiroshi needs to consume 500 grams of popcorn, and Tara needs to consume 250 grams of popcorn.
So, Hiroshi needs to consume 500 - 250 = 250 more grams of popcorn than Tara.
The answer is 250.",250.0,0,"I'll provide the corrected reasoning and answer in the examples format.

Q: According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving. A 300 grams bag has 6 servings. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories Hiroshi and Tara can consume per day.
Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and the healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight.
So, Hiroshi's daily calorie target is 220 * 15 = 3300 calories.
He has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise.
So, he has consumed a total of 1100 + 200 = 1300 calories.
Therefore, he still needs to consume 3300 - 1300 = 2000 calories.

Tara weighs 140 lbs, and the healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight.
So, Tara's daily calorie target is 140 * 15 = 2100 calories.
She has already consumed 900 calories in food and 200 calories in ice cream.
So, she has consumed a total of 900 + 200 = 1100 calories.
Therefore, she still needs to consume 2100 - 1100 = 1000 calories.

Now, we need to find out how many grams of popcorn Hiroshi and Tara need to consume to meet their calorie targets.
A bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving, and a 300 grams bag has 6 servings.
So, the number of calories in a 300 grams bag is 6 * 200 = 1200 calories.
Therefore, the number of calories per gram of popcorn is 1200 / 300 = 4 calories per gram.

Hiroshi needs to consume 2000 calories, and each gram of popcorn has 4 calories.
So, he needs to consume 2000 / 4 = 500 grams of popcorn.

Tara needs to consume 1000 calories, and each gram of popcorn has 4 calories.
So, she needs to consume 1000 / 4 = 250 grams of popcorn.

Now, we need to find out how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara.
Hiroshi needs to consume 500 grams of popcorn, and Tara needs to consume 250 grams of popcorn.
So, Hiroshi needs to consume 500 - 250 = 250 grams more than Tara.

Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Daphne remain with?",335.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of potted plants Daphne already has**

Daphne has 56 window ledges, and each ledge has 8 potted plants. To find the total number of potted plants she already has, we multiply the number of ledges by the number of plants per ledge:

56 ledges × 8 plants/ledge = 448 plants

**Step 2: Calculate the number of new potted plants Daphne received**

Daphne received 23 new potted plants from the plant nursery two days ago.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of new potted plants Daphne purchased**

Daphne purchased 200 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount. Since it's a 50% discount, she only paid for half of the plants. To find the number of plants she actually purchased, we divide the total number of plants by 2:

200 plants ÷ 2 = 100 plants

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of potted plants Daphne has**

Now, let's add up the number of potted plants Daphne already has, the number she received, and the number she purchased:

448 plants (already has) + 23 plants (received) + 100 plants (purchased) = 571 plants

**Step 5: Calculate the number of potted plants Daphne will give away**

Daphne will give away 6 potted plants from each of the 56 window ledges. To find the total number of plants she will give away, we multiply the number of ledges by the number of plants per ledge:

56 ledges × 6 plants/ledge = 336 plants

**Step 6: Calculate the number of potted plants Daphne will remain with**

Finally, let's subtract the number of plants Daphne will give away from the total number of plants she has:

571 plants (total) - 336 plants (given away) = 235 plants

Therefore, Daphne will remain with 235 potted plants.",235.0,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Daphne starts with 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges of her home. 

First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants she already has:
8 potted plants per ledge * 56 ledges = 8 * 56 = 448 potted plants.

Two days ago, she received 23 new potted plants from the nursery:
448 (existing plants) + 23 (new plants) = 471 potted plants.

Yesterday, she purchased 200 new plants at a 50% discount. Since it's a 50% discount, she actually paid for 50% of the original price, which means she got 200 / 2 = 100 new plants for free. However, the problem states she purchased 200 new plants, so we'll consider the 200 plants as the ones she paid for. 

So, the total number of potted plants she has now is:
471 (existing plants) + 200 (new plants) = 671 potted plants.

Tomorrow, she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 56 ledges, she will give away:
6 potted plants per ledge * 56 ledges = 6 * 56 = 336 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants Daphne will remain with, we subtract the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has:
671 (total plants) - 336 (plants given away) = 335 potted plants.

However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

## Step 1: Determine the original rate at which the fog bank covers the city.
The fog bank covers 4 miles every 60 minutes.

## Step 2: Calculate the speed of the fog bank in miles per minute.
To find the speed of the fog bank in miles per minute, we divide the distance covered by the time taken. So, the speed is 4 miles / 60 minutes = 1/15 miles per minute.

## Step 3: Determine the effect of the wind speed being halved in one hour.
Since the wind speed is halved in one hour, it means the speed will be halved in 60 minutes. So, the new speed will be (1/15) / 2 = 1/30 miles per minute.

## Step 4: Calculate the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city at the new speed.
The city is 80 miles across, and we want to find the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city. 1/4 of 80 miles is 20 miles. At the new speed of 1/30 miles per minute, the time taken to cover 20 miles is 20 / (1/30) = 20 * 30 = 600 minutes.

However, we are asked to find the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, which is 20 miles, but we need to consider the wind speed being halved in one hour.

Since the wind speed is halved in one hour, the time it takes to cover 4 miles will be doubled, which is 60 * 2 = 120 minutes.
Now, to cover 20 miles, it will take 20 / 4 * 120 = 600 minutes.

We need to find out how long it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, which is 20 miles (since 80 miles is the total distance across the city).
Since the fog bank covers 4 miles every 60 minutes, we can find the time it takes to cover 20 miles by dividing 20 by 4.
20 miles / 4 miles per 60 minutes = 5 times the 60-minute interval.
So, it will take 5 * 60 = 300 minutes to cover 20 miles.
However, we are asked for the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, which is 20 miles, but we need to find the time for 1/4 of the city, which is 20 miles. Since the fog bank covers 4 miles every 60 minutes, we can find the time it takes to cover 5 miles (1/4 of 20 miles) by dividing 5 by 4.

If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?",6.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, Santiago watched 4-hour episodes each night, so he watched 2 x 4 = 8 hours of TV on those two nights.

On Friday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. We need to convert the 45-minute show to hours: 45 minutes = 0.75 hours. So, he watched 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours of TV on Friday.

On Saturday, he watched three 2-hour episodes, so he watched 3 x 2 = 6 hours of TV on Saturday.

On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes. We need to convert the 15-minute episodes to hours: 15 minutes = 0.25 hours. So, he watched 3 x 0.25 = 0.75 hours of TV on Sunday.

Now, let's add up the total hours of TV Santiago watched:

8 hours (Tuesday and Wednesday) + 3.75 hours (Friday) + 6 hours (Saturday) + 0.75 hours (Sunday) = 18.5 hours

Santiago watched TV for a total of 20 hours. We need to find out how many 15-minute episodes he watched on Thursday.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours he watched TV on Tuesday and Wednesday:
He watched 4-hour episodes each night, so he watched 4 + 4 = 8 hours on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Next, let's calculate the total number of hours he watched TV on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:
On Thursday, he watched a 15-minute show, which is 0.25 hours (15 minutes / 60 minutes).
On Friday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show, which is 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.
On Saturday, he watched three 2-hour episodes, which is 3 x 2 = 6 hours.
On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes, which is 3 x 0.25 = 0.75 hours.

Now, let's add up the total number of hours he watched TV on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:

If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total hours of TV watched on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, he watched 4-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 hours.
On Friday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. We need to convert the 45-minute show to hours, which is 45/60 = 0.75 hours. So, the total hours watched on Friday is 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.
On Saturday, he watched three 2-hour episodes, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 hours.
On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes. We need to convert this to hours, which is 15/60 = 0.25 hours. So, the total hours watched on Sunday is 3 * 0.25 = 0.75 hours.

She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, and uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

Step 1: Determine the ratio of sugar to water
The ratio of sugar to water is given as 54:27. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 27.

54 ÷ 27 = 2
27 ÷ 27 = 1

So, the simplified ratio of sugar to water is 2:1.

Step 2: Determine the amount of water used
Since the ratio of sugar to water is 2:1, for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, 1 cup of water is used. We are given that Nia used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. Let's assume the number of teaspoons of sugar used is x. Then, the number of cups of water used is x/2.

Step 3: Determine the amount of milk used
We are given that Nia uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water. Since the ratio of sugar to water is 2:1, for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, 1 cup of water is used, which corresponds to 8/8 = 1 cup of water. Therefore, for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, 8 tablespoons of milk are used.

Step 4: Determine the amount of heavy cream used
We are given that Nia uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar.

Step 5: Set up an equation to represent the total amount of ingredients used
The total amount of ingredients used is 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + (x/2) + (8x/2) + (2x) = 240

Simplifying the equation:

x + (x/2) + 4x + 2x = 240

Combine like terms:

9x/2 = 240

Multiply both sides by 2:

9x = 480

Divide both sides by 9:

x = 53.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a teaspoon of sugar, we can round down to the nearest whole number.

x = 53

Therefore, Nia used 53 teaspoons of sugar.",53.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

We are given a complex scenario involving multiple ingredients and their ratios. To approach this problem, we'll break it down into manageable steps.

Nia makes tea using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 54:27. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both parts by 27, resulting in a ratio of 2:1. This means for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 1 cup of water.

So, for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 1 cup of water. 
We are given that the total amount of sugar used is 240 teaspoons.

We can find the number of cups of water used by multiplying the number of teaspoons of sugar by 0.5 (since 2 teaspoons of sugar requires 1 cup of water):
 
Let's find the total number of cups of water used.
Total sugar used = 240 teaspoons
Since 2 teaspoons of sugar uses 1 cup of water, 1 teaspoon of sugar uses 0.5 cups of water.
Total water used = 240 * 0.5 = 120 cups

Now, we are given that Nia uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water. This is a 1:1 ratio. Since she used 120 cups of water, the amount of milk used is the same as the amount of water:
Milk used = 120 tablespoons

We are also given that Nia uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. Since she used 240 teaspoons of sugar, the amount of heavy cream used is twice the amount of sugar:
Heavy cream used = 2 * 240 = 480 tablespoons

Now, we have the total amount of each ingredient used: sugar, water, milk, and heavy cream. We can add these amounts to find the total amount used:
Total = sugar + water + milk + heavy cream
Total = 240 + 120 + 120 + 480 
Total = 960

However, the question asks for the amount of sugar used, not the total. So, our answer is the amount of sugar used:
The answer is 240.",240.0,0,"I'll assume the question about Nia is the one you want me to solve. Here's the step-by-step solution:

Q: Nia makes tea using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 54:27. She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, and uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

A: Let's think step by step.

We are given the ratio of sugar to water is 54:27. Let's find the least common multiple of 54 and 27, which is 54. This means the number of cups of water must be a multiple of 27.
Let's assume the number of cups of water is 27w, where w is a positive integer. Then, the number of teaspoons of sugar is 54w.
We are also given that Nia uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, so the total number of tablespoons of milk is 8w.
Similarly, we are given that she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar, so the total number of tablespoons of heavy cream is 108w.
Since the total is 240, we can write an equation: 27w + 54w + 8w + 108w = 240
Combine like terms: 197w = 240
Divide both sides by 197: w = 1.22 (approximately)
Since w must be an integer, this is not a valid solution.

However, if we look closely, the total number of tablespoons of milk and heavy cream is 8w + 108w = 116w, and the total must be a multiple of 116. The only multiple of 116 that is near 240 is 240. So, we can assume that w is not an integer, but 116w is close to 240. Let's try w = 2.
216w + 54w + 16w + 108w = 394w
394w = 240 is not correct, so we try w = 1.
27w + 54w + 8w + 108w = 197w
197w = 240 is not correct. We try w = 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32.

While Aisha was making the stuffed peppers, she used sixteen of the forks to sample her stuffed peppers, then threw away 6 defective forks. The guests also brought 2 packs of forks, each having 6 inside them. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 32 forks. How many forks were in the package that Aisha bought?",34.0,"To find the number of forks in the package Aisha bought, let's break down the information given:

1. Aisha bought a package of forks (we don't know the number yet).
2. Her husband bought 8 forks and gave them to her.
3. Aisha used 16 forks, threw away 6, and had some left over.
4. The guests brought 2 packs of 6 forks each, so they brought 12 forks.

Now, let's calculate the total number of forks Aisha had after her husband gave her the forks, before any were used or discarded:

Initial forks (Aisha's) + Forks from husband = x + 8

The total number of forks Aisha had before any were used or discarded is x + 8.

Now, she used 16 forks and threw away 6, so the number of forks she had left is x + 8 - 16 + 6 (since the discarded forks were originally hers and her husband's).

Now let's calculate the total number of forks after the guests arrived:

Aisha's remaining forks + Forks from guests = x - 2 + 8 + 12

Since the guests brought 2 packs of 6 forks each, they contributed 12 forks. But Aisha's forks before the guests came were x + 8 - 16 + 6, which is x - 2.

After the guests arrived, Aisha had a total of 32 forks. So, we can set up the equation:

x - 2 + 8 + 12 = 32

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

x + 18 = 32

Subtract 18 from both sides to find the value of x:

x = 32 - 18
x = 14

So, Aisha bought a package of 14 forks.",14.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Aisha's husband gave her 8 forks.
The guests brought 2 packs of forks, each with 6 forks.
So, the number of forks the guests brought is 2 * 6 = 12 forks.

Aisha's guests brought 12 forks and she used 16 forks, so she had some forks left from her husband and from the package she bought. 

The initial number of forks from her husband and the package she bought is unknown. This number is x.

Aisha threw away 6 defective forks, and then she had a total of 32 forks.
So we can set up the equation: x + 8 + 12 - 6 = 32.

Now, let's simplify the equation: x + 14 = 32.

To find x, we need to subtract 14 from both sides of the equation: x = 32 - 14.
x = 18.

The guests also brought 2 packs of forks, each having 6 inside them. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 32 forks. How many forks were in the package that Aisha bought?

A: Let's think step by step.

Aisha starts with an unknown number of forks in the package she bought.
Her husband gives her 8 new forks.
She uses 16 forks to sample the stuffed peppers.
She throws away 6 defective forks.
The guests bring 2 packs of forks, each with 6 forks inside them.
So, the total number of forks is 32.

Let's denote the number of forks in the package Aisha bought as x.

In the span of two years, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?",1764.0,"To find the number of bananas Ravi harvests, we need to find the total area of his banana field that he harvests in two years. 

First, we find the area of his banana field that he harvests every 4 months. Since he harvests every 4 months, he harvests 2 times in a year. So, in a year, he harvests 2 * 10 = 20 square yards. 

Since he harvests 2 times in a year, in 2 years, he harvests 2 * 20 = 40 square yards. 

Now, we find the number of bananas he harvests in 40 square yards. Since there are 36 bananas per 4/5 square yard, we need to find the number of 4/5 square yards in 40 square yards. 

To do this, we divide 40 by 4/5. 

40 / (4/5) = 40 * (5/4) = 50 

So, there are 50 * 36 = 1800 bananas in 40 square yards. 

Now, we find the number of apricots Ravi harvests. 

Since he has a 13-square yard apricot field, and he harvests every 4 months, he harvests 2 times in a year. So, in a year, he harvests 2 * 13 = 26 square yards. 

Since he harvests 2 times in a year, in 2 years, he harvests 2 * 26 = 52 square yards. 

Since there are 12 apricots per square yard, the total number of apricots he harvests is 52 * 12 = 624. 

Now, we find the difference between the number of bananas and apricots he harvests. 

624 - 1800 = -1176 

So, Ravi harvests 1176 fewer apricots than bananas.",1176.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Ravi has 10 square yards of a banana field.

He can harvest the bananas every 4 months. Since there are 12 months in a year, in one year, he can harvest the bananas 3 times (12 / 4 = 3).
In two years, he can harvest the bananas 6 times (3 * 2 = 6).

There are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard.
So, there are 36 * 5 = 180 bananas per square yard (since the area is 5/4 * 1 = 1.25 and 1/0.8 = 1.25).
In one harvesting, Ravi gets 180 * 10 = 1800 bananas (180 bananas per square yard * 10 square yards).
In two years, Ravi gets 1800 * 6 = 10800 bananas (1800 bananas per year * 6 years).

Ravi owns a 13-square yard apricot field.

He can harvest the apricots every 4 months. Since there are 12 months in a year, in one year, he can harvest the apricots 3 times (12 / 4 = 3).
In two years, he can harvest the apricots 6 times (3 * 2 = 6).

The apricots can be harvested every 4 months. 
There are 12 apricots per square yard.
In one harvesting, Ravi gets 12 * 13 = 156 apricots.
In two years, Ravi gets 156 * 6 = 936 apricots.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is 225/400 = 0.5625.
The probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is 10000/160000 = 0.0625.

To find the difference in percentage points, we subtract the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row.
Diff = 0.5625 - 0.0625 = 0.5

To express the difference as a percentage, we multiply the difference by 100.
0.5 * 100 = 50%

So, Yusuf is 50% more likely to roll a number greater than 5 twice in a row than to roll four even numbers in a row.",5.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row. 

The die has 20 sides, but only 10 of them (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20) are greater than 5. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is 1/2 or 50%.

Since the die rolls are independent events, the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is (50% * 50%) = 25%.

Now, let's find the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row.

There are 5 even numbers on a 20-sided die (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20), so the probability of rolling an even number is 10/20 = 1/2 or 50%.

The probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is (50% * 50% * 50% * 50%) = 6.25%.

Now we need to find the difference in percentage points between rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row and rolling four even numbers in a row.

The difference in percentage points is 25% - 6.25% = 18.75%.

The answer is 18.75%.",18.75,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Yusuf is rolling a twenty-sided die. He wants to roll a number greater than 5 twice in a row or roll four even numbers in a row. 

Let's calculate the probability of each event.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a single roll is 10/20 = 1/2, since there are 10 numbers greater than 5 (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20) out of 20 possibilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 10/20 = 1/2, since there are 10 even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20) out of 20 possibilities.

The probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16.

Now, let's find the difference in percentage points.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is 1/4 or 25%.
The probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is 1/16 or 6.25%.

The difference in percentage points is 25% - 6.25% = 18.75%.

However, this is not the answer we're looking for. We want to know how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 5 twice in a row than to roll four even numbers in a row. To find this, we need to subtract the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row.

So, the difference in probability is 25% - 6.25% = 18.75%.

To convert the probability difference to a percentage point difference, we need to convert the probability to a decimal and multiply by 100.

The probability difference is 18.75% = 0.1875.

To convert this to a percentage point difference, we need to multiply by 100.

The percentage point difference is 0.1875 * 100 = 18.75%.

However, this is not the correct answer. The percentage point difference should be a whole number.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is 25% or 0.25.
The probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is 6.25% or 0.0625.

The difference in probability is 0.25 - 0.0625 = 0.1875.

To convert this to a percentage point difference, we need to divide by the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row.

The percentage point difference is (0.1875 / 0.0625) * 100 = 300%.

However, this is still not the correct answer.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is 25% or 0.25.
The probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is 6.25% or 0.0625.

The difference in probability is 0.25 - 0.0625 = 0.1875.

To convert this to a percentage point difference, we need to divide by the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row and multiply by 100.

The percentage point difference is (0.1875 / 0.0625) * 100 is not the answer we want. To get the answer we want, which is how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 5 twice in a row than to roll four even numbers in a row, we should convert 0.1875 to a percentage by dividing 0.1875 by 0.0625 and then dividing that result by 100 and then multiply by 100.

0.1875 / 0.0625 = 3
3 * 100 = 300 

300 / 100 = 3

The answer is 3",3.0,0

Mia then found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. In addition, she saw 24 wasps, and 9 bees. What percentage of animals in the plot were rabbits?",20.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mia found 2/3 as many beetles as bees. Let's say the number of bees is x. Then, the number of beetles is 2/3x.

2. Mia found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. This means the number of rabbits is 26/2 = 13.

3. In addition, she saw 24 wasps and 9 bees. So, the total number of bees and wasps is 24 + 9 = 33.

4. Since the number of beetles is 2/3x, and the number of bees is x, we can set up an equation to find the total number of insects (bees and beetles):

2/3x + x = 33

Combine like terms:

5/3x = 33

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

5x = 99

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 19.8

So, the number of bees is approximately 19.8. The number of beetles is 2/3(19.8) ≈ 13.2.

5. Now, let's find the total number of animals in the plot. We have:
- 13 rabbits
- 33 bees and wasps
- 13.2 beetles (approximately)
- 26 white animals (which are not insects)

The total number of animals is approximately 13 + 33 + 13.2 + 26 = 85.2.

6. To find the percentage of animals that are rabbits, divide the number of rabbits by the total number of animals and multiply by 100:

(13 / 85.2) × 100 ≈ 15.2%

So, approximately 15.2% of the animals in the plot were rabbits.",15.2,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Let's think step by step.
Mia found 2/3 as many beetles as bees. Let's assume the number of bees is x. Then, the number of beetles is 2/3 * x.
She found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. So, the number of rabbits is 26 / 2 = 13.
She also saw 24 wasps and 9 bees. So, the total number of bees and wasps is 24 + 9 = 33.
Since the number of beetles is 2/3 as many as bees, the number of beetles is 2/3 * 33 = 22.
Now, let's find the total number of animals in the plot. The total number of animals is the sum of the number of bees, wasps, beetles, and rabbits. Total animals = 33 + 22 + 13 = 68.
The percentage of animals that are rabbits is the number of rabbits divided by the total number of animals, multiplied by 100. Percentage of rabbits = (13 / 68) * 100 ≈ 19.12%.
However, since the question asks for the percentage of animals that are rabbits, and we know that half of the 26 white animals were rabbits, we can simplify the calculation. The 26 white animals are not necessarily bees or wasps, but since half of them are rabbits, we can assume that the 13 rabbits are part of the 26 white animals. The total number of animals is the sum of the number of bees, wasps, beetles, and the 26 white animals. Total animals = 33 + 22 + 26 = 81.
The percentage of animals that are rabbits is the number of rabbits divided by the total number of animals, multiplied by 100. Percentage of rabbits = (13 / 81) * 100 ≈ 16.05%.
However, since the 26 white animals are not necessarily bees or wasps, but half of them are rabbits, we can simplify the calculation. The total number of animals is the sum of the number of bees, wasps, beetles, and the 26 white animals. Total animals = 33 + 22 + 26 = 81.
The percentage of animals that are rabbits is the number of rabbits divided by the total number of animals, multiplied by 100. Percentage of rabbits = (13 / 81) * 100 ≈ 16.05%.
However, we can simplify the calculation by considering the 26 white animals as a separate group. The percentage of animals that are rabbits is the number of rabbits divided by the total number of animals, multiplied by 100. Percentage of rabbits = (13 / (33 + 22 + 9)) * 100 = (13 / 64) * 100 ≈ 20.31%.
However, we can simplify the calculation by considering the 26 white animals as a separate group. The percentage of animals that are rabbits is the number of rabbits divided by the total number of animals, multiplied by 100. Percentage of rabbits = (13 / (33 + 22 + 9 + 26)) * 100 = (13 / 100) * 100 = 13%.
The answer is 13%.",13.0,0,"Q: Mia went to her greenhouse to pick some blueberries and found 2/3 as many beetles as bees in the plot. Mia then found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. In addition, she saw 24 wasps, and 9 bees. What percentage of animals in the plot were rabbits?

A: Let's think step by step.
Mia found 2/3 as many beetles as bees. Since there are 9 bees, the number of beetles is 2/3 * 9 = 6.
The total number of bees and beetles is 9 + 6 = 15.
Mia also found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. So, the number of rabbits is 26 / 2 = 13.
In addition, she saw 24 wasps.
So, the total number of animals in the plot is 15 + 26 + 24 = 65.
The percentage of animals in the plot that were rabbits is (13 / 65) * 100 = 20%.
However, this is not the answer we're looking for. We want to know what percentage of animals in the plot were rabbits, given that Mia found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits, and 24 wasps, and 9 bees, and 2/3 as many beetles as bees.
We know that the total number of animals in the plot is 65.
We also know that the number of rabbits is 13.
To find the percentage of animals in the plot that were rabbits, we need to divide the number of rabbits by the total number of animals and multiply by 100.
However, we are given that half of the 26 white animals were rabbits. This means that the number of rabbits is 13.
We are also given that the total number of animals in the plot is 65.
We can set up an equation to represent the situation:
Number of rabbits / Total number of animals = Percentage of animals that are rabbits
13 / 65 = Percentage of animals that are rabbits
To convert this to a percentage, we need to multiply by 100:
(13 / 65) * 100 = 20%

Discounted Price = Selling Price - Discount
Discounted Price = $400,000 - $100,000
Discounted Price = $300,000

3. Calculate the brokerage fee:
Brokerage Fee = 5% of the discounted price
Brokerage Fee = 0.05 * $300,000
Brokerage Fee = $15,000

4. Calculate the transfer fee:
Transfer Fee = 12% of the discounted price
Transfer Fee = 0.12 * $300,000
Transfer Fee = $36,000

5. Calculate the total cost:
Total Cost = Discounted Price + Brokerage Fee + Transfer Fee
Total Cost = $300,000 + $15,000 + $36,000
Total Cost = $351,000

6. Find the difference between the total cost and Mrs. Lee's budget:
Difference = Total Cost - Budget
Difference = $351,000 - $340,000
Difference = $11,000

Therefore, the total cost will be $11,000 more than Mrs. Lee's budget.",11000.0,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mrs. Lee's budget is $340,000. 

The selling price of the property is $400,000. She can get a 25% discount on the selling price. 

So, the discount amount is 25% of $400,000, which is 0.25 * 400,000 = $100,000.

The discounted selling price is the original price minus the discount amount: $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000.

On top of the discounted selling price, Mrs. Lee has to pay a brokerage fee, which is 5% of the discounted selling price. This amount is 0.05 * $300,000 = $15,000.

She also has to pay a transfer fee, which is 12% of the discounted selling price. This amount is 0.12 * $300,000 = $36,000.

The total cost of the property will be the discounted selling price plus the brokerage fee and the transfer fee: $300,000 + $15,000 + $36,000 = $351,000.

To find out how much more the total cost will be than Mrs. Lee's budget, we subtract her budget from the total cost: $351,000 - $340,000 = $11,000.

The stocks gained 10% each year for two years. How much were Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years?",80465.0,"To find Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the legal fees:
   The legal fees are 2% of the selling price, which is $550000. 
   So, the legal fees = 2% of $550000 = 0.02 * $550000 = $11000.

2. Calculate the realtor fee:
   The realtor fee is 5% of the selling price, which is $550000. 
   So, the realtor fee = 5% of $550000 = 0.05 * $550000 = $27500.

3. Calculate the total fees:
   The total fees = legal fees + realtor fee = $11000 + $27500 = $38500.

4. Calculate the remaining amount after paying fees:
   The remaining amount = selling price - total fees = $550000 - $38500 = $511500.

5. Calculate the remaining amount after paying the loan:
   The remaining amount = remaining amount - loan amount = $511500 - $440000 = $71500.

6. Calculate the remaining amount after paying closing costs:
   The remaining amount = remaining amount - closing costs = $71500 - $5000 = $66500.

7. Calculate the amount after two years:
   The amount after two years = remaining amount * (1 + 0.10)^2 = $66500 * (1.10)^2 = $66500 * 1.21 = $80265.

So, the amount paid for legal fees is $11000.

He also paid a realtor fee that is 5% of the selling price.
5% of $550000 is 0.05 * 550000 = $27500.

He also paid $440000 for the remaining loan amount on the villa, and $5000 for closing costs.
So, the total amount paid for the loan and closing costs is $440000 + $5000 = $445000.

The total amount paid for legal fees, realtor fees, loan, and closing costs is $11000 + $27500 + $445000 = $470000.

The net proceeds from selling the villa is the selling price minus the total amount paid for fees, loan, and closing costs.

Q: Dr. Brown sold his villa for $550000. He paid the legal fees that amounted to 2% of the selling price and also paid a realtor fee that is 5% of the selling price. He also paid $440000 for the remaining loan amount on the villa, and $5000 for closing costs. Dr. Brown used the net proceeds from selling the villa to invest in stocks. The stocks gained 10% each year for two years. How much were Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years?

A: Let's think step by step.

Dr. Brown starts with a selling price of $550000.

He pays 2% of the selling price for legal fees.
2% of $550000 is 0.02 * $550000 = $11000.
So, the amount deducted for legal fees is $11000.

He also pays 5% of the selling price for a realtor fee.
5% of $550000 is 0.05 * $550000 = $27500.
So, the amount deducted for the realtor fee is $27500.

The total amount deducted for fees is $11000 + $27500 = $38500.

He also pays $440000 for the remaining loan amount on the villa.
And $5000 for closing costs.
So, the total amount deducted is $38500 + $440000 + $5000 = $467500.

The net proceeds from selling the villa is $550000 - $467500 = $82500.

Dr. Brown uses the net proceeds to invest in stocks.
The stocks gain 10% each year for two years.
The gain for the first year is 10% of $82500, which is 0.10 * $82500 = $8250.
The new value of the stocks after the first year is $82500 + $8250 = $90750.

The gain for the second year is 10% of $90750, which is 0.10 * $90750 = $9075.
The new value of the stocks after the second year is $90750 + $9075 = $99625.

Now, let's find the total number of puppies from all the dogs.
Jamal's dog has 131 puppies.
Gabriel's dog has 47 puppies.
Yuki has 54 dogs, each having 13 puppies.

Jamal's dog has 23 puppies with spots.
Gabriel's dog has 13 puppies with spots.
Yuki's dogs have 702 puppies with spots.

Now, let's find the percentage of puppies with spots.
The total number of puppies with spots is 738.
The total number of puppies is 880.

So, the percentage of puppies with spots is (738 / 880) * 100 = 83.86%.

However, we need to consider the puppies from Jamal's dog that were discovered to have spots after the vet visit. Half of the unspotted puppies have spots, so the number of puppies with spots from Jamal's dog increases by half of 108 (which is the number of unspotted puppies).

Half of 108 is 54, so the number of puppies with spots from Jamal's dog increases by 54.

The new total number of puppies with spots is 738 + 54 = 792.

   - Percentage = 0.6 * 100
   - Percentage = 60%

**Shark 2:**

1. Calculate the total length of the remoras on Shark 2:
   - Each remora is 8 inches long.
   - There are 6 remoras.
   - Total length of remoras = 6 * 8 = 48 inches
   - Convert the length of the shark to inches: 10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches
   - Now, calculate the percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras:
   - Percentage = (Total length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100
   - Percentage = (48 / 120) * 100
   - Percentage = 0.4 * 100
   - Percentage = 40%

Therefore, the percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras is 60% for Shark 1 and 40% for Shark 2.",2.0,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the 40-foot shark.

The 40-foot shark has 18 remoras, each 16 inches long. We need to convert the shark's length from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

40 feet * 12 inches/foot = 480 inches

Now, let's calculate the total length of the remoras:

18 remoras * 16 inches/remora = 288 inches

Since the remoras swam away, we need to calculate the number of remoras left:

18 remoras - (1/6) * 18 remoras = 18 - 3 = 15 remoras

The length of the remoras left is:

15 remoras * 16 inches/remora = 240 inches

Now, let's calculate the percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras:

(240 inches / 480 inches) * 100% ≈ 50%

Next, let's calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the 10-foot shark.

The 10-foot shark has 6 remoras, each 8 inches long. We need to convert the shark's length from feet to inches:

10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

The total length of the remoras is:

6 remoras * 8 inches/remora = 48 inches

Now, let's calculate the percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras:

(48 inches / 120 inches) * 100% ≈ 40%

To find the average percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras, we can take the average of the two percentages:

(50% + 40%) / 2 ≈ 45%

Carlos has 720 almonds, 7 bowls and 3 tables. Unfortunately, 2 tables break. Carlos then eats one-fifth of all the almonds. How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?",14.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Initial Situation**

* Carlos has 720 almonds.
* He has 7 bowls, each holding 24 almonds, so the total capacity of the bowls is: 7 x 24 = 168 almonds.
* He has 3 tables, each holding 3 times the capacity of a bowl, so each table holds 3 x 24 = 72 almonds. The total capacity of the tables is: 3 x 72 = 216 almonds.

**After 2 tables break**

* The capacity of the tables is reduced by 2 tables, so the new capacity of the tables is: 216 - 2 x 72 = 216 - 144 = 72 almonds.
* The total capacity of the bowls and tables is now: 168 + 72 = 240 almonds.

**After Carlos eats one-fifth of the almonds**

* Carlos eats one-fifth of the almonds, which is: 720 / 5 = 144 almonds.
* The remaining almonds are: 720 - 144 = 576 almonds.

**Remaining capacity**

* The total capacity of the bowls and tables is 240 almonds.
* To find out how many more almonds can be placed, we subtract the remaining capacity from the total remaining almonds: 576 - 240 = 336 almonds.

**Number of bowls needed**

* Each bowl can hold 24 almonds.
* To find out how many bowls are needed to place the remaining almonds, we divide the remaining capacity by the capacity of each bowl: 336 / 24 = 14 bowls.

Since Carlos already has 7 bowls, he needs: 14 - 7 = 7 more bowls.

The final answer is: 7",7.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Carlos starts with 720 almonds.

Each table can hold three times as many almonds as a bowl, so each table can hold 24 * 3 = 72 almonds.

Initially, Carlos has 7 bowls and 3 tables. The total capacity of the bowls is 7 * 24 = 168 almonds. The total capacity of the tables is 3 * 72 = 216 almonds.

So, the total capacity of all the bowls and tables is 168 + 216 = 384 almonds.

Since Carlos has 720 almonds, he can fill the bowls and tables completely, and he will have 720 - 384 = 336 almonds left.

Unfortunately, 2 tables break, so Carlos now has 1 table left. The table can hold 72 almonds.

The total capacity of the bowls is still 168 almonds. The total capacity of the remaining table is 72 almonds.

So, the total capacity of all the bowls and the remaining table is 168 + 72 = 240 almonds.

Carlos has 336 almonds left, so he can fill the bowls and the remaining table completely, and he will have 336 - 240 = 96 almonds left.

Carlos then eats one-fifth of all the almonds. One-fifth of 720 almonds is 720 / 5 = 144 almonds.

So, Carlos eats 144 almonds, and he has 720 - 144 = 576 almonds left.

The total capacity of the bowls is 168 almonds, and the total capacity of the remaining table is 72 almonds.

The total capacity of all the bowls and the remaining table is 168 + 72 = 240 almonds.

Carlos has 576 almonds left, so he needs 576 - 240 = 336 almonds more to fill the bowls and the remaining table.

Since each bowl can hold 24 almonds, Carlos needs 336 / 24 = 14 more bowls.

1. Diego is 19 years old now.
2. In 9 years, Aisha will be 2 times as old as Diego is now. So, in 9 years, Aisha will be 2 x 19 = 38 years old.
3. Diego's brother, Esteban, is 6 years younger than Diego, so Esteban is 19 - 6 = 13 years old now.
4. Aisha's sister, Nadia, is 10 years older than Esteban, so Nadia is 13 + 10 = 23 years old now.

First, we need to find out how old Aisha, Esteban, and Nadia are now.

Diego is 19 years old.

Esteban is 6 years younger than Diego, so Esteban is 19 - 6 = 13 years old.

Nadia is 10 years older than Esteban, so Nadia is 13 + 10 = 23 years old.

Now, let's find out how old Aisha will be in 9 years. In 9 years, Aisha will be 2 times as old as Diego is now, so Aisha will be 2 * 19 = 38 years old in 9 years.

Now, let's find out how old Aisha is now. Since Aisha will be 38 in 9 years, Aisha is currently 38 - 9 = 29 years old.

- 1 shawl (5 skeins)
- 1 sweater (6 skeins)
- 1 poncho (8 skeins)
- 1 pair of gloves (8 skeins)
- 1 pair of mittens (14 skeins)

Total skeins per grandchild = 5 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 14 = 41 skeins

Since there are 4 grandchildren, the total number of skeins required for all of them is:
41 skeins/grandchild * 4 grandchildren = 164 skeins

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of skeins required for Keisha's warm jackets**

Keisha wants to make 2 warm jackets, each needing 8 skeins of wool.
Total skeins for Keisha's jackets = 2 jackets * 8 skeins/jacket = 16 skeins

- 2 pairs of mittens (2 x 14 = 28 skeins)

Total skeins needed for each grandchild = 5 + 6 + 8 + 16 + 28 = 63 skeins

Since there are 4 grandchildren, the total skeins needed for all of them = 4 x 63 = 252 skeins

For herself, Keisha needs 2 warm jackets, each requiring 8 skeins of wool. So, she needs 2 x 8 = 16 skeins.

Total skeins needed for Keisha = 252 + 16 = 268 skeins

Each dozen skeins of wool costs $7. Since Keisha needs 268 skeins, we need to find out how many dozens she needs. 

268 skeins / 12 skeins per dozen = 22.33 dozen skeins

How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mohammed buys a week's worth of rice, which is 7 days. He uses 3 kgs of rice per day, so he needs 7 x 3 = 21 kgs of rice.

2. The normal brand of rice costs ¥15 per kg. However, his favorite brand was sold out, and he has to buy the more expensive brand that costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate 20% of ¥15 and add it to ¥15.

20% of ¥15 = (20/100) x ¥15 = ¥3

Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2. How much does Mohammed have to pay?

A: Let's think step by step.

Mohammed needs a week's worth of rice, which is 3 kgs per day * 7 days = 21 kgs.

The more expensive brand of rice costs 20% more than the normal brand, which is ¥15 + (20% of ¥15) = ¥15 + ¥3 = ¥18 per kg.

Mohammed needs to buy 21 kgs of rice. Since the store has a 40% discount on rice up to 10 kgs, he will get a discount on the first 10 kgs. The cost of the first 10 kgs is 10 kgs * ¥18 per kg = ¥180. The discount on this amount is 40% of ¥180, which is ¥72. So, the cost of the first 10 kgs after the discount is ¥180 - ¥72 = ¥108.

For the remaining 11 kgs, Mohammed will have to pay the regular price of ¥18 per kg. The cost of the remaining 11 kgs is 11 kgs * ¥18 per kg = ¥198.

The amount of water used for tiny cubes is 12 cubes x 0.25 ounces/cube = 3 ounces.

Now, let's add up the amount of water used for each type of ice cube:

120 ounces (giant) + 60 ounces (medium) + 7 ounces (small) + 3 ounces (tiny) = 190 ounces

Since Leon started with 312 ounces of water, we can subtract the amount of water used from the total amount to find out how much water he has left:

312 ounces - 190 ounces = 122 ounces

So, Leon has 122 ounces of water left.",122.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many ounces of water Leon uses for the giant, medium, and small cubes.

The giant cubes use 12 ounces each, and there are 10 of them.
So, the total ounces used for giant cubes is 10 * 12 = 120.

The medium cubes use 5 ounces each, and there are 12 of them.
So, the total ounces used for medium cubes is 12 * 5 = 60.

The small cubes use 1/2 ounce each, and there are 14 of them.
So, the total ounces used for small cubes is 14 * 0.5 = 7.

Now, let's add up the ounces used for the giant, medium, and small cubes.
120 + 60 + 7 = 187.

Next, we need to find out how many ounces of water Leon uses for the tiny cubes.

We know that Leon makes 48 total ice cubes, including 10 giant cubes, 14 small cubes, and 12 medium cubes.
So, the number of tiny cubes is 48 - 10 - 14 - 12 = 12.

The tiny cubes are half the size of the small cubes, which use 1/2 ounce each.
So, the tiny cubes use 0.25 ounce each (half of 1/2).

The total ounces used for the tiny cubes is 12 * 0.25 = 3.

Now, let's add up the ounces used for all the cubes.
187 + 3 = 190.

Leon started with 312 ounces of water.
So, the number of ounces of water he has left is 312 - 190 = 122.

Let's start by finding the number of students who like to bake. We are told that the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football. Let's call the number of students who like to play football ""x"". Then, the number of students who like to bake is 4x - 3.

We are also given that the number of students who like to play football is 13. So, x = 13.

Now, we can find the number of students who like to bake:
Number of students who like to bake = 4x - 3
= 4(13) - 3
= 52 - 3
= 49

Now, let's find the number of students who like to play video games. We know that the total number of students is 160, and the number of students who like to hike, play chess, swim, and play football is:
69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103

So, the number of students who like to play video games or bake is:
160 - 103 = 57

Now, we can find the number of students who like to play video games:
Number of students who like to play video games = 57 - Number of students who like to bake
= 57 - 49
= 8

Now, we can find the percentage of students who like to play video games:
Percentage of students who like to play video games = (Number of students who like to play video games / Total number of students) x 100

1. We know that 69 students like to hike, 8 like to play chess, 13 like to swim, and 13 like to play football.

2. To find the number of students who like to bake, we need to start by finding the number of students who like to play football. We are given that 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football equals the number of students who like to bake. Let's call the number of students who like football ""x"". Then, the number of students who like to bake is 4x - 3.

3. Since 13 students like to play football, we can substitute this value for x. So, the number of students who like to bake is 4(13) - 3 = 52 - 3 = 49.

4. Now we have the information about the students who like to hike, chess, swim, football, and bake: 69 + 8 + 13 + 13 + 49 = 152. This is the total number of students with the mentioned hobbies.

Oliver has also applied for help from the local charity, which has decided to cover 1/10 of the remaining cost of the workshop. How much money is Oliver still missing?",113.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the workshop for 2 days**

Hotel cost for 2 days: ₣100/day × 2 days = ₣200
Transportation cost for 2 days: ₣10/day × 2 days = ₣20
Since Oliver's friends are covering the food cost, we don't need to add that to the total cost.

Total cost of the workshop: ₣200 (hotel) + ₣20 (transportation) = ₣220

**Step 2: Calculate the remaining cost after Oliver's friends cover the food**

Since Oliver's friends are covering the food cost, we subtract the food cost from the total cost:
₣220 (total cost) - ₣20 (food cost) = ₣200

**Step 3: Calculate the amount covered by the local charity**

The local charity will cover 1/10 of the remaining cost:
₣200 (remaining cost) × 1/10 = ₣20

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining cost after the local charity's contribution**

₣200 (remaining cost) - ₣20 (charity's contribution) = ₣180

**Step 5: Calculate how much money Oliver is still missing**

Oliver has ₣85, and the remaining cost is ₣180. To find out how much he is still missing, we subtract the amount he has from the remaining cost:
₣180 (remaining cost) - ₣85 (Oliver's money) = ₣95

Oliver needs to cover the cost of the workshop for 2 days. The cost for each day is:

So, the total cost for each day is ₣100 + ₣20 + ₣10 = ₣130.

Since the workshop is for 2 days, the total cost is 2 * ₣130 = ₣260.

Oliver has ₣85, but his friends have covered the cost of the food, so he only needs to cover the cost of the hotel and transportation for 2 days, which is ₣130.

However, the local charity will cover 1/10 of the remaining cost, which is 1/10 of ₣130, which is ₣13.

**Cost of 4 loaves of bread:**
1 loaf of bread costs €5, so 4 loaves of bread cost:
4 x €5 = €20

**Cost of 8 bagels:**
The cost of a bagel is one-fourth of a loaf of bread, which is:
€5 / 4 = €1.25 per bagel
So, 8 bagels cost:
8 x €1.25 = €10

However, since the bakery has a promotion that offers a 20% discount on bagels when buying 7 or more, we need to calculate the cost of 8 bagels with the discount.

**Cost of 8 bagels with discount:**

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's find the cost of 8 bagels. Since the cost of a bagel is one-fourth of a loaf of bread, the cost of a bagel is €5 / 4 = €1.25.

The cost of 8 bagels is 8 * €1.25 = €10.

Since the bakery has a promotion that gives a 20% discount on bagels when buying 7 or more, we need to calculate the discount first. The discount is 20% of €10, which is €10 * 0.2 = €2.

So, the cost of 8 bagels with the discount is €10 - €2 = €8.

Now, let's find the cost of 4 loaves of bread. The cost of 4 loaves of bread is 4 * €5 = €20.

To find out how much more 4 loaves of bread cost than 8 bagels, we subtract the cost of 8 bagels from the cost of 4 loaves of bread: €20 - €8 = €12.

Jamal starts with $80 and wants 10 gallons of paint, each priced at $7.0, and 3 carpenter pencils, each costing $2. The store offers a 10% discount on paint for members. How much more money does Elena have left than Jamal after they leave the store?",8.0,"To find out how much money Elena and Jamal have left, we'll calculate their purchases and then subtract their initial amounts from the total spent.

Elena's Purchases:

1. 15 anchors: 15 * $0.26 = $3.90
2. 9 nails: 9 * $0.61 = $5.49
3. 10 gallons of paint: The price is not given, but since the discount is for members, we'll calculate the non-member price and then subtract the discount. Normally, 10 gallons of paint = 10 * $7.0 = $70. However, we need to calculate the non-member price to accurately calculate the discount. Since we do not have the non-member price, we will assume the non-member price for paint is also $70 (it is not stated in the prompt, and a discount is only described for the member price). The discount for paint is 10%. The member price for 10 gallons of paint is $70 * (100% - 10%) = $70 * 0.90 = $63. We'll use the $70 price to keep the original prompt's context.

So, Elena's total non-member paint price is $70, but the member price is $63 for 10 gallons of paint. We have two prices here. The non-member total is $3.90 + $5.49 + $70 = $79.39. The member total is $3.90 + $5.49 + $63 = $72.39.

Elena has $98.39. If she bought non-member paint, she has: $98.39 - $79.39 = $19.00 left. If she bought member paint, she has $98.39 - $72.39 = $26.00 left.

Jamal's Purchases:

1. 10 gallons of paint (member price): 10 * $7.0 * 0.90 (10% discount) = 10 * $6.30 = $63
2. 3 carpenter pencils: 3 * $2 = $6

Jamal starts with $80. His total is $63 + $6 = $69. So, he has $80 - $69 = $11 left.

Comparing the amounts after they leave the store:

If Elena bought non-member paint, she has $19.00 left and Jamal has $11.00 left.
If Elena bought member paint, she has $26.00 left and Jamal has $11.00 left.

In both scenarios, Elena has more money left than Jamal after they leave the store, with a difference of $8 or $15.",15.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

She also buys 9 nails for $0.61 each. 
So, the cost of the nails is 9 * 0.61 = 5.49.
She buys 10 gallons of paint. 
The price of paint is $7.0 per gallon, so the total cost of paint is 10 * 7.0 = 70.00.
However, since Elena is not a member, she does not get the 10% discount. 
So, she pays full price for the paint, which is $70.00.
The total cost for Elena is 3.90 + 5.49 + 70.00 = 79.39.
Now, Elena has 98.39 - 79.39 = 19.00 left.

Jamal starts with $80. 
He buys 10 gallons of paint at the member price. 
Since there is a 10% discount, he gets a discount of 10% of 70.00, which is 0.1 * 70 = 7.00.
So, the cost of the paint for Jamal is 70.00 - 7.00 = 63.00.
He also buys 3 carpenter pencils for $2 each.

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct,"Faisal is selling muffins and apricot pies for a fundraiser. On Wednesday, he sold 27 boxes of muffin and 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie, than on Thursday. On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday and 21 boxes of apricot pie. On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?",796.0,"To find the average daily earning, we need to calculate Faisal's total earnings over the 3 days and then divide that by 3. 

Let's break it down step by step:

Wednesday:
- Muffin boxes sold: 27
- Apricot pie boxes sold: 27 - 13 = 14

Thursday:
- Muffin boxes sold: 27 + 11 = 38
- Apricot pie boxes sold: 21

Total items sold on Wednesday: 27 + 14 = 41
Total items sold on Thursday: 38 + 21 = 59
Total items sold over the two days: 41 + 59 = 100

Since Faisal sold as much as he did in the past two days combined on Friday, he sold 100 boxes on Friday.

Friday:
- Muffin boxes sold: 100 - 27 - 38 = 35
- Apricot pie boxes sold: 100 - 41 - 59 = 0 (he sold 0 pies because he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined)

Total items sold on Friday: 35 + 0 = 35

Now, let's calculate Faisal's total earnings:
- Total muffins sold: 27 + 38 + 35 = 100
- Total apricot pies sold: 14 + 21 + 0 = 35

Total earnings:
- Muffin earnings: 100 * ₺9 = ₺900
- Apricot pie earnings: 35 * ₺21 = ₺735
- Total earnings: ₺900 + ₺735 = ₺1635

Since there are 3 days, let's divide the total earnings by 3:
₺1635 ÷ 3 = ₺545

Faisal's average daily earnings are ₺545.",545.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of boxes of muffins and apricot pies sold on Thursday.

On Wednesday, Faisal sold 27 boxes of muffins.
He sold 11 more boxes of muffins on Thursday than on Wednesday.
So, he sold 27 + 11 = 38 boxes of muffins on Thursday.

He sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie on Wednesday than on Thursday.
Let's call the number of boxes of apricot pie sold on Thursday 'x'.
Since he sold 13 fewer boxes on Wednesday, the number of boxes of apricot pie sold on Wednesday is x - 13.
On Thursday, he sold 21 boxes of apricot pie.
So, x - 13 + 21 = x, which means there is no change in the number of apricot pie boxes sold on Thursday as we were given 21 boxes for Thursday.
However, we know he sold 21 on Thursday, so the equation to find out the number of boxes sold on Wednesday for apricot is x - 13 = 21 - 21 
Now, let's calculate. 
x - 13 = 0 
x = 13

So, he sold 13 boxes of apricot pie on Wednesday.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings on Wednesday.

He sold 27 boxes of muffins at ₺9 each.
The total earnings from muffins on Wednesday is 27 * 9 = ₺243.

He sold 13 boxes of apricot pie at ₺21 each.
The total earnings from apricot pie on Wednesday is 13 * 21 = ₺273.

The total earnings on Wednesday is ₺243 + ₺273 = ₺516.

On Thursday, he sold 38 boxes of muffins at ₺9 each.
The total earnings from muffins on Thursday is 38 * 9 = ₺342.

He sold 21 boxes of apricot pie at ₺21 each.
The total earnings from apricot pie on Thursday is 21 * 21 = ₺441.

The total earnings on Thursday is ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783.

On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined.
So, the total earnings on Friday is ₺516 + ₺783 = ₺1299.

The average daily earning is the total earnings divided by the number of days, which is ₺1299 / 3 = ₺433.

The answer is ₺433.",433.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Faisal's sales on Wednesday and Thursday are as follows:
On Wednesday, he sold 27 boxes of muffins and 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie than on Thursday. Let's denote the number of apricot pie boxes sold on Thursday as x. Then, the number of apricot pie boxes sold on Wednesday is x - 13.
On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday, which is 27 + 11 = 38 boxes of muffins.
He also sold 21 boxes of apricot pie on Thursday.

So, the total number of muffin boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday is 27 + 38 = 65.
The total number of apricot pie boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday is (x - 13) + 21 = x + 8.

We know that the total number of muffin boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday is 65, and the total number of apricot pie boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday is x + 8. However, we don't know the value of x yet.

On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. This means that the total number of muffin boxes sold on Friday is 65, and the total number of apricot pie boxes sold on Friday is x + 8.

Since the total number of muffin boxes sold on Friday is 65, and the cost of each muffin is ₺9, the total revenue from muffin sales on Friday is 65 * 9 = ₺585.

The total number of apricot pie boxes sold on Friday is x + 8. Since the cost of each apricot pie is ₺21, the total revenue from apricot pie sales on Friday is (x + 8) * 21.

The total revenue from both muffin and apricot pie sales on Friday is the sum of the revenues from each type of sale, which is 585 + 21(x + 8).

However, we are given that the total revenue from both muffin and apricot pie sales on Friday is equal to the total revenue from both muffin and apricot pie sales on Wednesday and Thursday combined. This means that the total revenue from both muffin and apricot pie sales on Friday is equal to the sum of the revenues from each type of sale on Wednesday and Thursday, which is (65 * 9) + 21(x + 8).

Since the total revenue from both muffin and apricot pie sales on Friday is equal to the total revenue from both muffin and apricot pie sales on Wednesday and Thursday combined, we can set up the equation:

585 + 21(x + 8) = (65 * 9) + 21(x + 8)

Half of the swimmers are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the tournament?",66.0,"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the total number of students in the three groups and then add the accompaniment by cheerleaders.

1. Calculate the number of swimmers: 
50% of 120 students are swimmers. 
50/100 * 120 = 0.5 * 120 = 60 students are swimmers.

2. Since half of the swimmers are absent due to illness, calculate the number of swimmers attending the tournament:
60 / 2 = 30 swimmers are attending the tournament.

3. Calculate the number of students who are either choir members or dancers:
45% of the remaining students (after removing the swimmers) are choir members or dancers.
The remaining students = 120 - 60 = 60 students
45% of 60 students = 0.45 * 60 = 27 students are choir members or dancers.

4. Calculate the total number of students in all three groups:
The total number of students attending the tournament = 30 (swimmers) + 27 (choir members or dancers) = 57 students.

5. Since each group is accompanied by 3 cheerleaders, calculate the total number of cheerleaders:
3 cheerleaders for each group = 3 * 3 = 9 cheerleaders.

6. Calculate the total number of students leaving early to the tournament:

Olga's flowers grow 3meters wide so she needs to leave 12 meters between every plant (including the plants width). Olga already owns 7 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ₣9 at the store. However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",31.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, let's calculate the total space Olga needs to fill with plants. Since she needs to leave 12 meters between each plant, and each plant is 3 meters wide, the total space required for each plant is 3 + 12 = 15 meters.

2. To find out how many plants Olga can fit in her flower bed, we need to divide the length of the flower bed (132 meters) by the space required for each plant (15 meters). 

132 ÷ 15 = 8.8

Since Olga can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 8 plants. However, Olga already owns 7 flowers, so she needs to buy 1 more plant to fill the flower bed.

3. Since Olga is buying more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. The cost of each plant is ₣9, so the total cost without the discount is:

1 plant × ₣9 = ₣9

However, since Olga is buying more than 2 plants, she'll get a ₣5 discount. The total cost with the discount is:

₣9 - ₣5 = ₣4

4. To find the total amount Olga will spend at the store, we need to add the cost of the plant she already owns (₣0, since she already has it) and the cost of the plant she needs to buy (₣4).

Total cost = ₣0 + ₣4 = ₣4

So, Olga will spend ₣4 at the store to fill up her flower bed.",4.0,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Olga has a flower bed that is 132 meters long. She wants to fill it with plants, and each plant grows 3 meters wide. She also needs to leave 12 meters between every plant, including the plant's width.

Let's start by finding out how many plants Olga can fit in her flower bed.

The total length of the flower bed is 132 meters. Each plant grows 3 meters wide, and there needs to be 12 meters between each plant. So, the total space taken up by each plant, including the space between them, is 3 + 12 = 15 meters.

To find out how many plants Olga can fit in her flower bed, we need to divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space taken up by each plant.

So, the number of plants Olga can fit is 132 / 15 = 8.8.

Since Olga can't have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 8 plants in her flower bed.

Olga already owns 7 flowers, so she needs to buy 8 - 7 = 1 more plant.

However, since Olga is buying more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. The cost of each plant is ₣9, so the total cost without the discount is 1 * ₣9 = ₣9.

With the discount, the total cost is ₣9 - ₣5 = ₣4.

The answer is ₣4.",4.0,0,"Let's re-evaluate the problem step by step.

Olga has a flower bed that is 132 meters long. She wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Each plant is 3 meters wide, and she needs to leave 12 meters between each plant, including the plant's width. 

Let's calculate the total space available in the flower bed for the plants and spaces between them.

First, we need to find the total available space in the flower bed. Since we don't know how many plants Olga will buy, let's call the number of plants 'x'. 

1. The total space taken by the plants is 3x (3 meters per plant * x plants).
2. The total space between the plants is 12(x-1) (12 meters between each plant * (x-1) spaces).
3. The total available space in the flower bed is the length of the flower bed (132 meters).
4. We can write the equation for the total available space as: 3x + 12(x-1) = 132.

Now, let's simplify the equation.

3x + 12x - 12 = 132
15x - 12 = 132

Add 12 to both sides of the equation:
15x = 144

Now, let's solve for x.

x = 144 / 15
x = 9.6

Since we cannot have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, the problem indicates that there are 7 plants initially. So, we'll calculate the total available space assuming 7 plants are already planted.

Let's recalculate the total available space if 7 plants are already placed, so x = 7.

1. The total space taken by the new plants is 3(7 - 7) = 0 meters (since the 7 plants are already placed).
2. The total space between the new plants is 12(7 - 1) = 12 * 6 = 72 meters.
3. The available space after 7 plants are placed is 132 - 72 = 60 meters.

For the new plants, we need to consider that each plant is 3 meters wide and there are 12 meters of space between each plant. The total space available for the new plants is 60 meters. So, let's find the number of new plants that can be placed.

Let's denote the number of new plants as 'n'. Then the total space taken by the new plants will be 3n, and the total space between the new plants will be 12(n-1). The total available space for the new plants is 60 meters.

So, we can write the equation for the total available space as: 3n + 12(n-1) = 60.

Now, let's simplify the equation.

3n + 12n - 12 = 60
15n - 12 = 60

Add 12 to both sides of the equation:
15n = 72

Now, let's solve for n.

n = 72 / 15
n = 4.8

Since we cannot have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, since we need to fill the flower bed completely, we'll round up to the nearest whole number.

Let's calculate the number of plants needed to fill the flower bed. 

Olga initially has 7 plants. We rounded up 'n' to 5 to fill the space after the 7 plants are placed. Now, we need to find the total number of plants: 7 (initial plants) + 5 (newly added plants) = 12.

However, the previous plants were already placed, so the number of new plants that need to be bought is 5 - 7 + 7 = 5.",5.0,0

How many minutes will it take her to peel and saute 150 clams if it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam before peeling it? Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.,163.0,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to peel 150 clams**

Olga can peel 6 clams per minute. To find the time it takes to peel 150 clams, we can divide the total number of clams by the number of clams she can peel per minute:

150 clams / 6 clams/minute = 25 minutes

**Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to wash 150 clams**

It takes 12 seconds to wash each clam. To find the total time it takes to wash 150 clams, we can multiply the number of clams by the time it takes to wash each clam:

150 clams x 12 seconds/clam = 1800 seconds

To convert this to minutes, we can divide by 60:

1800 seconds / 60 = 30 minutes

**Step 3: Calculate the total time it takes to peel and wash 150 clams**

We add the time it takes to peel the clams (25 minutes) and the time it takes to wash the clams (30 minutes):

25 minutes + 30 minutes = 55 minutes

**Step 4: Add the 13-minute break**

After peeling the clams, Olga needs to take a 13-minute break before she can start sautéing them. We add this break to the total time:

55 minutes + 13 minutes = 68 minutes

**Step 5: Calculate the time it takes to sauté 150 clams**

It takes Olga 19 minutes to sauté 30 clams. To find the time it takes to sauté 150 clams, we can multiply the time it takes to sauté 30 clams by 5 (since 150 is 5 times 30):

19 minutes x 5 = 95 minutes

**Step 6: Calculate the total time it takes to peel, wash, sauté, and take a break**

We add the time it takes to peel and wash the clams (68 minutes), the time it takes to sauté the clams (95 minutes), and the time it takes to peel the clams (25 minutes, which is already included in the 68 minutes):

68 minutes + 95 minutes = 163 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{163}$",163.0,1,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Olga can peel 6 clams a minute. To find out how long it takes her to peel 150 clams, we need to divide 150 by 6.

Let's think step by step.
Olga can peel 6 clams a minute.
To find out how long it takes her to peel 150 clams, we need to divide 150 by 6.
So, the time it takes to peel 150 clams is 150 / 6 = 25 minutes.
However, we need to consider the time it takes to wash each clam before peeling it. It takes 12 seconds to wash each clam, and there are 150 clams. So, the total time to wash all the clams is 150 * 12 = 1800 seconds. We need to convert this to minutes by dividing by 60. 1800 / 60 = 30 minutes.

So, the total time to peel and wash the clams is 25 + 30 = 55 minutes.

Now, let's consider the time it takes to sauté the clams. Olga can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes. To find out how long it takes her to sauté 150 clams, we need to divide 150 by 30 and then multiply by 19.

Let's think step by step.
Olga can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes.
To find out how long it takes her to sauté 150 clams, we need to divide 150 by 30 and then multiply by 19.
First, we divide 150 by 30 to get 5. Then, we multiply 5 by 19 to get 95 minutes.

However, we need to consider the 13-minute break that Olga needs to take after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them. So, the total time it takes Olga to peel and sauté 150 clams is 55 + 95 + 13 = 163 minutes.

1. Andre picks 177 pineapples on Saturday.
2. He picks 183 pineapples on Sunday.
3. On Monday, he picks double the number of pineapples he did on Saturday.
   - Double of 177 is 177 * 2 = 354 pineapples.
4. The total number of pineapples picked in the first three days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday) is:
   - 177 + 183 + 354 = 714 pineapples.
5. On Tuesday, he picks half the amount of what he picked in the past 3 days combined.

   - 971 / 21 = 46.238 (round down to 46, because we can't have a fraction of a box)
8. Since Andre has 46 full boxes, he can sell these boxes. However, for 46 boxes, he will have 5 pineapples left (971 - 966).
9. Now, to find out how much money Andre is going to make, we multiply the number of boxes by the price per box:

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 50% for the second half. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?",1755.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten per day**

Uncle eats 10 pizzas per day
Spouse eats 20 pizzas per day
Combined number of pizzas eaten per day = 10 + 20 = 30 pizzas

Grandchild eats 2/4 of the combined number of pizzas eaten per day = 2/4 × 30 = 15 pizzas

Total number of pizzas eaten per day = 30 + 15 = 45 pizzas

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten in one month**

There are 30 days in a month. So, the total number of pizzas eaten in one month = 45 pizzas/day × 30 days = 1350 pizzas

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten in the first half of the second month**

The family reduces their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month. So, the new daily consumption = 45 pizzas × (1 - 0.6) = 45 pizzas × 0.4 = 18 pizzas

Total number of pizzas eaten in the first half of the second month = 18 pizzas/day × 15 days = 270 pizzas

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten in the second half of the second month**

The family reduces their food consumption by an additional 50% for the second half of the month. So, the new daily consumption = 18 pizzas × (1 - 0.5) = 18 pizzas × 0.5 = 9 pizzas

Total number of pizzas eaten in the second half of the second month = 9 pizzas/day × 15 days = 135 pizzas

**Step 5: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten in the second month**

Total number of pizzas eaten in the second month = 270 pizzas + 135 pizzas = 405 pizzas

**Step 6: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten in two months**

Total number of pizzas eaten in two months = 1350 pizzas + 405 pizzas = 1755 pizzas

Therefore, the family eats 1755 pizzas in two months.",1755.0,1,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten per day**

The uncle eats 10 pizzas per day.
The spouse eats 20 pizzas per day.
The grandchild eats two-fourths of the combined number of pizzas they eat per day.
The combined number of pizzas eaten by the uncle and spouse is 10 + 20 = 30.
Two-fourths of 30 is (2/4) * 30 = 15.
So, the grandchild eats 15 pizzas per day.
The total number of pizzas eaten per day is 10 + 20 + 15 = 45.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten in one month**

There are 30 days in a month.
The family eats 45 pizzas per day.
So, the total number of pizzas eaten in one month is 45 * 30 = 1350.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten in the first half of the second month**

The family reduces their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month.
60% of 1350 is 0.6 * 1350 = 810.
So, the total number of pizzas eaten in the first half of the second month is 1350 - 810 = 540.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten in the second half of the second month**

The family reduces their food consumption by an additional 50% for the second half of the month.
50% of 1350 is 0.5 * 1350 = 675.
So, the total number of pizzas eaten in the second half of the second month is 1350 - 675 = 675.

**Step 5: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten in two months**

The family eats 1350 pizzas in the first month.
In the second month, they eat 540 pizzas in the first half and 675 pizzas in the second half.
So, the total number of pizzas eaten in the second month is 540 + 675 = 1215.
The total number of pizzas eaten in two months is 1350 + 1215 = 2565.

Q: An uncle eats 10 pizzas per day, his spouse eats 20 pizzas per day, and their grandchild eats two-fourths of the combined number of pizzas they eat per day. After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 50% for the second half. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total number of pizzas the family eats per day.
The uncle eats 10 pizzas per day.
His spouse eats 20 pizzas per day.
Their grandchild eats 2/4 of the combined number of pizzas they eat per day, which is (2/4) * (10 + 20) = (2/4) * 30 = 15 pizzas per day.
So, the total number of pizzas the family eats per day is 10 + 20 + 15 = 45 pizzas per day.

Next, let's calculate the total number of pizzas the family eats in one month.
There are 30 days in a month.
So, the total number of pizzas the family eats in one month is 45 * 30 = 1350 pizzas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pizzas the family eats in two months.
In the first month, the family eats 1350 pizzas.
In the second month, the family reduces their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month.
The first half of the month has 15 days.
So, the family eats 45 * 0.4 = 18 pizzas per day for the first half of the month.
The total number of pizzas the family eats in the first half of the second month is 18 * 15 = 270 pizzas.
In the second half of the month, the family reduces their food consumption by an additional 50%.
The second half of the month has 15 days.
So, the family eats 45 * 0.2 = 9 pizzas per day for the second half of the month.
The total number of pizzas the family eats in the second half of the second month is 9 * 15 = 135 pizzas.
The total number of pizzas the family eats in the second month is 270 + 135 = 405 pizzas.
The total number of pizzas the family eats in two months is 1350 + 405 = 1755 pizzas.

However, I made a mistake earlier. Let's recalculate the total number of pizzas the family eats in the second month.
In the first half of the month, the family eats 18 pizzas per day for 15 days, which is 18 * 15 = 270 pizzas.
In the second half of the month, the family eats 9 pizzas per day for 15 days, which is 9 * 15 = 135 pizzas.
However, the family reduces their food consumption by an additional 50% in the second half of the month, not just for the second half of the month. This means that the family eats 9 pizzas per day for 7.5 days (half of 15 days), which is 9 * 7.5 = 67.5 pizzas.
The total number of pizzas the family eats in the second month is 270 + 67.5 = 337.5 pizzas.
The total number of pizzas the family eats in two months is 1350 + 337.5 = 1687.5 pizzas.

The Sports Arena has space for 9600 people.

After accounting for the seats for graduates, faculty, and staff, we need to subtract the total number of reserved seats from the total capacity.

There are 700 seats for graduates, 450 seats for faculty, and 50 seats for staff. So, the total number of reserved seats is 700 + 450 + 50 = 1200.

Now, let's subtract the reserved seats from the total capacity: 9600 - 1200 = 8400.

Mohammed work overtime on the last day so he can respond to 10% more emails than usual.",61.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of emails that don't require a response**

Mohammed receives 30 emails a day. 20% of those emails don't require a response. To find 20% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.2:

30 x 0.2 = 6

So, 6 emails don't require a response.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of emails that require a response**

Since 6 emails don't require a response, we subtract those from the total number of emails:

30 - 6 = 24

So, 24 emails require a response.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of emails Mohammed can respond to**

From the 24 emails that require a response, Mohammed can respond to 2 less than half of them. To find half of 24, we divide 24 by 2:

24 ÷ 2 = 12

Then, we subtract 2 from that number:

12 - 2 = 10

So, Mohammed can respond to 10 emails.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of emails Mohammed responds to in a 6-day work week**

Since Mohammed can respond to 10 emails per day, we multiply 10 by 6:

10 x 6 = 60

So, Mohammed responds to 60 emails in a 6-day work week.

**Step 5: Calculate the number of emails Mohammed responds to on the last day**

On the last day, Mohammed works overtime and can respond to 10% more emails than usual. To find 10% of 10, we multiply 10 by 0.1:

10 x 0.1 = 1

So, Mohammed can respond to 1 more email on the last day.

**Step 6: Calculate the total number of emails Mohammed responds to in the 6-day work week, including the last day**

We add the number of emails Mohammed responds to in the first 5 days (60) to the number of emails he responds to on the last day (11):

60 + 11 = 71

So, Mohammed responds to 71 emails in the 6-day work week, including the last day.",6.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Mohammed receives 30 emails a day.

20% of those emails don't require any response. 
20% of 30 is 0.20 * 30 = 6 emails.

Mohammed responds to 10 emails per day.
In 6 days, he responds to 10 * 6 = 60 emails.

However, Mohammed works overtime on the last day and can respond to 10% more emails than usual.
10% of 10 is 0.10 * 10 = 1 email.

A: Let's think step by step.

Mohammed receives 30 emails a day.

First, let's calculate the number of emails that don't require any response. 20% of 30 is 0.2 x 30 = 6 emails.

So, the number of emails that require a response is 30 - 6 = 24 emails.

From the rest, Mohammed can only respond to 2 less than the 1/2 of them. Half of 24 is 12, so Mohammed can respond to 12 - 2 = 10 emails per day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of emails Mohammed responds to in a 6 day work week. For the first 5 days, he responds to 10 emails per day, so the total is 5 x 10 = 50 emails.

On the last day, Mohammed works overtime and can respond to 10% more emails than usual. 10% of 30 is 0.1 x 30 = 3 emails. So, he can respond to 10 + 3 = 13 emails on the last day.

Step 2:  We know that she walks 14 miles on the sidewalk at two times the speed on the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk is 2B. 

Step 3:  The total time she spends walking is the total distance divided by the total speed. Since we don't know her speed, we'll express it in terms of B. Her time on the beach is 10/B and her time on the sidewalk is 14/2B = 7/B. The total time is the sum of these two, which is (10/B + 7/B) = 17/B.

Step 4:  We know that 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. Since the time spent on the beach is 10/B, we can equate 10/B to 50 minutes and solve for B. So, 10/B = 50 minutes. 

Step 5:  Now we'll solve for B. Multiply both sides by B to get 10 = 50B. Then, divide both sides by 50 to get B = 10/50 = 1/5 miles per minute. This is Ananya's original speed on the beach.

Step 6:  Since we now know Ananya's original speed on the beach, we can calculate her original time to complete the entire 24-mile walk. The time is the total distance divided by the total speed. The total speed is the sum of the speeds on the beach and the sidewalk, which is B + 2B = 3B. The total time is 24 / (3B) = 24 / (3*1/5) = 24 / (3/5) = 24 * (5/3) = 40 minutes.

However, since Ananya's speed has decreased by half on both the beach and the sidewalk, we need to multiply this time by 2 to get her new time. 

So, her new time to complete the entire 24-mile walk is 40 * 2 = 80 minutes.

The answer is 80 minutes.",80.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Ananya walks 24 miles every day. 
The trail includes 10 miles of walking on the beach and 14 miles of walking on the sidewalk.

First, we need to find out how much time Ananya spends on the beach and the sidewalk. 
We know that 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. 
Since the beach is 10 miles, we can find out her speed on the beach. 
However, we are given that her speed has decreased by half due to an injury. 
So, let's first find out her original speed on the beach.

Let's assume her original speed on the beach is x miles per minute. 
Then, the time she spends on the beach is 10 / x minutes. 
We know that this time is 50 minutes. 
So, 10 / x = 50. 
Solving for x, we get x = 10 / 50 = 0.2 miles per minute.

Now, we know her original speed on the beach is 0.2 miles per minute. 
However, her speed has decreased by half due to an injury. 
So, her current speed on the beach is 0.2 / 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.

Now, we can find out how much time she spends on the beach. 
We know that she walks 10 miles on the beach at a speed of 0.1 miles per minute. 
So, the time she spends on the beach is 10 / 0.1 = 100 minutes.

We know that she spends 50 minutes on the beach, but we calculated that she spends 100 minutes on the beach. 
However, this is the time she would take if she walked at her original speed. 
Since her speed has decreased by half, she actually spends 100 / 2 = 50 minutes on the beach. 
This is consistent with the given information.

Now, let's find out how much time she spends on the sidewalk. 
We know that she walks 14 miles on the sidewalk. 
We also know that she walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. 
So, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.1 = 0.2 miles per minute.

Now, we can find out how much time she spends on the sidewalk. 
We know that she walks 14 miles on the sidewalk at a speed of 0.2 miles per minute. 
So, the time she spends on the sidewalk is 14 / 0.2 = 70 minutes.

We know that she spends 50 minutes on the beach and 70 minutes on the sidewalk. 
So, the total time she spends on the beach and the sidewalk is 50 + 70 = 120 minutes.

We know that she walks 24 miles in total. 
We also know that she spends 120 minutes on the beach and the sidewalk. 
So, the time she spends on the remaining 4 miles is 24 - 14 = 10 miles. 
We know that she walks at a speed of 0.1 miles per minute on the beach. 
So, the time she spends on the remaining 10 miles is 10 / 0.1 = 100 minutes.

However, this is the time she would take if she walked at her original speed on the beach. 
Since her speed has decreased by half, she actually spends 100 / 2 = 50 minutes on the remaining 10 miles. 
But we already know that she spends 50 minutes on the beach. 
So, the time she spends on the remaining 10 miles is actually 100 - 50 = 50 minutes.

Now, we can find out the total time she spends on the entire 24-mile walk. 
We know that she spends 50 minutes on the beach, 70 minutes on the sidewalk, and 50 minutes on the remaining 10 miles. 
So, the total time she spends on the entire 24-mile walk is 50 + 70 + 50 = 170 minutes.

The answer is 170.",170.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Mohammed receives 30 emails a day.

First, let's calculate the number of emails that don't require any response. 20% of 30 is 0.2 x 30 = 6 emails.

So, the number of emails that require a response is 30 - 6 = 24 emails.

From the rest, Mohammed can only respond to 2 less than the 1/2 of them. Half of 24 is 12, so Mohammed can respond to 12 - 2 = 10 emails per day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of emails Mohammed responds to in a 6 day work week. For the first 5 days, he responds to 10 emails per day, so the total is 5 x 10 = 50 emails.

On the last day, Mohammed works overtime and can respond to 10% more emails than usual. 10% of 30 is 0.1 x 30 = 3 emails. So, he can respond to 10 + 3 = 13 emails on the last day.

The total number of emails Mohammed responds to in a 6 day work week is 50 + 13 = 63 emails.

1. Amelia initially had 11 dozen cookies. Since 1 dozen = 12 cookies, Amelia had:

2. Amelia ate 5 cookies for breakfast:
132 cookies - 5 cookies = 127 cookies

3. Elena finds 5 cookies:
127 cookies - 5 cookies = 122 cookies

4. Mei finds twice as many as Elena:
Mei finds 2 x 5 cookies = 10 cookies
122 cookies - 10 cookies = 112 cookies

5. Xavier finds 2 less than Mei:
Xavier finds 10 cookies - 2 cookies = 8 cookies
112 cookies - 8 cookies = 104 cookies

103 cookies - 39 cookies = 64 cookies

Therefore, there are 64 cookies still hidden in the yard.",64.0,1,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Amelia initially had 11 dozen cookies. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, Amelia had 11 * 12 = 132 cookies.

She ate 5 cookies for breakfast, so the number of cookies left is 132 - 5 = 127.

Now, let's consider the cookies found by each person:

Elena finds 5 cookies.

Mei finds twice as many as Elena, which is 2 * 5 = 10 cookies.

Xavier finds 2 less than Mei, which is 10 - 2 = 8 cookies.

Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier, which is 8 / 8 = 1 cookie.

Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined. Since Mei and Elena found 5 + 10 = 15 cookies, Umar finds 2 * 12 = 24 cookies.

Now, let's add up the number of cookies found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 1 + 24 = 48 cookies.

The total number of cookies found is 48.

Xavier finds 2 less than Mei. Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier, and Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined. How many cookies are still hidden in the yard?

A: Let's think step by step.

Amelia starts with 11 dozen cookies, which is 11 x 12 = 132 cookies.

She eats 5 cookies for breakfast, so she has 132 - 5 = 127 cookies left.

Elena finds 5 cookies, so there are 127 - 5 = 122 cookies left.

Mei finds twice as many as Elena, which is 2 x 5 = 10 cookies. So, there are 122 - 10 = 112 cookies left.

Xavier finds 2 less than Mei, which is 10 - 2 = 8 cookies. So, there are 112 - 8 = 104 cookies left.

Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier, which is 8 / 8 = 1 cookie. So, there are 104 - 1 = 103 cookies left.

Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined, which is 2 x 12 = 24 cookies. Mei and Elena found a total of 5 + 10 = 15 cookies, so Umar finds 24 + 15 = 39 cookies. However, this is incorrect, as Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined, which is 2 x 12 = 24 cookies. Umar finds 24 cookies, not 39. So, there are 103 - 24 = 79 cookies left.

   Apartments in the first 2 complexes = 100 + 100 = 200

2. Calculate the total number of apartments in the last complex:
   The last complex is 35% bigger than the other 2 combined.

The first 2 apartment complexes have 100 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these two complexes is 2 * 100 = 200.

The last apartment complex is 35% bigger than the other 2 combined. To find the number of apartments in the last complex, we need to calculate 35% of 200 and add it to 200.

35% of 200 is 0.35 * 200 = 70.

So, the last complex has 200 + 70 = 270 apartments.

Now, let's find the total number of apartments in all three complexes: 200 + 270 = 470.

In the next 10 seconds, the popping rate increases to 4 times the initial rate, which is 4 * 70 = 280 kernels.

In the final 10 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the past 10 seconds, which is 280 / 2 = 140 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels that popped in the first 40 seconds is 70 + 140 + 280 + 140 = 530 kernels.

= 0.5 x 100
= 50%

Therefore, 50% of the bricks in the building are green.",50.0,1,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Let's think step by step.
The building has 5 white bricks.
There are twice as many orange bricks as white bricks, so there are 5 * 2 = 10 orange bricks.
The total number of white and orange bricks is 5 + 10 = 15.
There are 30 bricks in the building in total.
So, the number of green bricks is 30 - 15 = 15.
To find the percentage of green bricks, we need to divide the number of green bricks by the total number of bricks and multiply by 100.
The percentage of green bricks is (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.
The answer is 50%.",50.0,1,,50.0,1
gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct,"Olivia, Bodhi are currently 24 years apart in age. Olivia and Keisha are currently 15 years apart. Olivia, who is younger than Bodhi but older than Keisha, will be 42 in 7 years. How much younger is Keisha than the average age of all three?",18.0,"## Step 1: Determine Olivia's current age
Since Olivia will be 42 in 7 years, we need to subtract 7 from 42 to find her current age. Olivia's current age = 42 - 7 = 35.

## Step 2: Determine Bodhi's current age
We know that Olivia and Bodhi are 24 years apart in age. Since Olivia is 35, we can add 24 to her age to find Bodhi's age. Bodhi's current age = 35 + 24 = 59.

## Step 3: Determine Keisha's current age
We know that Olivia and Keisha are 15 years apart in age. Since Olivia is 35, we can subtract 15 from her age to find Keisha's age. Keisha's current age = 35 - 15 = 20.

## Step 4: Calculate the average age of all three
To find the average age, we need to add up the ages of Olivia, Bodhi, and Keisha and then divide by 3. Average age = (35 + 59 + 20) / 3 = 114 / 3 = 38.

## Step 5: Find the difference between Keisha's age and the average age
To find out how much younger Keisha is than the average age, we need to subtract her age from the average age. Difference = Average age - Keisha's age = 38 - 20 = 18.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$",18.0,1,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Olivia will be 42 in 7 years, so her current age is 42 - 7 = 35 years.

Since Olivia is 24 years apart in age from Bodhi, Bodhi's current age is 35 + 24 = 59 years.

Olivia is 15 years apart in age from Keisha, so Keisha's current age is 35 - 15 = 20 years.

To find the average age of all three, we need to add their ages and divide by 3: (35 + 59 + 20) / 3 = 114 / 3 = 38 years.

Keisha is 20 years old, and the average age of all three is 38 years. To find out how much younger Keisha is than the average age, we subtract her age from the average age: 38 - 20 = 18 years.

The answer is 18.",18.0,1,,18.0,1
