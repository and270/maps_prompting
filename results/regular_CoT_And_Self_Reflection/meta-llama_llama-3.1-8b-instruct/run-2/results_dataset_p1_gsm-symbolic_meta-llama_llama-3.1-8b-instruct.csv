She bought 6 dozen croissants which cost $19 per dozen, 4 dozen macarons which cost $77 per dozen, and 3 dozen brownies for $118 per dozen. How much was the total cost if she received 25% discount on all purchases?",582.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of each item**

* 6 dozen croissants at $19 per dozen: 6 x $19 = $114
* 4 dozen macarons at $77 per dozen: 4 x $77 = $308
* 3 dozen brownies at $118 per dozen: 3 x $118 = $354

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost before discount**

Add up the costs of all the items: $114 + $308 + $354 = $776

**Step 3: Calculate the discount**

Beatriz received a 25% discount on all purchases. To calculate the discount, multiply the total cost by 0.25 (which is the same as 25%): $776 x 0.25 = $194

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost after discount**

Subtract the discount from the total cost: $776 - $194 = $582

Therefore, the total cost of Beatriz's purchases after the 25% discount is $582.",582.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the baked goods before the discount.

Beatriz bought 6 dozen croissants at $19 per dozen.
So, the cost of the croissants is 6 * $19 = $114.

She bought 4 dozen macarons at $77 per dozen.
So, the cost of the macarons is 4 * $77 = $308.

She bought 3 dozen brownies at $118 per dozen.
So, the cost of the brownies is 3 * $118 = $354.

The total cost before the discount is $114 + $308 + $354 = $776.

Now, let's calculate the discount. Beatriz received a 25% discount on all purchases.
So, the discount amount is 25% of $776, which is 0.25 * $776 = $194.

The total cost after the discount is $776 - $194 = $582.

But as I pour it, I spill 7 liters of the mango drink. To make up for that, I add 7 liters of water to the mix. What percentage of the final mix is water?",50.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Initial amounts:**

* Mango drink: 16 liters (1/9 water)
* Apple drink: 14 liters (1/2 water)

**Spill and add water:**

* You spill 7 liters of mango drink, so you have:
	+ 16 - 7 = 9 liters of mango drink left
* You add 7 liters of water to make up for the spill, so the total amount of water added is 7 liters.

**New amounts:**

* Mango drink: 9 liters (1/9 water)
* Apple drink: 14 liters (1/2 water)
* Water added: 7 liters

**Calculate the amount of water in each drink:**

* Mango drink: 9 liters * (1/9) = 1 liter of water
* Apple drink: 14 liters * (1/2) = 7 liters of water

**Total amount of water:**

* 1 liter (mango drink) + 7 liters (apple drink) + 7 liters (added water) = 15 liters of water

**Total final mix:**

* 9 liters (mango drink) + 14 liters (apple drink) + 7 liters (added water) = 30 liters

**Percentage of water in the final mix:**

* (15 liters of water / 30 liters of total mix) * 100% ≈ 50%

So, the final mix is approximately 50% water.",50.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

I start with 16 liters of mango drink, which is one-ninth water.
Since 16 liters is one-ninth water, the total amount of water in it is 16 / 9.
So, the amount of water in the mango drink is 16 / 9 = 1.78 liters (approximately).

The amount of non-water in the mango drink is 16 - 1.78 = 14.22 liters.

I then add it to 14 liters of apple drink that is one-half water.
Since 14 liters is one-half water, the total amount of water in it is 14 / 2 = 7 liters.

The amount of non-water in the apple drink is 14 - 7 = 7 liters.

The total non-water in the mixture is 14.22 + 7 = 21.22 liters.

I spill 7 liters of the mango drink, leaving me with 16 - 7 = 9 liters of the mango drink and 14 liters of apple drink.

Let's calculate the new total amount of water and non-water.

The amount of water from the mango drink is 9 / 9 = 1 liter.
The amount of water from the apple drink is 14 / 2 = 7 liters.
The total amount of water is 1 + 7 = 8 liters.

Now, I add 7 liters of water to make up for the spill.
The total amount of water is 8 + 7 = 15 liters.

The total amount of the mixture is 9 liters of mango drink + 14 liters of apple drink + 7 liters of water = 30 liters.

If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 10 hours if she spends 2/5 of the time running, 1/2 of the time skipping, and the remaining of the time walking?",27.0,"To solve this problem, we need to find Mei's walking speed and running speed first.

Given that Mei can skip at 2 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is 1/2 as fast as her running speed, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2.

Running speed = 2 * 2 = 4 miles per hour

Since Mei can run four times faster than she can walk, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4.

Walking speed = 4 / 4 = 1 mile per hour

Now, we know Mei's walking speed (1 mile per hour), running speed (4 miles per hour), and skipping speed (2 miles per hour).

Mei spends 2/5 of the time running, 1/2 of the time skipping, and the remaining time walking. The total time is 10 hours.

Time spent running = 2/5 * 10 = 4 hours
Time spent skipping = 1/2 * 10 = 5 hours
Time spent walking = 10 - (4 + 5) = 1 hour

Now, we can find the distance Mei travels in each mode of transportation:

Distance traveled running = Speed * Time = 4 * 4 = 16 miles
Distance traveled skipping = Speed * Time = 2 * 5 = 10 miles
Distance traveled walking = Speed * Time = 1 * 1 = 1 mile

Finally, we can find the total distance Mei travels in 10 hours by adding the distances traveled in each mode of transportation.

Total distance = 16 + 10 + 1 = 27 miles

Therefore, Mei can travel 27 miles in 10 hours.",10.0,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mei can skip at a rate of 2 miles per hour.

Since she can skip at a rate that is 1/2 as fast as she can run, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2.

So, her running speed is 2 * 2 = 4 miles per hour.

We are also given that she can run four times faster than she can walk. Let's call her walking speed ""x"" miles per hour. Then, her running speed is 4x miles per hour.

Since we already know her running speed is 4 miles per hour, we can set up the equation:

4x = 4

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

x = 1

So, her walking speed is 1 mile per hour.

Now, let's consider the time she spends on each activity. She spends 2/5 of the time running, 1/2 of the time skipping, and the remaining time walking.

The total time is 10 hours. We can find the time spent on each activity by multiplying the total time by the fraction of time spent on each activity.

Time spent running: 10 * 2/5 = 4 hours
Time spent skipping: 10 * 1/2 = 5 hours
Time spent walking: 10 - (4 + 5) = 1 hour

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled for each activity:

Distance traveled running: 4 hours * 4 miles/hour = 16 miles
Distance traveled skipping: 5 hours * 2 miles/hour = 10 miles
Distance traveled walking: 1 hour * 1 mile/hour = 1 mile

Since each serving",1000.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories you can still eat within your daily calorie target. 
You have a daily calorie target of 2300.

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total calories in the bag of cookies.
The bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 200 calories.
So, the total calories in the bag are 5 * 200 = 1000 calories.

Next, let's calculate the remaining daily calorie target.
Your daily calorie target is 2300, and you have already consumed 1200 calories.
You also exercised for 100 calories, which reduces your calorie intake.
So, the remaining daily calorie target is 2300 - 1200 - 100 = 1000 calories.

Since the bag of cookies has 1000 calories, and you want to stay within your daily calorie target of 1000 calories, you can eat the entire bag.

However, the question asks how many oz you can eat, not how many calories.

If he watched 24 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?",5.0,"## Step 1: Calculate the total hours watched on Saturday and Sunday
Noah watched 4-hour episodes each night on Saturday and Sunday, so he watched 2 * 4 = 8 hours of TV on the weekend.

## Step 2: Calculate the total hours watched on Tuesday
Noah watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show on Tuesday. First, convert the 45-minute show to hours: 45 minutes / 60 = 0.75 hours. Then, add the two shows together: 3 hours + 0.75 hours = 3.75 hours.

On Tuesday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. The total time he watched on Tuesday is 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.
On Wednesday, he watched two 5-hour episodes, so the total time he watched on Wednesday is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he watched four episodes, each 15 minutes. Let's call the total time he watched on Thursday ""y"". Since each episode is 15 minutes, the total time he watched on Thursday is 15y minutes.
We know that the total time he watched TV is 24 hours, so we can set up the equation:
8 + 15x + 3.75 + 10 + 15y = 24
Combine like terms:
8 + 3.75 + 10 + 15x + 15y = 24
21.75 + 15x + 15y = 24
Subtract 21.75 from both sides:
15x + 15y = 2.25

x + y = 0.15
We are asked to find the number of 15-minute episodes he watched on Monday, which is x. We can't find x directly, but we can find y by subtracting x from both sides:
y = 0.15 - x
We know that y is the total time he watched on Thursday, which is 15y minutes. Since each episode is 15 minutes, y is the number of episodes he watched on Thursday. We are not asked to find y, but we can find the total time he watched on Thursday, which is 15y minutes.

The answer is 15.",15.0,0,"Q: Noah watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Saturday and Sunday, he watched 4-hour episodes of his favorite show each night. On Monday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. On Tuesday, he finished homework early and watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. On Wednesday, he got to stay up late, so he watched two 5-hour episodes. On Thursday, he watched four episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 24 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total hours of TV watched on Saturday and Sunday:
4 hours/night * 2 nights = 8 hours

Next, let's calculate the total hours of TV watched on Wednesday:
2 episodes * 5 hours/episode = 10 hours

Now, let's calculate the total hours of TV watched on Thursday:
4 episodes * 15 minutes/episode = 60 minutes = 1 hour

We know that Noah watched a total of 24 hours of TV. Let's subtract the hours we've already accounted for:
24 hours - 8 hours - 10 hours - 1 hour = 5 hours

On Tuesday, Noah watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. Let's convert the 45-minute show to hours:
45 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 0.75 hours

So, the total hours of TV watched on Tuesday is:
3 hours + 0.75 hours = 3.75 hours

Now, let's subtract the hours we've already accounted for from the total hours:
5 hours - 3.75 hours = 1.25 hours

On Monday, Noah watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. Let's convert the total hours of TV watched on Monday to minutes:
1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Since each episode is 15 minutes, let's divide the total minutes by 15:
75 minutes / 15 minutes/episode = 5 episodes

If she used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.",504.0,"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of cups of water and tablespoons of milk used. 

Let's start by finding the total number of parts in the ratio of sugar and water, which is 63 + 14 = 77 parts.

Since the total amount of sugar used is 760 teaspoons, and the ratio of sugar to the total parts is 63:77, we can find the value of 1 part as follows:

1 part = 760 / 63
1 part = 760 / (63/77)
1 part = 760 * (77/63)
1 part = 960

Now, we can find the number of cups of water used:
Cups of water = 14 parts * 960
Cups of water = 13440 / 7
Cups of water = 1920

Next, we can find the number of tablespoons of milk used:
Tablespoons of milk = 9 * 1920 / 7
Tablespoons of milk = 9 * 274.29
Tablespoons of milk = 2468.61

However, since we can't have a fraction of a tablespoon, we can round down to 2469 tablespoons of milk.

Now, we can find the total number of parts used:
Total parts = 63 (sugar) + 1920 (water) + 2469 (milk)
Total parts = 3552

Since the total amount of sugar used is 760 teaspoons, and the ratio of sugar to the total parts is 63:3552, we can find the value of 1 part as follows:

1 part = 760 / 63
1 part = 760 / (63/3552)
1 part = 760 * (3552/63)
1 part = 38400

However, we can simplify this by using the fact that 1 part = 960 (from earlier). 

Now, we can find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used:
Teaspoonfuls of sugar = 63 parts * 960
Teaspoonfuls of sugar = 60480",60480.0,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Let's think step by step.
The ratio of sugar to water is 63:14.
This means that for every 63 teaspoons of sugar, Fatima uses 14 cups of water.
The ratio of water to milk is 7:9.
This means that for every 7 cups of water, Fatima uses 9 tablespoons of milk.
We are given that Fatima used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk.
Let's assume the number of cups of water used is 14x, where x is a multiplier.
Then, the number of tablespoons of milk used is (9/7) * 14x = 18x.
The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk used is 63x + 14x + 18x = 95x.
We are given that this total is equal to 760.
So, we can set up the equation 95x = 760.
To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 95:
x = 760 / 95
x = 8
Now that we know x, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar used:
Number of teaspoons of sugar = 63x
= 63 * 8

Favorable outcomes: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 = 11 numbers
Total outcomes: 20

Probability of rolling a number greater than 10 = 11 / 20 = 0.55 or 55%

To find the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row, we need to find the probability of rolling an odd number for each of the four rolls.

The probability of rolling an odd number on a 20-sided die is 10/20 = 0.5 (since half of the numbers 1-20 are odd).

Q: Luis is rolling a 20-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's consider the probability of rolling a number greater than 10.

There are 20 possible outcomes when rolling a 20-sided die.
The numbers greater than 10 are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
So, there are 10 favorable outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5.

Next, let's consider the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling an odd number on a 20-sided die is 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5.
Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16 = 0.0625.

He can write a page every 14 minutes. On average, how many hours does Yuki spend writing in a day?",4.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Yuki stopped being pen pals with 4 out of 8 people, so he is now pen pals with 8 - 4 = 4 people.

2. Each of these 4 people sends 3 letters a week, and each letter is 10 pages long. So, each person sends 3 x 10 = 30 pages per week.

3. Since there are 4 people, the total number of pages sent to Yuki per week is 4 x 30 = 120 pages.

4. Yuki responds in kind, so he also sends 120 pages per week.

5. Since Yuki can write 1 page every 14 minutes, the total time he spends writing per week is 120 pages x 14 minutes/page = 1680 minutes.

6. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 1680 minutes ÷ 60 = 28 hours.

7. Since we want to know how many hours Yuki spends writing in a day, we divide the total hours per week by 7 (the number of days in a week): 28 hours ÷ 7 = 4 hours per day.

Therefore, Yuki spends an average of 4 hours per day writing to his pen pals.",4.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Yuki was a pen pal with 8 people.
He stopped being pen pals with 4 of them.
So, he is still pen pals with 8 - 4 = 4 people.

Each of these 4 people sends 3 letters a week.
Since there are 52 weeks in a year, each person sends 3 * 52 = 156 letters a year.

Yuki responds to each of these letters, so he also sends 156 letters a year.

Each letter is 10 pages long, so Yuki sends 156 * 10 = 1560 pages a year.

Since Yuki can write a page every 14 minutes, he can write 60 / 14 = 4.29 pages per hour.

To find the total number of hours Yuki spends writing in a year, we divide the total number of pages he writes by the number of pages he can write per hour: 1560 / 4.29 = 363.8 hours.

However, the question asks for the average number of hours Yuki spends writing in a day. To find this, we divide the total number of hours he spends writing in a year by 365 (the number of days in a year): 363.8 / 365 = 1 hour.

The answer is 1.",1.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Yuki starts as a pen pal with 8 people.
He stops being pen pals with 4 of them.
So, he is left with 8 - 4 = 4 pen pals.

Each of his pen pals sends 3 letters a week, and each letter is 10 pages long.
So, the total number of pages he receives per week is 3 * 10 = 30 pages per pen pal.
Since he has 4 pen pals, the total number of pages he receives per week is 4 * 30 = 120 pages.

He responds in kind, so he also sends 120 pages per week.

He can write 1 page every 14 minutes.

To find the total number of minutes he spends writing per week, we multiply the total number of pages he writes by the time it takes to write one page: 120 pages * 14 minutes/page = 1680 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can convert the total number of minutes to hours: 1680 minutes / 60 = 28 hours.

1. The selling price of the property is $500,000.
2. Ms. Johnson gets a 10% discount on the selling price, so the discounted price is:
$500,000 - (10% of $500,000) = $500,000 - $50,000 = $450,000
3. The brokerage fee is 4% of the selling price (not the discounted price), so the brokerage fee is:
4% of $500,000 = 0.04 x $500,000 = $20,000

The brokerage fee is 4% of the selling price.

- Emma also wants to give each friend €4 in pinball tokens, so the total cost for pinball tokens will be x * 4.

The total cost for the activities is the sum of the costs for laser tag, roller coaster, and pinball tokens:
Total cost = (2 + x * 6) + (3 * x * 10) + (x * 4)

We also need to add the cost of renting the bus, which is €60.

The total budget is €180, so we can set up the equation:
(2 + x * 6) + (3 * x * 10) + (x * 4) + 60 = 180

Now, let's simplify the equation:
(2 + 6x) + (30x) + (4x) + 60 = 180
Combine like terms:
40x + 62 = 180

Subtract 62 from both sides:
40x = 118

Divide both sides by 40:
x = 118 / 40
x = 2.95

Since we can't invite a fraction of a friend, we'll round down to the nearest whole number:
x = 2

However, this is the number of friends Emma can invite, but we also need to include Emma herself. So, the total number of people (Emma and her friends) is x + 1:
Total number of people = 2 + 1 = 3

But this is not the answer we are looking for. We are looking for the number of friends Emma can invite. So, the correct answer is the number of friends, which is 2.

The answer is 2.",2.0,1

Q: There are 80 fourth-graders at Oak Ridge School. 34 of them are girls. On Thursday, 8 fourth-grade girls and 7 fourth-grade boys were absent. On Thursday, what percentage of the present fourth grade students were boys?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's find out how many students were absent on Thursday.
8 girls and 7 boys were absent.
So, the total number of absent students is 8 + 7 = 15.

Next, let's find out how many students were present on Thursday.
There are 80 fourth-graders in total.
15 students were absent.
So, the number of present students is 80 - 15 = 65.

Now, let's find out how many of the present students were boys.
There are 34 girls in total.
8 girls were absent.
So, the number of present girls is 34 - 8 = 26.
Since there are 65 present students in total, the number of present boys is 65 - 26 = 39.

To find the percentage of present boys, we need to divide the number of present boys by the total number of present students and multiply by 100.
So, the percentage of present boys is (39 / 65) * 100.

How much does he earn in a year after paying 25% in taxes?,1296.0,"To find the carpenter's yearly income, we need to calculate his daily income, then his monthly income, and finally his yearly income before taxes. After that, we can calculate the taxes and subtract them to find his yearly income after taxes.

1. Daily income:
The carpenter works 6 days a week and 2 weeks a month. 
So, his work days in a month = 6 days/week * 2 weeks/month = 12 days/month.

His daily income = ¥12

2. Monthly income:
Total days in a year = 12 months/year * 31 days/month (assuming an average month with 31 days) = 372 days/year
Total workdays in a year = 372 days/year * 6 days/week * 2 weeks/month / (12 days/month * 2 weeks/month) = 372 days/year (this will be used directly in calculation below)

However, to simplify the calculation, we can calculate the total monthly income directly. 
So, his monthly income = 12 days/month * ¥12/day = ¥144/month

3. Yearly income before taxes:
Total workdays in a year = 12 months/year * 12 days/month = 144 days/year
His yearly income before taxes = 144 days/year * ¥12/day = ¥1728/year

The carpenter works for 2 weeks every month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, he works for 2 * 4 = 8 weeks in a month.

Q: A carpenter works for 2 weeks every month and 6 days every week. He gets paid ¥12 every day. How much does he earn in a year after paying 25% in taxes?

The carpenter works for 2 weeks every month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, he works for 2 * 4 = 8 weeks every month.

He also works for 6 days every week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, he works for 6 * 4 = 24 days every month.

He gets paid ¥12 every day. So, his total earnings in a year is 576 * 12 = ¥6912.

However, he has to pay 25% in taxes. So, the amount of taxes he pays is 25% of ¥6912, which is 0.25 * 6912 = ¥1728.

Initially, Theo has 25 kiwis. Since there are eight times as many pineapples as kiwis, he has 8 × 25 = 200 pineapples.

After buying 63 more kiwis, he now has 25 + 63 = 88 kiwis.

He bought 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis, so he bought 88 - 19 = 69 pineapples. Now, he has 200 + 69 = 269 pineapples.

Later, he bought 13 pineapples, so he now has 269 + 13 = 282 pineapples.

He bought 22 fewer than two times as many kiwis, which means he bought 2 × 88 - 22 = 154 kiwis. Now, he has 88 + 154 = 242 kiwis.

Theo starts with 25 kiwis.
He buys 63 more kiwis.
So, the total number of kiwis is 25 + 63 = 88.

We are also given that there are 8 times as many pineapples as kiwis initially. 
So, the initial number of pineapples is 8 * 25 = 200.

Then, Theo buys 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis. 
The number of pineapples before the second purchase is 200. 
Theo buys 19 fewer pineapples, so he buys 200 - 19 = 181 pineapples.

To find the number of pineapples after the second purchase, we add the pineapples bought to the initial number: 200 + 181 = 381 pineapples.

A: Let's think step by step.

The carpenter works for 2 weeks every month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, he works for 2 * 4 = 8 weeks every month.

He also works for 6 days every week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, he works for 6 * 4 = 24 days every month.

In a year, there are 12 months. So, the total number of days he works in a year is 12 * 24 = 288 days.

He gets paid ¥12 every day. So, his total earnings in a year is 288 * 12 = ¥3456.

However, he has to pay 25% in taxes. So, the amount of taxes he pays is 25% of ¥3456, which is 0.25 * 3456 = ¥864.

1. Calculate the total amount of money Andre spent on crackers and pretzels.
2. Calculate the amount of money Andre had left after buying crackers and pretzels.
3. Calculate the amount of money Andre spent on gum.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Andre spent on crackers and pretzels.

Andre bought 4 bags of crackers at 75 cents each, so the total amount of money he spent on crackers is:
4 x 0.75 = 3 dollars

Andre bought 7 packs of pretzels at $7 each, so the total amount of money he spent on pretzels is:
7 x 7 = 49 dollars

The total amount of money Andre spent on crackers and pretzels is:
3 + 49 = 52 dollars

3% of $100 = 0.03 x $100 = $3

So, Andre had $3 left after buying crackers and pretzels.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Andre spent on gum.

We know that Andre spent $100 and had $3 left, so the amount of money he spent on gum is:
$100 - $3 = $97

We also know that Andre spent $52 on crackers and pretzels, so the amount of money he spent on gum is:
$97 - $52 = $45

If the length of his room is 16 feet longer that its width, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?",68.0,"To solve this problem, we need to first find the width and length of the room. Let's call the width ""w"" and the length ""l"". We know that the area of the room is 225 square feet, so we can write an equation:

w × l = 225

We also know that the length of the room is 16 feet longer than its width, so we can write another equation:

l = w + 16

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

w × (w + 16) = 225

Expanding the left-hand side of the equation, we get:

w^2 + 16w = 225

Rearranging the equation to form a quadratic equation, we get:

w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0

Now we can factor the quadratic equation:

(w + 25)(w - 9) = 0

This tells us that either (w + 25) = 0 or (w - 9) = 0.

Solving for w, we get:

w + 25 = 0 --> w = -25 (not possible, since width cannot be negative)
w - 9 = 0 --> w = 9

So the width of the room is 9 feet.

Now we can find the length of the room by substituting w = 9 into the equation l = w + 16:

l = 9 + 16
l = 25

So the length of the room is 25 feet.

Now that we have the width and length of the room, we can find the perimeter by using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 × (width + length)

Substituting w = 9 and l = 25, we get:

Perimeter = 2 × (9 + 25)
Perimeter = 2 × 34
Perimeter = 68

Therefore, the perimeter of Kai's office is 68 feet.",68.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

We know the area of Kai's office is 225 square feet.
The formula for the area of a rectangle is length * width.
Let's represent the width as 'w'. Since the length is 16 feet longer than the width, the length is 'w + 16'.
So, the area equation is w * (w + 16) = 225.

To find the width, we need to solve the quadratic equation w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0.
We can solve this equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Let's use factoring.

The equation w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0 can be factored as (w + 25)(w - 9) = 0.
Setting each factor equal to 0, we get w + 25 = 0 or w - 9 = 0.
Solving for w, we get w = -25 or w = 9.
Since the width cannot be negative, we discard w = -25.

So, the width is w = 9 feet.

Now that we have the width, we can find the length by adding 16 to the width: length = 9 + 16 = 25 feet.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula 2 * (length + width).
So, the perimeter is 2 * (9 + 25) = 2 * 34 = 68 feet.

Let's break down the information:

1. Pink cards: 30
2. Red cards: 70% more than pink cards
   To find 70% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.7: 30 * 0.7 = 21

To find the average number of cards per color, we divide the total number of cards of each color by the number of colors (3):

The number of red cards is 70% more than the number of pink cards. To find 70% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.7:
30 * 0.7 = 21

So, there are 21 more red cards than pink cards. To find the total number of red cards, we add 21 to the number of pink cards:
30 + 21 = 51

The number of purple cards is the sum of pink and red cards:
30 (pink) + 51 (red) = 81

To find the average number of cards per color, we divide the total number of cards by the number of colors:
There are 3 colors (pink, red, and purple).

In 4 years, Jasmine will be 4 times as old as James is now. Since James is 8 years old now, Jasmine will be 4 * 8 = 32 years old in 4 years.

In 6 years, James will be 12 + 6 = 18 years old.

In 6 years, Jasmine will be 32 + 6 = 38 years old.

To find the average of James and Jasmine in 6 years, we need to add their ages and divide by 2.

The sum of their ages is 18 + 38 = 56.

The average of their ages is 56 / 2 = 28.

However, this is not the average of their ages in 6 years, but rather the average of their ages at the time the problem states Jasmine will be 4 times as old as James is now. To find the average of their ages in 6 years, we need to calculate their ages in 6 years and then find the average.

Emma wants to make two warm jackets for herself, each needing 11 skeins of wool. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?",318.0,"To find out how many skeins of wool Emma needs to buy, we'll first calculate the total number of skeins needed for the quadruplets and then add the number of skeins needed for the two warm jackets.

For the quadruplets:
- Poncho: 18 skeins * 4 = 72 skeins
- Hat: 17 skeins * 4 = 68 skeins
- Beanie: 15 skeins * 4 = 60 skeins
- Booties: 8 skeins * 4 = 32 skeins
- Gloves: 16 skeins * 4 = 64 skeins

Total skeins for quadruplets: 72 + 68 + 60 + 32 + 64 = 296 skeins

For Emma's warm jackets:
- 2 jackets * 11 skeins/jacket = 22 skeins

How many letters has Kayla written in total?",572.0,"To find the total number of letters Kayla has written, let's break down her writing process step by step.

**Step 1: Writing the alphabet in full five times**
The alphabet has 26 letters. Writing it 5 times will result in 26 * 5 = 130 letters.

**Step 2: Writing three-sixths of the alphabet once**
Three-sixths of the alphabet means 3/6 or 1/2 of the alphabet. 1/2 of 26 letters is 26 * 1/2 = 13 letters.

**Total letters written so far:** 130 + 13 = 143 letters.

**Step 3: Writing everything she has already written**
In this step, she re-writes the alphabet 5 times (130 letters) and a half of the alphabet (13 letters). The total is 130 + 13 = 143 letters.

**Total letters written so far:** 143 + 143 = 286 letters.

**Step 4: Writing everything she has written so far (again)**
In this final step, she re-writes the alphabet 5 times (130 letters) and a half of the alphabet (13 letters) again. The total is 130 + 13 = 143 letters.

**Total letters written:** 286 + 143 = 429 letters.

Therefore, Kayla has written a total of 429 letters.",429.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Kayla starts by writing the alphabet in full five times.
So, she writes 26 letters each time, and she does this 5 times.

Then, she writes three-sixths of the alphabet once.
Three-sixths of 26 is (3/6) * 26 = 13.
So, she writes 13 letters this time.

Now, she re-writes everything she has already written.
She has written 130 + 13 = 143 letters so far.
So, she re-writes 143 letters.

After some rest, she re-writes everything she has written so far.
She has written 143 + 143 = 286 letters so far.

When the water is warm, Carlos swims a kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times as long. How much longer does Carlos take to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day than 9 kilometers on a cold day?",272.0,"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Carlos to swim 1 kilometer on a warm day, and then how long it takes him to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day and 9 kilometers on a cold day.

**Step 1: Find out how long it takes Carlos to swim 1 kilometer on a warm day**

When the water is warm, Carlos swims a kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times as long as it takes him to swim a kilometer on a cold day. Since it takes him 11 minutes to swim a kilometer on a cold day, four times that is 4 x 11 = 44 minutes. 9 minutes more than that is 44 + 9 = 53 minutes.

**Step 2: Find out how long it takes Carlos to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day**

Since it takes Carlos 53 minutes to swim 1 kilometer on a warm day, it will take him 7 x 53 = 371 minutes to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day.

**Step 3: Find out how long it takes Carlos to swim 9 kilometers on a cold day**

Since it takes Carlos 11 minutes to swim 1 kilometer on a cold day, it will take him 9 x 11 = 99 minutes to swim 9 kilometers on a cold day.

**Step 4: Find out how much longer it takes Carlos to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day than 9 kilometers on a cold day**

To find out how much longer it takes Carlos to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day than 9 kilometers on a cold day, we need to subtract the time it takes him to swim 9 kilometers on a cold day from the time it takes him to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day. That is 371 - 99 = 272 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{272}$",272.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Carlos swims a kilometer in 11 minutes when the water is cold.

When the water is warm, he swims a kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times as long as it takes in cold water. Four times as long is 11 * 4 = 44. 
So, in warm water, he swims a kilometer in 44 + 9 = 53 minutes.

To find out how long it takes him to swim 7 kilometers in warm water, we multiply the time for one kilometer by 7: 53 * 7 = 371 minutes.

To find out how long it takes him to swim 9 kilometers in cold water, we multiply the time for one kilometer by 9: 11 * 9 = 99 minutes.

To find out how much longer Carlos takes to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day than 9 kilometers on a cold day, we need to find the difference between the time taken for 9 kilometers in cold water and 7 kilometers in warm water. But since this is a subtraction of larger number from smaller we'll calculate the time it takes for 7 kilometers in cold water and 9 kilometers in warm water. 
The time it takes for 7 kilometers in cold water is 11 * 7 = 77 minutes. 
The time it takes for 9 kilometers in warm water is 53 * 9 = 477 minutes.

The difference between the time for 9 kilometers in warm water and 7 kilometers in cold water is 477 - 77 = 400.

The answer is 400.",400.0,0,"I'll solve the given problem step by step.

To find how much longer Carlos takes to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day than 9 kilometers on a cold day, we first need to calculate the time it takes for Carlos to swim 9 kilometers on a cold day and 7 kilometers on a warm day.

Q: How long does it take Carlos to swim 9 kilometers on a cold day?
A: Let's think step by step.
Carlos swims a kilometer in 11 minutes on a cold day.
So, to swim 9 kilometers, he will take 9 * 11 = 99 minutes.
The answer is 99.

Q: How long does it take Carlos to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day?
A: Let's think step by step.
When the water is warm, Carlos swims a kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times as long as on a cold day.
On a cold day, he swims a kilometer in 11 minutes.
So, on a warm day, he swims a kilometer in 11 + 9 = 20 minutes.
To swim 7 kilometers, he will take 7 * 20 = 140 minutes.
The answer is 140.

Q: Now, let's compare the times for 9 kilometers on a cold day and 7 kilometers on a warm day.
A: Let's think step by step.
Carlos swims 9 kilometers in 99 minutes on a cold day.
He swims 7 kilometers in 140 minutes on a warm day.

What is the total weekly production for the three if they work all days of the week?",840.0,"To find the total weekly production for the three, we need to find the daily production for each and then multiply by 7.

Let's start by finding the daily production for Emma, Nadia, and Uma.

Emma processes 8 customers per day.

Since Nadia operates the cash register exactly nine times as fast as Emma, Nadia's daily production is 9 times Emma's daily production:
Nadia's daily production = 9 × 8 = 72 customers

Uma operates at the same speed as the average of Emma and Nadia. To find Uma's daily production, we need to find the average of Emma's and Nadia's daily production:
Average of Emma and Nadia = (8 + 72) / 2 = 40 customers
Uma's daily production = 40 customers

Now that we have the daily production for each, we can find the total weekly production by multiplying each daily production by 7:
Emma's weekly production = 8 × 7 = 56 customers
Nadia's weekly production = 72 × 7 = 504 customers
Uma's weekly production = 40 × 7 = 280 customers

The total weekly production for the three is the sum of their individual weekly production:
Total weekly production = 56 + 504 + 280 = 840 customers

Therefore, the total weekly production for the three is 840 customers.",840.0,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Nadia operates the cash register exactly nine times as fast as Emma, which means Nadia's speed is 9 times Emma's speed. If Emma processes 8 customers per day, Nadia processes 9 * 8 = 72 customers per day.

Uma operates at the same speed as the average of Emma and Nadia. To find Uma's speed, we need to find the average of Emma's and Nadia's speeds. The average is (8 + 72) / 2 = 40 customers per day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of customers processed by each person in a week (7 days).

Emma processes 8 customers per day, so in a week, she processes 8 * 7 = 56 customers.
Nadia processes 72 customers per day, so in a week, she processes 72 * 7 = 504 customers.
Uma processes 40 customers per day, so in a week, she processes 40 * 7 = 280 customers.

He also decided to buy himself a bagel for ₣4. Since he shopped more than ₣50, he received a ₣23 discount. How much does Santiago have to pay?",275.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, let's find out how much flour Santiago buys in a week. He uses 3 kilograms per day and buys for a week, so:
   3 kg/day * 7 days/week = 21 kg/week

2. The normal brand of flour costs ₣10 per kilogram. The more expensive brand costs 40% more than the normal brand. 40% of ₣10 is:
   (40/100) * ₣10 = ₣4
   So the more expensive brand costs ₣10 + ₣4 = ₣14 per kilogram.

7. The final amount Santiago has to pay is:
   ₣298 - ₣23 = ₣275

So, Santiago has to pay ₣275.",275.0,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Santiago needs to buy a week's worth of flour, which is 7 days. He uses 3 kilograms of flour per day, so he needs a total of 7 * 3 = 21 kilograms of flour.

The normal brand of flour costs ₣10 per kilogram, but the more expensive brand costs 40% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate 40% of ₣10 and add it to ₣10.

40% of ₣10 is 0.4 * ₣10 = ₣4. So, the more expensive brand costs ₣10 + ₣4 = ₣14 per kilogram.

The total cost of the flour is 21 kilograms * ₣14 per kilogram = ₣294.

Santiago also wants to buy a bagel for ₣4.

The total cost before the discount is ₣294 + ₣4 = ₣298.

Since Santiago shopped more than ₣50, he received a ₣23 discount. To find the final cost, we need to subtract the discount from the total cost.

Water used per giant cube = 12 grams
Total water used for giant cubes = 8 x 12 = 96 grams

Number of medium cubes = 15
Water used per medium cube = 11 grams

1. First, let's add up the number of students who like to bake and hurling. 
   Students who like to bake or hurling = 34 (baking) + 6 (hurling) = 40.

2. Since there are 160 students in total, and 40 like to bake or hurling, the number of students who like to either paint or read is 160 - 40 = 120.

3. Let's denote the number of students who like to play hurling as 'x'. Then, the number of students who like to read is 4x - 3.

4. We know that the total number of students who like to either paint or read is 120. If we include the number of students who like to hurl (x) and read (4x - 3), we get the equation: 
   x + (4x - 3) = 120

5. Now, we can solve the equation to find the value of x.
   x + 4x - 3 = 120
   5x - 3 = 120
   5x = 120 + 3
   5x = 123
   x = 123/5
   x = 24.6

6. Since we can't have a fraction of a student, and 'x' represents the number of students, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, since you're looking for the number of students that like to paint, we'll continue with the assumption that 'x' is 24.6, which we'll use for the calculation. But for clarity let's use 24 as 'x' is the number that like hurling and we use this in the equation for the number of students who like to read which is 4x - 3. 
   Number of students who like to read = 4(24) - 3 = 96 - 3 = 93.

7. Since we know the total number of students who like to paint or read is 120, and we've calculated that 93 like to read, the number of students who like to paint is:
   Number of students who like to paint = 120 - 93 = 27.

Yuki's friends will cover half of the cost, which is ¥490 / 2 = ¥245.

So, the total amount of money that will be covered by the youth club and Yuki's friends is ¥49 + ¥245 = ¥294.

Yuki is raising money for a music festival that costs ¥490. 

The youth club is covering a tenth of the cost. So, the portion covered by the youth club is 1/10 of ¥490. 
1/10 * 490 = 49

Yuki's friends are covering half of the cost. So, the portion covered by his friends is 1/2 of ¥490.
1/2 * 490 = 245

We know Yuki already has ¥15. 
So, the portion covered by the youth club and his friends is 49 + 245 = 294.

The total cost of the music festival is ¥490. 
The amount covered by the youth club and his friends is ¥294. 
To find the amount Yuki is missing, we subtract the covered amount from the total cost.

Two-fourths of Yusuf's score is (2/4) * 260 = 130.
Oscar scored 8 points more than that, so Oscar scored 130 + 8 = 138 points.

1. Noah has 7 ¥50 bills, so he has a total of:

2. He buys 2 puzzles for ¥4 each. So the total cost of the puzzles is:
   2 x 4 = 8 ¥

3. He gets a 25% discount on the puzzles. To find the discount amount, we need to calculate 25% of 8 ¥:
   25% of 8 = (25/100) x 8 = 2 ¥
   Discounted price of puzzles = 8 - 2 = 6 ¥

4. He buys 4 packs of pencils for ¥5 each. So the total cost of the pencils is:

Due to the flu season, 35 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.",50.0,"To find the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of occupied and out-of-service beds and then subtract that from the total capacity.

1. Calculate the number of beds occupied (1/8 of 800):
   800 * 1/8 = 800 / 8 = 100 beds

2. Calculate the number of beds that are out of service (1/5 of 800):
   800 * 1/5 = 800 / 5 = 160 beds

3. Calculate the total number of occupied and out-of-service beds:
   100 (occupied) + 160 (out-of-service) = 260 beds

4. Since the hospital is admitting 35 patients per day, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks (14 days):
   35 patients/day * 14 days = 490 patients

5. Add the admitted patients to the occupied and out-of-service beds:
   260 (occupied and out-of-service) + 490 (admitted) = 750 beds

6. Subtract the occupied and out-of-service beds (including admitted patients) from the total capacity:
   800 (total capacity) - 750 (occupied and out-of-service) = 50 beds

However, we need to account for the original out-of-service beds (160) that didn't get included in our previous calculations as the admitted patients took their place. We need to subtract the number of admitted patients from the original out-of-service beds to find the remaining out-of-service beds:
   160 (out-of-service) - 35 (admitted in a day) * 14 (days) / 2 (since they are replacing out-of-service beds) = 160 - 245 = -85 
However, since we can't have negative number of out-of-service beds, we'll use the maximum number of out of service beds = 0 

7. Calculate the number of out-of-service beds after 2 weeks:
   Since we don't need to consider the 160 out-of-service beds in our calculations since they got replaced by admitted patients, 
   the number of out-of-service beds remains 0.

8. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds:
   800 (total capacity) - (750 (occupied) + 0 (out-of-service)) = 800 - 750 = 50 beds",50.0,1,"A: Let's think step by step.
The hospital has a capacity of 800 beds.
1/8 of the beds are occupied, which is 800 / 8 = 100 beds.
One-fifth of the beds are out of service, which is 800 / 5 = 160 beds.
So, the total number of occupied and out of service beds is 100 + 160 = 260 beds.
The hospital has 800 beds in total.
So, the number of unoccupied beds is 800 - 260 = 540 beds.
The hospital admits 35 patients each day.
There are 14 days in 2 weeks.
So, the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is 35 * 14 = 490 patients.
The hospital had 260 occupied beds initially.
After admitting 490 patients, the total number of occupied beds is 260 + 490 = 750 beds.
So, the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is 800 - 750 = 50 beds.

**Monday:**

* Cupcakes: 24 boxes
* Orange pies: 16 fewer boxes than Tuesday, so 28 - 16 = 12 boxes

**Tuesday:**

* Cupcakes: 11 more boxes than Monday, so 24 + 11 = 35 boxes
* Orange pies: 28 boxes

**Wednesday:**

* Total sales for Monday and Tuesday: Cupcakes (24 + 35) + Orange pies (12 + 28) = 59 + 40 = 99 boxes
* Since Andre sold as much as he did in the past two days combined, he sold 99 boxes on Wednesday.

**Total sales for the three days:**

Andre's sales for Monday and Tuesday:
- On Monday, he sold 24 boxes of cupcakes and an unknown number of boxes of orange pie, which is 16 fewer than the number he sold on Tuesday. 
- Let's assume the number of boxes sold on Tuesday is C for cupcakes and P for orange pies. 
- So for Monday, the number of boxes sold is C - 16 for oranges.
- On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday, which is C + 11.
- The number of boxes sold on Tuesday was 28, so C + 11 = 28. 
- Therefore, C = 28 - 11 = 17.
- On Monday, he sold 17 - 16 = 1 box of orange pie.

Andre's sales for Monday and Tuesday:
- For Monday, he sold 24 boxes of cupcakes and 1 box of orange pie.
- For Tuesday, he sold 28 boxes of cupcakes and 28 boxes of orange pie.

Total sales for Monday and Tuesday:
- Cupcakes: 24 + 28 = 52 boxes.
- Orange pies: 1 + 28 = 29 boxes.

Andre's sales for Wednesday:
- On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined, which is 52 + 29 = 81 boxes in total.
- The number of boxes of cupcakes sold on Wednesday is 52 + 11 = 63.
- The number of boxes of orange pies sold on Wednesday is 29.

Total earnings for the three days:

Q: Andre is selling cupcakes and orange pies for a fundraiser. On Monday, he sold 24 boxes of cupcake and 16 fewer boxes of orange pie, than on Tuesday. On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday and 28 boxes of orange pie. On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the cupcake cost ₺10 and the orange pie cost ₺22, how much was Andre's average daily earning?

A: Let's think step by step.

On Monday, Andre sold 24 boxes of cupcakes and 16 fewer boxes of orange pie than on Tuesday. Since he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes on Tuesday, he must have sold 24 - 11 = 13 boxes of cupcakes on Monday. Therefore, on Monday, he sold 13 boxes of cupcakes and 13 - 16 = -3 boxes of orange pie (he actually sold 0 boxes of orange pie on Monday).

On Tuesday, Andre sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday, which is 24 + 11 = 35 boxes of cupcakes. He also sold 28 boxes of orange pie.

On Wednesday, Andre sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. The total number of boxes of cupcakes sold on Monday and Tuesday is 24 + 35 = 59. The total number of boxes of orange pie sold on Monday and Tuesday is 0 + 28 = 28. Therefore, on Wednesday, Andre sold 59 boxes of cupcakes and 28 boxes of orange pie.

The total earnings from selling cupcakes on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday is 24 * 10 + 35 * 10 + 59 * 10 = 240 + 350 + 590 = 1180. The total earnings from selling orange pies on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday is 0 * 22 + 28 * 22 + 28 * 22 = 0 + 616 + 616 = 1232.

The total earnings over the three days is 1180 + 1232 = 2412. The average daily earning is 2412 / 3 = 804.

Out of the remaining class, 40% of the students are robotics club members or part of choir members. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away competition. Half of the volleyball players are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the competition?",62.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Find the number of volleyball players**

24% of 125 students are volleyball players. To find the number of volleyball players, multiply 125 by 0.24:

125 x 0.24 = 30

So, there are 30 volleyball players in the class.

**Step 2: Find the number of remaining students**

Since 30 students are volleyball players, subtract 30 from the total number of students to find the remaining students:

125 - 30 = 95

**Step 3: Find the number of robotics club members or choir members**

40% of the remaining 95 students are robotics club members or choir members. To find the number of these students, multiply 95 by 0.40:

95 x 0.40 = 38

So, there are 38 robotics club members or choir members.

**Step 4: Find the number of students leaving early (excluding volleyball players)**

Since half of the volleyball players are absent for being sick, we need to find the number of volleyball players who are not absent. Half of 30 is 15, so 15 volleyball players are not absent.

Now, add the number of volleyball players who are not absent (15) to the number of robotics club members or choir members (38) to find the total number of students leaving early (excluding volleyball players):

15 + 38 = 53

**Step 5: Add the number of cheerleaders**

Since 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups, we need to add 3 times the number of groups. There are 3 groups (volleyball players, robotics club members, and choir members), so multiply 3 by 3:

3 x 3 = 9

Add the number of cheerleaders (9) to the total number of students leaving early (excluding volleyball players):

53 + 9 = 62

**Step 6: Add the number of volleyball players who are not absent**

Finally, add the number of volleyball players who are not absent (15) to the total number of students leaving early:

62 + 15 = 77

Therefore, 77 students are leaving early to the competition.",77.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the number of volleyball players in Dr. Lee's class.
The total number of students is 125.
24% of the class are volleyball players.
So, the number of volleyball players is 125 * 0.24 = 30.

Next, we need to find the number of students remaining in the class after removing the volleyball players.
The number of students remaining is 125 - 30 = 95.

Now, let's calculate the number of students who are robotics club members or part of the choir.
40% of the remaining students are in these groups.
So, the number of students in these groups is 95 * 0.40 = 38.

Now, we have two groups of students leaving early: volleyball players and the robotics club or choir students.
The number of volleyball players leaving is half of 30, which is 30 / 2 = 15.
The number of students in the robotics club or choir leaving is 38.

Now, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each group, so we need to add 3 times the number of groups to the total number of students leaving.
There are 3 groups (volleyball, robotics club, and choir), so the number of cheerleaders is 3 * 3 = 9.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of the volleyball players, the robotics club members, the choir members, and the cheerleaders.
So, the total number of students leaving early is 15 + 38 + 9 = 62.

However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a €5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Mei spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",22.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total space needed for the plants and the space between them**

Mei's flower bed is 143 feet long. Each plant takes up 3 feet (width) + 13 feet (space between plants) = 16 feet of space. 

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of plants Mei can fit in her flower bed**

To find the total number of plants, we'll divide the length of the flower bed by the space needed for each plant:

143 feet (flower bed) ÷ 16 feet (space per plant) = 8.9375

Since Mei can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 8 plants (she already owns 8, so she needs to buy 0 more plants to fill the bed).

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of plants Mei needs to buy**

Mei already owns 8 plants, but we calculated that she needs 8 plants to fill the bed. Since she already has 8 plants, she doesn't need to buy any more.

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the plants**

Mei doesn't need to buy any plants, so the total cost will be €0.

However, let's assume Mei wants to buy more plants to fill the bed. If she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a €5 discount on the entire purchase.

**Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the plants if Mei buys more than 2 plants**

If Mei buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a €5 discount. Let's assume she buys 8 plants (the number she needs to fill the bed).

The cost of 8 plants at €9 each is: 8 x €9 = €72

With the €5 discount, the total cost will be: €72 - €5 = €67

Mei has a flower bed that is 143 feet long. She wants to fill it with plants that grow 3 feet wide, and she needs to leave 13 feet between every plant (including the plant's width).

Step 1: Calculate the total space Mei needs to fill with plants.
The flower bed is 143 feet long, and Mei needs to leave 13 feet between every plant. Since each plant is 3 feet wide, the total space needed for each plant is 3 + 13 = 16 feet.

Step 2: Calculate the number of plants Mei can fit in the flower bed.
To find the number of plants, we need to divide the total length of the flower bed (143 feet) by the total space needed for each plant (16 feet).

However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a €5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Mei spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many plants Mei can fit in her flower bed. To do this, we need to find the total space available for plants, which is the length of the flower bed minus the space between plants.

The space between plants is 13 feet, and each plant is 3 feet wide, so the total space between plants is 13 + 3 = 16 feet.

Now, we can divide the length of the flower bed by the total space between plants to find out how many plants Mei can fit:

143 feet (flower bed) / 16 feet (space between plants) = 8.9375 plants

Since Mei can't fit a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 8 plants (she already owns 8, so she needs to buy 0 more).

However, this is not the correct answer. Let's continue.

Mei needs to buy 0 more plants, but she can still get a discount if she buys more than 2 plants. Since she's buying 0 plants, she won't get a discount.

The total cost of the plants Mei needs to buy is 0 * €9 = €0.

However, this is not the correct answer. Let's continue.

Mei needs to buy 0 plants, but she still needs to consider the cost of the plants she already owns. Since she owns 8 plants, the total cost is 8 * €9 = €72.

However, this is not the correct answer. Let's continue.

Mei needs to buy 0 plants, but she still needs to consider the discount she would have gotten if she bought more than 2 plants. Since she's buying 0 plants, she won't get a discount.

However, we can still calculate the total cost of the plants she would have bought if she bought 2 more plants (in addition to the 8 she already owns). In this case, she would have bought a total of 10 plants, and the total cost would be 10 * €9 = €90. Since she would have gotten a €5 discount, the total cost would be €90 - €5 = €85.

However, this is not the correct answer. Let's continue.

Mei needs to buy 0 plants, but she still needs to consider the cost of the plants she already owns. Since she owns 8 plants, the total cost is 8 * €9 = €72.

However, we can still calculate the total cost of the plants she would have bought if she bought more than 2 plants. In this case, she would have gotten a discount, and the total cost would be less than €72.

Let's try to find the correct answer.

Mei needs to buy 0 plants, but she still needs to consider the cost of the plants she already owns. Since she owns 8 plants, the total cost is 8 * €9 = €72.

However, we can still calculate the total cost of the plants she would have bought if she bought more plants. Let's try to find the number of plants she would have bought if she got the maximum discount.

**Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to peel 60 clams**

Yara can peel 6 clams per minute. To find the time it takes to peel 60 clams, we can divide 60 by 6:

60 clams / 6 clams/minute = 10 minutes

**Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to saute 60 clams**

Yara can saute 20 clams in 8 minutes. To find the time it takes to saute 60 clams, we can divide 60 by 20 and then multiply by 8:

60 clams / 20 clams = 3
3 x 8 minutes = 24 minutes

However, this is not the total time it takes to saute 60 clams. We need to consider that Yara can't work in parallel, so we need to add the time it takes to peel the clams to the time it takes to saute the clams.

**Step 3: Calculate the total time it takes to peel and saute 60 clams**

We already calculated the time it takes to peel 60 clams (10 minutes) and the time it takes to saute 60 clams (24 minutes). However, we need to add the time it takes to wash the clams (19 minutes) to the total time.

Total time = Time to peel + Time to saute + Time to wash
= 10 minutes + 24 minutes + 19 minutes
= 53 minutes

Therefore, it will take Yara 53 minutes to peel and saute 60 clams if it takes 19 minutes to wash all the clams.",19.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to determine how long it takes Yara to peel and sauté 60 clams without washing time.

She can peel 6 clams per minute, so to peel 60 clams it will take her 60 / 6 = 10 minutes.

She can sauté 20 clams in 8 minutes, so to sauté 60 clams it will take her (60 / 20) * 8 = 24 minutes.

However, since Yara can't work in parallel, she will spend 10 minutes peeling and then 24 minutes sautéing, for a total time of 10 + 24 = 34 minutes.

It already takes 19 minutes to wash the clams, so the total time for the entire process is 19 + 34 = 53 minutes.

Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet. How much older is Liam's uncle than Liam?,22.0,"To find out how much older Liam's uncle is than Liam, we first need to determine the age difference between Liam and his uncle when Liam saw the comet for the second time.

Liam's uncle was 31 years old when he saw the comet. Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet. 

So, Liam was 31 * 2 = 62 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Since Comet Halley orbits the Sun every 53 years, we can calculate the number of years that have passed since Liam's uncle saw the comet. 

Liam's uncle saw the comet when he was 31 years old. 31 years have passed, so the comet will orbit the Sun 31 // 53 = 0 with a remainder of 26 times.

This means 26 years have passed since Liam's uncle saw the comet.

Now, we need to calculate Liam's age when the comet orbited the Sun again. Liam was 62 years old when he saw the comet for the second time. 26 years have passed, so we add 26 to Liam's age: 62 + 26 = 88.

Liam's age when the comet orbited the Sun again is 88 years.

Now, we need to calculate the age difference between Liam and his uncle.

Liam's uncle is 31 + 53 = 84 years old (he was 31 when he saw the comet for the first time and 53 years have passed).

The age difference between Liam and his uncle is 84 - 88 = -4 years.

However, this cannot be the case, as Liam's uncle is older than Liam. The error in the calculation arises from the fact that we are trying to calculate the age difference after the comet has orbited the Sun. We know that Liam was 62 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, which is 31 years after his uncle saw the comet. Therefore, Liam's age is actually 62 + 53 = 115 after the comet has orbited the Sun.

The age difference between Liam and his uncle is 115 - 84 = 31 years.",31.0,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Liam's uncle saw the comet when he was 31 years old.

To find out how much older Liam's uncle is than Liam, we need to find the age difference between them.

3. With a diamond pickaxe, one miner can mine 80% more than with a bronze pickaxe. 
   80% of 10 pounds is 0.8 * 10 = 8 pounds.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of emails that don't require any response**

16% of 150 emails don't require any response. To find 16% of 150, we multiply 150 by 0.16:

150 x 0.16 = 24

So, 24 emails don't require any response.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of emails that require a response**

Since 24 emails don't require any response, we subtract 24 from the total number of emails (150) to find the number of emails that require a response:

150 - 24 = 126

Let's say Ananya gets x yards of fence.

Since Tara gets 190 yards more than Ananya, Tara gets x + 190 yards.

Since Umar gets 30 yards more than Tara, Umar gets (x + 190) + 30 = x + 220 yards.

We know that the total amount of fence is 860 yards, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 190) + (x + 220) = 860

He then spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?",33.0,"To find out how many hours Santiago spends learning, we need to calculate the total hours he spends learning in a day and then multiply it by 5 (4 regular days plus 1 weekend day).

First, let's find out how many extra classes he has and how long they last with review time.

- Extra classes: 3 classes
- Time per class: 30 minutes
- Review time per class: 15 minutes
- Total time per class: 30 + 15 = 45 minutes
- Total time for 3 extra classes: 3 x 45 = 135 minutes

Since there are 6 periods in a normal student's day, but Santiago has 3 extra classes, he has a total of 9 periods in a day.

- Normal class time: 6 x 40 minutes = 240 minutes
- Extra class time: 135 minutes
- Total class time per day: 240 + 135 = 375 minutes
- Review time per day: 15 minutes (before each of the 3 extra classes) = 3 x 15 = 45 minutes
- Total review time per day: 45 minutes
- Total time per day: 375 + 45 = 420 minutes

Since Santiago goes to class for 4 days a week, we need to multiply the total time per day by 4.

- Total time per week (4 days): 420 x 4 = 1680 minutes

Santiago spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.

- Total minutes in a week: 7 days x 24 hours x 60 minutes = 1680 x 24 = 40320 minutes
- Extra time per week: 1/9 of 40320 = 40320 / 9 = 4480 minutes

Total minutes spent learning per week: 1680 + 4480 = 6160 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide the total minutes by 60.

So, Santiago spends approximately 102.67 hours a week learning.",102.67,0,"Let's think step by step.

There are 6 periods in a day, but Santiago has to take 3 extra classes. 
So, the total number of classes is 6 + 3 = 9 classes per day.

Each class is 30 minutes long, and he spends 15 minutes before each class. 
The total time for classes and review is 30 + 15 = 45 minutes per class.

Since he has 9 classes per day, the total time spent in class and review is 9 * 45 = 405 minutes per day.

He goes to class for 4 days a week. 
So, the total time spent in class and review is 405 * 4 = 1620 minutes per week.

On Saturday and Sunday, he spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes as extra learning time. 
One week has 7 days. 
So, one-ninth of 7 is 7 / 9 = 0.7777777777777778 or approximately 0.78 days.
Since the problem does not state that the extra time is the whole week and just one ninth of it, I am assuming the extra time is 0.78 * 1620 minutes or 1260 minutes.
However, the extra time can also be simply 1/9 * 7 * 405 minutes or 315 minutes. The question does not state that the extra time is for 2 days so to stay accurate, it should be 315 minutes.

Now, let's combine the time spent in class and review with the extra time. 
The total time spent learning is 1620 + 315 = 1935 minutes per week.

To find the total time in hours, we divide the total minutes by 60.

He then spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?

A: Let's think step by step.

Santiago takes 3 extra classes, each 30 minutes long, so the total time spent in class is 3 * 30 = 90 minutes.
However, he also spends 15 minutes before each class, so the total time spent reviewing and preparing is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.
The total time spent in class and reviewing/preparing is 90 + 45 = 135 minutes.
Since he goes to class for 4 days a week, the total time spent in class and reviewing/preparing per week is 135 * 4 = 540 minutes.
He then spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. Since there are 2 days in the weekend, he spends 2 * (1/9) * 540 = 120 minutes on the weekend.
The total time spent learning per week is 540 + 120 = 660 minutes.

On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?",75.0,"Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Since Olivia walks 20 kilometers every day, with 10 kilometers on the beach and 10 kilometers on the sidewalk, we can confirm that the problem is correct.

2. Initially, let's assume Olivia's speed on the beach is 'x' kilometers per hour. 

3. Since Olivia walks at four times the rate on the sidewalk compared to the beach, her speed on the sidewalk would be '4x' kilometers per hour.

4. However, due to the injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half on both the beach and the sidewalk. So, her speed on the beach becomes 'x/2' kilometers per hour, and on the sidewalk, it becomes '4x/2' or '2x' kilometers per hour.

5. We know that Olivia spends 60 minutes on the beach. To find out how long it takes her to walk 10 kilometers on the beach, we first need to find out her speed in kilometers per minute. 

To convert her speed to kilometers per minute, we need to convert her speed to kilometers per hour to minutes per hour as there are 60 minutes in an hour. Thus, her speed on the beach is x/2 km/h.

Now, let's find out how many kilometers she can walk in 60 minutes. The formula to find the distance is distance = speed * time = (x/2 km/h) * (60/60 h) since we have time in minutes and speed in km/h.
We multiply 60 minutes by 60/60 to get 1 hour which cancels the hour in the denominator. So, the formula distance = speed * time becomes (x/2) * 1 = x/2.

Since this distance is equal to 10 kilometers, x/2 = 10.

To find the value of x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2, x = 20 km/h.

Now that we have the speed on the beach, we can find the time it takes to walk on the beach: time = distance / speed. So time for the beach = 10 km / (x/2) = 10 * 2 / x = 20 / x. 

Since we know that x is 20, the time for the beach = 20 / 20 = 1 hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 1 hour is 60 minutes.

6. Now that we know it takes Olivia 60 minutes to walk 10 kilometers on the beach, we can find the time it takes for her to walk 10 kilometers on the sidewalk.

Since her speed on the sidewalk is 2x, and we know x is 20, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 20 = 40 kilometers per hour.

The time it takes to walk 10 kilometers on the sidewalk is distance / speed = 10 km / 40 km/h = 0.25 hours. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 0.25 hours is 0.25 * 60 = 15 minutes.

7. To find the total time it takes for Olivia to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, we add the time it takes her to walk on the beach and the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk. 

Total time = time on the beach + time on the sidewalk = 60 minutes + 15 minutes.

Olivia walks 20 kilometers every day, which includes 10 kilometers on the beach and 10 kilometers on the sidewalk.

Initially, let's assume Olivia's speed on the beach is x kilometers per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 4x kilometers per minute, since she walks at four times the rate on the sidewalk.

However, due to the injury, her speed has decreased by half on both the beach and the sidewalk. So, her new speed on the beach is x/2 kilometers per minute, and her new speed on the sidewalk is 2x kilometers per minute.

We are given that 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. We can use this information to find her speed on the beach.

Time = Distance / Speed
60 minutes = 10 km / (x/2)
60 = 20/x
x = 20/60
x = 1/3 km/min

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk.
Speed on sidewalk = 4x = 4(1/3) = 4/3 km/min

Now, let's find the time taken to walk on the sidewalk.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 10 km / (4/3 km/min)
Time = 10 * (3/4) = 7.5 minutes

The total time taken to walk the entire 20 kilometers is the sum of the time taken on the beach and the sidewalk.
Total time = 60 minutes (on the beach) + 7.5 minutes (on the sidewalk)
Total time = 67.5 minutes

Olivia walks 20 kilometers every day. This includes 10 kilometers on the beach and 10 kilometers on the sidewalk.

The time Olivia walks on the beach is 60 minutes. 

Initially, Olivia walks at a certain speed on the beach. However, due to an injury, her speed has decreased by half. If we assume her original speed on the beach was 's' kilometers per minute, then her current speed on the beach is s/2 kilometers per minute.

Since distance = speed * time, we can write the equation for the time it takes her to walk on the beach as 10 / (s/2) = 60.

Solving for 's', we get s = 20 km/min. 

Now, let's calculate her original speed on the sidewalk. It is given that she walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. So, her original speed on the sidewalk is 4s = 4 * 20 = 80 km/min.

Again, due to the injury, her speed has decreased by half. So, her current speed on the sidewalk is 80 / 2 = 40 km/min.

The time it takes for her to walk on the sidewalk is 10 / 40 = 0.25 hours which is equal to 15 minutes.

So, the total time for the entire walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 60 + 15 = 75 minutes.

Since there are 7 days in a week, 10 weeks contain 10 * 7 = 70 days.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pancakes Arjun eats in the first 57 days. 
He eats 3 pancakes a day for 57 days. So, the total number of pancakes is 3 * 57 = 171.

Step 3: Calculate the number of days left after the first 57 days. 
70 days - 57 days = 13 days.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of pancakes Arjun eats in the remaining 13 days. 
He eats 9 pancakes a day for 13 days. So, the total number of pancakes is 9 * 13 = 117.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of pancakes Arjun eats in 10 weeks. 
The total number of pancakes is 171 + 117 = 288.

Esteban hid 11 dozen eggs, which is 11 * 12 = 132 eggs.

James finds 4 eggs.

Tara finds five times as many as James, which is 5 * 4 = 20 eggs.

Winnie finds 4 less than Tara, which is 20 - 4 = 16 eggs.

Noah finds half as many as Winnie, which is 16 / 2 = 8 eggs.

Oscar finds four dozen eggs more than Tara and James combined. Tara and James found 4 + 20 = 24 eggs. Four dozen is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. So, Oscar finds 24 + 48 = 72 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by James, Tara, Winnie, Noah, and Oscar: 4 + 20 + 16 + 8 + 72 = 120 eggs.

How much money does he make in a week?,1539.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the first 2 complexes**

The first 2 complexes have 300 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these 2 complexes is:
300 + 300 = 600 apartments

**Step 2: Calculate the number of apartments in the last complex**

The last complex is 50% bigger than the other 2 combined, which means it is 1.5 times the number of apartments in the other 2 complexes. So, the number of apartments in the last complex is:
1.5 x 600 = 900 apartments

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of apartments**

The total number of apartments is the sum of the apartments in all 3 complexes:
600 + 900 = 1500 apartments

**Step 4: Calculate the number of collections per week**

Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each complex, so the total number of collections per week is:
2 collections/week x 3 complexes = 6 collections/week

**Step 5: Calculate the total amount earned per collection**

Oliver gets paid ¥0.45 per collection for each apartment, and there are 1500 apartments in total. So, the total amount earned per collection is:
1500 apartments x ¥0.45/apartment = ¥675 per collection

**Step 6: Calculate the total amount earned per week**

Since Oliver collects 6 times a week, the total amount earned per week is:
¥675/collection x 6 collections/week = ¥4050 per week

**Step 7: Calculate the tips earned per week**

Oliver earns 14% on tips, which is 0.14 x ¥4050 = ¥564 per week

**Step 8: Calculate the total amount earned per week**

The total amount earned per week is the sum of the regular earnings and the tips:
¥4050 + ¥564 = ¥4614 per week

Therefore, Oliver makes ¥4614 per week.",4614.0,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Oliver collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes.

The first 2 complexes have 300 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these two complexes is 2 * 300 = 600.

The last complex is 50% bigger than the other 2 combined, so we need to find 50% of 600 and add it to 600.

50% of 600 is 0.5 * 600 = 300.

So, the last complex has 600 + 300 = 900 apartments.

Now, Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 3 * 2 = 6.

The total number of apartments is 600 + 600 + 900 = 2100.

Oliver gets paid ¥0.45 per collection for each apartment, so the total amount he earns per collection is 2100 * ¥0.45 = ¥945.

Since he collects garbage 6 times a week, the total amount he earns per week is 6 * ¥945 = ¥5670.

He also earns 14% on tips, so we need to calculate 14% of ¥5670.

14% of ¥5670 is 0.14 * ¥5670 = ¥792.

So, the total amount Oliver makes in a week is ¥5670 + ¥792 = ¥6462.

Q: Oliver collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes. The first 2 have 300 apartments each and the last one is 50% bigger than the other 2 combined. Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each place and he gets paid ¥0.45 per collection for each apartment. He also earns 14% on tips. How much money does he make in a week?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes.
The first 2 complexes have 300 apartments each.
So, the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes is 300 + 300 = 600.

The last complex is 50% bigger than the other 2 combined, which means it is 1.5 times bigger.
So, the number of apartments in the last complex is 1.5 * 600 = 900.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apartments.
The total number of apartments is 600 + 900 = 1500.

Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each place.
So, the total number of collections per week is 2 * 1500 = 3000.

Oliver gets paid ¥0.45 per collection for each apartment.
So, the total amount he earns per week is 3000 * ¥0.45 = ¥1350.

He also earns 14% on tips.
To calculate the amount he earns on tips, we need to find 14% of ¥1350.
14% of ¥1350 is (14/100) * ¥1350 = ¥189.

Now, let's add the amount he earns per week and the amount he earns on tips.
The total amount he earns per week is ¥1350 + ¥189 = ¥1539.

3. Each of the rest of the trouts weighs 16 kilograms more than the second one. Since there are 5 more trouts, the weight of the third trout will be 31 + 16 = 47 kilograms, 
   the fourth trout will be 47 + 16 = 63 kilograms, 
   the fifth trout will be 63 + 16 = 79 kilograms,

He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 17. When he went back home, he inspected the beads further. Nine of them he picked up weren't beads, but actually beads, so he got rid of them. Seeing how upset Gabriel was, his father gave him a pouch of beads with 7 beads inside. How many beads did Gabriel end up with?",67.0,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Gabriel initially had 78 beads.

2. He dropped one-third of them. To find the number of beads he dropped, we multiply 78 by 1/3.
   78 * 1/3 = 78 / 3 = 26

   So, he dropped 26 beads.

3. After that, he found 17 beads that he had dropped. This means he had 26 - 17 = 9 beads left on the ground.

4. He went home and picked up 9 items that weren't beads but turned out to be beads. So, these 9 beads were added to his collection.

   Now, we need to add the beads he found later to the total number of beads he had left after picking up the dropped beads.
   He initially had 78 beads, lost 26, and found 17, so he was left with:
   78 - 26 = 52
   52 + 17 = 69

   Then, he picked up 9 ""beads"" that were actually beads. Adding these to his collection:
   69 + 9 = 78

   So, at this point, he has 78 beads again.

5. His father gave him a pouch of 7 beads. To find the final number of beads, we add the 7 beads to his current collection.
   78 + 7 = 85

Therefore, Gabriel ended up with 85 beads.",85.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Gabriel starts with 78 beads.

He drops one-third of them, which is 78 / 3 = 26 beads.

So, he has 78 - 26 = 52 beads left.

He finds 17 beads, but 9 of them are not beads, so he gets rid of them. This means he adds 17 - 9 = 8 beads to his collection.

Now, Gabriel has 52 + 8 = 60 beads.

His father gives him a pouch with 7 beads inside.

So, Gabriel ends up with 60 + 7 = 67 beads.

1. The first 22 seconds: 
90 kernels popped.

2. The next 22 seconds:
3 times the initial amount popped, 
3 * 90 = 270 kernels popped.

3. The next 22 seconds:
4 times the previous popping rate, 
4 * 270 = 1080 kernels popped.

4. The final 22 seconds:
Half the rate of the previous 22 seconds, 
1/2 * 1080 = 540 kernels popped.

5. Additional kernels popped after taking the pot off the heat: 
A quarter of the number that popped in the final 22 seconds, 
1/4 * 540 = 135 kernels popped.

Now, we need to add up all the kernels popped:
90 + 270 + 1080 + 540 + 135 = 2115 kernels popped.

Since each kernel popped results in one piece of popcorn, Alejandro has 2115 pieces of popcorn.

6. Alejandro gives 1/5 of the popcorn to his brother Tariq:
1/5 * 2115 = 423 pieces of popcorn given to Tariq.

To find out how many pieces Alejandro has left, we need to subtract the amount given to Tariq from the total:
2115 - 423 = 1692 pieces of popcorn.

So, Alejandro has 1692 pieces of popcorn to eat.",1692.0,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 22 seconds, 90 kernels pop. 
2. In the next 22 seconds, the kernels pop 3 times the amount in the first 22 seconds, so 3 * 90 = 270 kernels pop.
3. So, in the first 44 seconds, a total of 90 + 270 = 360 kernels pop.
4. In the next 22 seconds, the kernels pop 4 times the initial rate, so 4 * 90 = 360 kernels pop.
5. So, in the first 66 seconds, a total of 360 + 360 = 720 kernels pop.
6. In the final 22 seconds, the kernels pop at half the rate of the past 22 seconds, so 360 / 2 = 180 kernels pop.
7. So, in total, 720 + 180 = 900 kernels pop.
8. A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds pop again from the residual heat, which is (1/4) * 180 = 45 kernels.
9. Since a total of 900 kernels popped initially, and 45 popped again, there are 900 + 45 = 945 kernels in total.
10. Alejandro gives 1/5 of the total kernels to his brother Tariq, which is (1/5) * 945 = 189 kernels.

The total number of green and black cubes = 4 + 20 = 24.

Since there are 40 cubes in total, the number of white cubes = 40 - 24 = 16.

To find the percentage of white cubes, we divide the number of white cubes by the total number of cubes and multiply by 100.

Now that we have the ages of Arash, Ali, and Oscar, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 3:
