Sofia bought 6 dozen eclairs, 7 dozen cookies, and 8 dozen muffins. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of each type of dessert.

The cost of eclairs is $18 per dozen.
She bought 6 dozen eclairs. 
So, the total cost of eclairs is 6 * $18 = $108.

The cost of cookies is $74 per dozen.
She bought 7 dozen cookies.
So, the total cost of cookies is 7 * $74 = $518.

The cost of muffins is $116 per dozen.
She bought 8 dozen muffins.
So, the total cost of muffins is 8 * $116 = $928.

But as I pour it, I spill 5 liters of the peach drink. How much water is in the remaining 31 liters?",7.0,"To find the amount of water in the remaining 31 liters, we need to calculate the amount of water in the peach drink and the lemon drink separately, and then add them together.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the peach drink**

You have 20 liters of peach drink that is 1/5 water. To find the amount of water in the peach drink, multiply the total amount of peach drink by 1/5.

20 liters x 1/5 = 20 x 0.2 = 4 liters of water in the peach drink.

However, you spilled 5 liters of the peach drink. So, the amount of peach drink left is:

20 liters - 5 liters = 15 liters of peach drink left.

The amount of water in the remaining peach drink is:

15 liters x 1/5 = 15 x 0.2 = 3 liters of water in the remaining peach drink.

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the lemon drink**

You have 16 liters of lemon drink that is 1/4 water. To find the amount of water in the lemon drink, multiply the total amount of lemon drink by 1/4.

16 liters x 1/4 = 16 x 0.25 = 4 liters of water in the lemon drink.

**Step 3: Add the amount of water in the peach drink and lemon drink**

Now, add the amount of water in the remaining peach drink (3 liters) and the lemon drink (4 liters) to find the total amount of water in the remaining 31 liters.

3 liters + 4 liters = 7 liters of water.

So, there are 7 liters of water in the remaining 31 liters of peach and lemon drink.",31.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's find out how much water is in the 20 liters of peach drink.
The peach drink is 1/5 water, so the amount of water in 20 liters is 20 * (1/5) = 4 liters.

Next, let's find out how much water is in the 16 liters of lemon drink.
The lemon drink is 1/4 water, so the amount of water in 16 liters is 16 * (1/4) = 4 liters.

Now, let's add the peach drink and lemon drink together, but subtract the 5 liters that were spilled.
The total amount of drink is 20 + 16 - 5 = 31 liters.

The amount of water in the peach drink is 4 liters, and the amount of water in the lemon drink is 4 liters.
So, the total amount of water in the remaining 31 liters is 4 + 4 = 8 liters.

However, we also need to consider the water that was spilled. Since the peach drink is 1/5 water, the amount of water that was spilled is 5 * (1/5) = 1 liter.

So, the total amount of water in the remaining 31 liters is 8 + 1 = 9 liters.

The answer is 9.",9.0,0,"Q: I have 20 liters of peach drink that are 1/5 water and I wish to add it to 16 liters of lemon drink that is 1/4 water. But as I pour it, I spill 5 liters of the peach drink. How much water is in the remaining 31 liters?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the peach drink.
The peach drink is 1/5 water, so the amount of water in 20 liters of peach drink is 20 * (1/5) = 4 liters.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the lemon drink.
The lemon drink is 1/4 water, so the amount of water in 16 liters of lemon drink is 16 * (1/4) = 4 liters.

Now, let's consider the peach drink that was spilled.
The amount of peach drink spilled is 5 liters, which contains 5 * (1/5) = 1 liter of water.

So, the total amount of water in the remaining 31 liters is the sum of the water in the peach drink and lemon drink, minus the water spilled from the peach drink.
The amount of water in the peach drink is 4 liters, and the amount of water in the lemon drink is 4 liters.
The amount of water spilled from the peach drink is 1 liter.

If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 6 hours if she spends 2/4 of the time running and three-sixths of the time walking?",36.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jasmine can skip at 6 miles per hour.

Since she can skip at a rate of speed that is 3/5 as fast as she can run, we can set up an equation to find her running speed:

Let r be her running speed. Then, 3/5r = 6

To solve for r, we can multiply both sides by 5/3:

r = 6 × 5/3
r = 10 miles per hour

2. Jasmine can run five times faster than she can walk.

Let w be her walking speed. Then, 5w = 10 (since she can run five times faster than she can walk)

To solve for w, we can divide both sides by 5:

w = 10/5
w = 2 miles per hour

3. Jasmine spends 2/4 of the time running and three-sixths of the time walking.

First, let's simplify the fractions:

2/4 = 1/2
3/6 = 1/2

So, Jasmine spends 1/2 of the time running and 1/2 of the time walking.

4. Since Jasmine can skip at 6 miles per hour, we can find the total distance she can travel in 6 hours:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 6 × 6
Distance = 36 miles

However, we need to find the total distance she can travel if she spends 1/2 of the time running and 1/2 of the time walking. Let's calculate the distance she can travel in each mode:

Running distance = Running speed × Running time
Running distance = 10 × 3 (since she spends 1/2 of the time running)
Running distance = 30 miles

Walking distance = Walking speed × Walking time
Walking distance = 2 × 3 (since she spends 1/2 of the time walking)
Walking distance = 6 miles

Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance + Skipping distance
Total distance = 30 + 6 + 36
Total distance = 72 miles

Therefore, Jasmine can travel 72 miles in 6 hours if she spends 1/2 of the time running and 1/2 of the time walking.",2.0,0,"Let's break this down step by step.

Jasmine can skip at a rate of 6 miles per hour.

Since she can skip at a rate of speed that is 3/5 as fast as she can run, we need to find out how fast she can run.

Let's call her running speed 'R' and skipping speed 'S'. 
We know S = 3/5 * R 
Given S = 6, so 6 = (3/5) * R 
To find R, multiply both sides by 5/3, so R = 6 * (5/3)
R = 10 

Now that we know Jasmine's running speed (10 miles per hour), we can calculate her walking speed. Since she can run five times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is 1/5 of her running speed.

Walking speed = 1/5 * Running speed
Walking speed = 1/5 * 10
Walking speed = 2 miles per hour

Now we know Jasmine can run at 10 miles per hour, walk at 2 miles per hour, and skip at 6 miles per hour.

She spends 2/4 (or 1/2) of the time running, and 3/6 (or 1/2) of the time walking. Since she spends the remaining time skipping, the time she spends skipping is 1 - (1/2 + 1/2) = 0. So she actually spends the whole 6 hours skipping.

Since she skips at 6 miles per hour, in 6 hours she will travel 6 * 6 = 36 miles.

Q: According to its nutritional info, a bag of breads has 275 calories per serving. If a 300 ounces bag has 5 servings, how many ounces can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2360 and you have already consumed 1700 calories?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's find out how many calories are in the entire bag of breads.
There are 5 servings in the bag.
Each serving has 275 calories.
So, the total number of calories in the bag is 5 * 275 = 1375 calories.

Next, let's find out how many calories you can still consume to reach your daily target.
Your daily calorie target is 2360 calories.
You have already consumed 1700 calories.
So, the number of calories you can still consume is 2360 - 1700 = 660 calories.

Now, let's find out how many ounces you can eat to reach your remaining calorie target.
Each serving has 275 calories.
You can consume 660 calories.
So, the number of servings you can eat is 660 / 275 = 2.4 servings.

Since the bag has 5 servings, you can eat 2.4 servings, which is equivalent to 2.4/5 * 300 ounces.

To find the number of ounces, we multiply 2.4 by 300 and divide by 5.
2.4 * 300 = 720
720 / 5 = 144

James sells lilies for €1.26 per bunch. When rounded to the nearest dollar, this is €1. 
He sells 6 bunches of lilies. 
So, the total amount of money from lilies is 6 * €1 = €6.
The answer is €6.

James sells daisies for €2.53 per bunch. When rounded to the nearest dollar, this is €2.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of potted plants Tara already has**

Tara has 9 potted plants on each of the 64 window ledges. To find the total number of potted plants she already has, we multiply the number of plants per ledge by the number of ledges:

9 plants/ledge × 64 ledges = 576 plants

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of potted plants Tara will give away**

Tara will give away 6 potted plants from each of the 64 window ledges. To find the total number of plants she will give away, we multiply the number of plants given away per ledge by the number of ledges:

Theo watched TV for a certain number of hours each night. We need to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Thursday. 

To do this, we'll first find out how many hours of TV he watched from Thursday to Saturday. 

- On Tuesday and Wednesday, he watched a total of 2 nights * 6 hours/night = 12 hours.
- On Thursday, he watched an unknown number of 30-minute episodes. Let's call this number x. Each episode is 0.5 hours long, so he watched 0.5x hours on Thursday.
- On Friday, he watched 2 hours + 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours of TV.
- On Saturday, he watched 3 nights * 4 hours/night = 12 hours of TV.

In total, from Thursday to Saturday, he watched 0.5x + 2.5 + 12 hours of TV. We are given that he watched a total of 29 hours of TV in all.

So, we can write the equation: 0.5x + 2.5 + 12 = 29.

Now, let's solve the equation for x.

First, combine the constants: 2.5 + 12 = 14.5.
So, the equation becomes: 0.5x + 14.5 = 29.

Next, subtract 14.5 from both sides: 0.5x = 29 - 14.5 = 14.5.

A: Let's think step by step.
The ratio of sugar to water is 53:24.
This means that for every 53 parts of sugar, there are 24 parts of water.
The total number of parts is 53 + 24 = 77.
Since the total number of parts is 77, and the ratio of sugar to total parts is 53:77, we can find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used by dividing 53 by 77.
So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used is 53 / 77 = 0.688 (approximately).
However, since the ratio is given in whole numbers, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.
Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used is 53 / 77 = 53/77.
But we want to find the actual number of teaspoonfuls, not a fraction. To do this, we can multiply the fraction by the total number of parts (77) to get the actual number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,25.0,"To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

**Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**

Since there are 6 sides on the die and 3 of them are greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6), the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:

3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%

**Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**

The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 (since 3 out of 6 sides are even).

To roll two even numbers in a row, we need to multiply this probability by itself:

(1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%

**Comparing the probabilities:**

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50% or 0.5, while the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 25% or 0.25.

To find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we subtract the smaller probability from the larger one:

0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.25 * 100 = 25%

So, it is 25% more likely that Umar rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.",3.0,0,"I see that the example problems were all basic arithmetic operations, but the final question you provided is about probability. I'll try to break down the problem step by step:

Let's think step by step.

To find out how much more likely it is that Umar rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probability of both events and then find the difference between them.

There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. 

First, let's find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 
The possible outcomes are 4, 5, and 6, which are 3 out of the 6 possible outcomes. 
So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 0.5 or 50%.

Now, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: 
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. 
For the first roll, the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 0.5. 
For the second roll, given that the first roll was an even number, the probability of rolling another even number is 2/6 = 1/3 (since there are now only 2 even numbers left out of 6 possible outcomes).
So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.5 * 1/3 = 0.1667 or 16.67%.

Now, let's find the difference between the two probabilities to determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row:
The difference is 50% - 16.67% = 33.33%.

The answer is 33.33%.",33.33,0,"I'll provide the corrected reasoning and answer in the examples format.

Q: Umar is rolling a six-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's consider the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

Next, let's consider the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 1/2, and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 1/2. Since these are independent events, we multiply the probabilities to get the probability of both events occurring: (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, let's find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row: 50% - 25% = 25%.

To express this as a percentage, we can simply write the answer as 25%.

Let's break down the information:

* There are 69 ladybugs.

To find four-sixths of 69, we can multiply 69 by 4/6.

First, let's simplify the fraction 4/6. We can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2 to get 2/3.

So, we need to multiply 69 by 2/3.

69 × 2/3 = (69 × 2) / 3

Umar starts with 9 pen pals.
He stops being pen pals with 3 of them.

Since Umar responds in kind, each pen pal sends and receives 4 * 10 = 40 pages a week.
With 6 pen pals, the total number of pages he receives is 6 * 40 = 240 pages a week.

He can write a page every 6 minutes.
To find the time it takes to write 240 pages, we need to multiply the time per page by the total number of pages.
Time per page is 6 minutes, and total pages is 240.
So, the time to write 240 pages is 6 * 240 = 1440 minutes.

How many engineers are left if 26 artists stayed at the conference?",66.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Initially, there were 64 artists and 51 engineers, so the total number of people at the conference was:

64 (artists) + 51 (engineers) = 115

After half an hour, one-fifth of the total number of people left. To find the number of people who left, we need to calculate one-fifth of the total number of people:

1/5 × 115 = 23

So, 23 people left the conference.

Since 26 artists stayed at the conference, the number of artists who left is:

64 (initial artists) - 26 (artists who stayed) = 38

Now, let's find the number of engineers who left. We know that 23 people left in total, and 38 of them were artists. So, the number of engineers who left is:

23 (total people who left) - 38 (artists who left) = -15

However, we can't have a negative number of engineers who left. This means that the number of engineers who left is actually 38 - 23 = 15.

Initially, there were 51 engineers, and 15 of them left. So, the number of engineers who stayed is:

51 (initial engineers) - 15 (engineers who left) = 36

Step 1: Calculate the initial total value of Keisha's shares
- Number of shares: 17
- Price per share: ₣75
- Total value = Number of shares * Price per share
- Total value = 17 * 75
- Total value = ₣1275

Step 2: Calculate the value of the shares after the first year, when the price increases by 60%
- Increase percentage: 60%
- Increase amount = 60% of ₣1275
- Increase amount = 0.60 * ₣1275
- Increase amount = ₣765

She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of laser tag, have $6 in pinball tokens, and get to ride the roller coaster eight times. A round of laser tag is $6. The roller coaster cost $11 a ride. How many friends can she invite?",1.0,"To find out how many friends Sofia can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

1. Laser tag: Sofia wants to play one round, but we don't know how many friends she's inviting yet. Let's call the number of friends 'x'. The total cost for laser tag will be 6 * (x + 1), because Sofia is also playing. 
2. Pinball tokens: Sofia wants $6 in pinball tokens, so this cost is fixed at $6.
3. Roller coaster: Sofia wants to ride the roller coaster 8 times, and each ride costs $11. The total cost for the roller coaster will be 8 * 11 = $88.

Now, let's add up the costs for laser tag, pinball tokens, and the roller coaster. We'll use the expression for laser tag cost, which is 6 * (x + 1).

Total cost = 6 * (x + 1) + 6 + 88

Simplifying the expression, we get:
Total cost = 6x + 6 + 6 + 88
Total cost = 6x + 100

We know that Sofia's mom has a budget of $200. So, we can set up the equation:
6x + 100 = 200

Now, let's solve for x:
6x + 100 = 200
6x = 200 - 100
6x = 100
x = 100 / 6

She wants to play one round of laser tag, so that will cost $6.
She also wants $6 in pinball tokens, so that's an additional $6.
She wants to ride the roller coaster 8 times, and each ride costs $11.

The total cost for the laser tag, pinball tokens, and roller coaster rides is 6 + 6 + 88 = 100.
This leaves $200 - $100 = $100 for other expenses or for inviting friends.
Since each friend will cost $6 (laser tag + roller coaster rides), the number of friends she can invite is 100 / 6 = 16.67.
However, since she can't invite a fraction of a friend, we'll round down to 16 friends.

The answer is 16.",16.0,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many friends Sofia can invite.

Sofia's mom has $200 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to spend it on the following:
- One round of laser tag for each guest (Sofia and her friends). Since a round of laser tag costs $6, and she will have guests, the total cost for laser tag will be 7 * 6 = $42.
- Each guest will also get $6 in pinball tokens, so this will cost 7 * 6 = $42.
- She also wants to ride the roller coaster 8 times, but since there are friends and Sofia will ride the roller coaster, the total number of times the roller coaster will be ridden is 9, costing 9 * 11 = $99.

The total cost for the party is the cost for laser tag, the pinball tokens, and the roller coaster ride. 
Total cost = cost for laser tag + cost for pinball tokens + cost for roller coaster = 42 + 42 + 99 = 183

Sofia's mom has $200 budgeted for the party, and the party costs $183. To find out how much is left after the party, we subtract the cost from the budget.
Remaining budget = 200 - 183 = 17

However, it seems that the budget of $200 is not enough to pay for the costs described, so we'll solve the problem for the number of friends that Sofia can invite given a budget of $17 after subtracting the costs. Since it costs 6 dollars for 1 round of laser tag and 6 dollars in pinball tokens, we can find the number of friends that can get these for 17 dollars.
Since the cost of each guest is 6 + 6 = 12 dollars, we can find the number of friends that can get these for 17 dollars.
Number of friends = 17 / 12

To divide the number of friends that can get these for 17 dollars, we can use division. To help evaluate the problem, we can think of the division as asking how many groups of 12 dollars can fit into 17 dollars.

1. Calculate the total amount of money Liam spent on popcorn.
2. Determine the amount of money Liam had left after buying popcorn.
3. Calculate the amount of money Liam spent on pretzels.
4. Determine the number of pretzels Liam bought.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Liam spent on popcorn.

Liam bought 4 bags of popcorn at 25 cents each. To find the total amount spent on popcorn, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

4 bags × 25 cents/bag = 100 cents

Since there are 100 cents in 1 dollar, we can convert the total amount spent on popcorn to dollars:

100 cents = $1

Step 2: Determine the amount of money Liam had left after buying popcorn.

Liam had ₣1000 initially and spent $1 on popcorn. To find the amount of money left, we subtract the amount spent from the initial amount:

₣1000 - $1 = ₣999

However, we are given that Liam had 8% of his money left in change. This means that the amount left is 8% of ₣1000. To find the amount left, we can calculate 8% of ₣1000:

8% of ₣1000 = 0.08 × ₣1000 = ₣80

Since Liam had ₣80 left, we can set up an equation to find the amount spent:

₣1000 - x = ₣80

where x is the amount spent.

Solving for x, we get:

x = ₣920

This means that Liam spent ₣920 on popcorn and pretzels.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Liam spent on pretzels.

We already know that Liam spent $1 on popcorn. To find the amount spent on pretzels, we subtract the amount spent on popcorn from the total amount spent:

₣920 - $1 = ₣919

Since there are 100 cents in 1 dollar, we can convert the amount spent on pretzels to cents:

₣919 = 91900 cents

Step 4: Determine the number of pretzels Liam bought.

Each pretzel costs 100 cents. To find the number of pretzels Liam bought, we divide the amount spent on pretzels by the cost per pretzel:

91900 cents ÷ 100 cents/pretzel = 919 pretzels

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the number of pretzels Liam bought, given that he had ₣80 left, which is 8% of ₣1000.

Let's re-evaluate the problem:

Liam had ₣1000 initially and spent 8% of his money on popcorn and pretzels. To find the amount spent, we can calculate 8% of ₣1000:

8% of ₣1000 = 0.08 × ₣1000 = ₣80

This means that Liam spent ₣920 on popcorn and pretzels.

We already know that Liam spent $1 on popcorn. To find the amount spent on pretzels, we subtract the amount spent on popcorn from the total amount spent:

Q: The vending machines sell popcorn for 25 cents and pretzels for 100 cents. Liam spent ₣1000 and got 4 bags of popcorn and had 8% of his money left in change. How many pretzels did he buy?

A: Let's think step by step.

Liam starts with ₣1000.
He buys 4 bags of popcorn for 25 cents each.
So, the total amount spent on popcorn is 4 * 25 = ₣100.
He has 8% of his money left in change.
This means he spent 92% of his money.
So, the amount spent on pretzels is 92% of ₣1000.
To find 92% of ₣1000, we multiply ₣1000 by 0.92.
So, the amount spent on pretzels is ₣920.
Since each pretzel costs ₣1, the number of pretzels bought is ₣920 / ₣1 = 920.
The answer is 920.",920.0,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Liam initially had ₣1000. He spent some money on popcorn and pretzels, and he had ₣100 left, which is 8% of his initial amount.

Let's find the total amount Liam spent on popcorn and pretzels. 
Liam starts with ₣1000.
He has ₣100 left, which is 8% of ₣1000.
So, 8% of ₣1000 is ₣100.

To find the total amount spent, we can divide ₣100 by 8% to find 100% or the total amount. 
100% = 100/8 = 12.5
100% = ₣1000

Now, we know Liam spent ₣900 on popcorn and pretzels.

Liam buys popcorn for 25 cents (₣0.25) and pretzels for 100 cents (₣1). 
So, for every 1 pretzel he buys, he can buy 4 popcorns with the same amount of money. 

Let's assume the number of pretzels Liam bought is x.
Then, the number of popcorns he bought is 4x.

The total amount spent on popcorn is 4x * ₣0.25 = ₣x
The total amount spent on pretzels is x * ₣1 = ₣x

The total amount spent is the sum of the amount spent on popcorn and the amount spent on pretzels.
The total amount spent is ₣x + ₣x = ₣2x

We know the total amount spent is ₣900.
So, ₣2x = ₣900.

We can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find x.
x = ₣900 / 2
x = ₣450

Since x is the number of pretzels, Liam bought 45 pretzels.
The answer is 45.",45.0,0

Area = Length * Width
660 = 5 * Width

To find the width, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5.
660 / 5 = Width
Width = 132

Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter of the room. 
The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (Length + Width).
Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (5 + 132)

**Step 1: Calculate the number of blue cards**

We are told that there are 55% more blue cards than orange cards. To find the number of blue cards, we need to calculate 55% of the number of orange cards and add it to the number of orange cards.

Number of orange cards = 80
55% of 80 = 0.55 × 80 = 44

Therefore, there are 408 cards of all mentioned colors.",408.0,1,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

First, let's find out how many blue cards there are. We know that there are 55% more blue cards than orange cards. To find 55% of the number of orange cards, we multiply the number of orange cards by 0.55.

Let's think step by step.
There are 80 orange cards.
55% more blue cards than orange cards means we need to find 55% of 80.
55% is the same as 0.55.
So, 55% of 80 is 80 * 0.55 = 44.
This means there are 44 more blue cards than orange cards.
So, the total number of blue cards is 80 + 44 = 124.

Next, let's find out how many green cards there are. We know that the number of green cards is equal to the sum of orange and blue cards.

The number of green cards is equal to the sum of orange and blue cards.
The number of orange cards is 80.
The number of blue cards is 124.

6 remoras * 8 feet/remora = 48 feet

Now, we need to find the percentage of the dolphin's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. To do this, we can divide the combined length of the remoras by the dolphin's body length and multiply by 100.

(48 feet / 480 feet) * 100 = 10%

The total length of the remoras is 6 * 96 = 576 inches.

To find the percentage of the dolphin's body length that the remoras make up, we need to divide the total length of the remoras by the length of the dolphin and multiply by 100.

So, the percentage is (576 / 480) * 100.

First, let's divide 576 by 480:
576 ÷ 480 = 1.2

Now, multiply by 100:
1.2 * 100 = 120

The answer is 120.",120.0,0,"I'll provide the corrected reasoning and answer in the examples format.

Q: Umar saw a 480-foot dolphin with 6 96-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remoras?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the combined length of the remoras. Since there are 6 remoras, each 96 inches long, we can find the total length by multiplying the number of remoras by their individual length:

6 remoras * 96 inches/remora = 576 inches

However, we need to convert the length of the dolphin from feet to inches to make the comparison. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the dolphin's length as follows:

480 feet * 12 inches/foot = 5760 inches

Now that we have the combined length of the remoras in inches and the dolphin's length in inches, we can find the percentage of the dolphin's body length that is the combined length of the remoras:

(Combined length of remoras / Dolphin's length) * 100
= (576 inches / 5760 inches) * 100
= 0.1 * 100
= 10.0%

However, this is not the percentage we are looking for. We want to find the percentage of the dolphin's body length that is the combined length of the remoras. To do this, we need to divide the combined length of the remoras by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100:

(Combined length of remoras / Dolphin's length) * 100
= (576 inches / 5760 inches) * 100
= 0.1 * 100
= 10.0%

But we need to express this as a percentage of the dolphin's body length, not as a percentage of the total length. To do this, we need to divide the combined length of the remoras by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100:

(Combined length of remoras / Dolphin's length) * 100
= (576 inches / 5760 inches) * 100
= 0.1 * 100
= 10.0%

However, we can simplify this by converting the combined length of the remoras to a percentage of the dolphin's length:

(Combined length of remoras / Dolphin's length) * 100
= (576 inches / 5760 inches) * 100
= (96 inches / 960 inches) * 100
= 10.0%

But we can simplify this further by realizing that the combined length of the remoras is 96 inches, which is 1/10 of the dolphin's length. Therefore, the percentage of the dolphin's body length that is the combined length of the remoras is:

(96 inches / 960 inches) * 100
= (1/10) * 100
= 10.0%

However, we can simplify this even further by realizing that the combined length of the remoras is 1/10 of the dolphin's length, which means that it is 10% of the dolphin's length.

**Step 2: Calculate the total ounces used for medium cubes**

Santiago makes 15 medium cubes, and each cube uses 11 ounces. So, the total ounces used for medium cubes is:

6 kilograms less than that is 24 - 6 = 18 kilograms.

So, each donkey needs 18 kilograms of feed.

Now, we need to find out the total amount of feed Ibrahim needs for all the horses and donkeys.

There are 22 horses, and each horse needs 12 kilograms of feed. So, the total amount of feed for the horses is 22 * 12 = 264 kilograms.

There are 45 donkeys, and each donkey needs 18 kilograms of feed. So, the total amount of feed for the donkeys is 45 * 18 = 810 kilograms.

To find the total amount of feed Ibrahim needs, we add the amount of feed for the horses and the donkeys:
264 + 810 = 1074 kilograms.

1. Calculate the number of occupied rooms initially.
2. Calculate the number of new patients admitted in 2 weeks.
3. Calculate the total number of occupied rooms after 2 weeks.
4. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms after 2 weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of occupied rooms initially.
The care facility has a capacity of 1900 rooms with 2/5 occupied.
2/5 of 1900 = (2/5) * 1900 = 760

If the brownie cost ¥11 and the kiwi pie cost ¥27, how much did Oscar earn for two days?",1839.0,"To find out how much Oscar earned in total, we need to find out how many boxes of brownies and kiwi pies he sold on each day and then multiply that by the cost of each item.

On Friday, Oscar sold 29 boxes of brownies. 
On Saturday, he sold 11 more boxes of brownies than on Friday, which is 29 + 11 = 40 boxes of brownies.

For kiwi pie, on Friday, he sold 12 fewer boxes than on Saturday. Since he sold 26 boxes on Saturday, we can find out the number of boxes on Friday by subtracting 12 from 26: 26 - 12 = 14 boxes.

Now, let's calculate Oscar's total earnings for each day:
- On Friday, Oscar sold 29 boxes of brownies at ¥11 each, so his earnings from brownies on Friday is 29 * 11 = ¥319.
- On Friday, Oscar sold 14 boxes of kiwi pie at ¥27 each, so his earnings from kiwi pie on Friday is 14 * 27 = ¥378.
- On Saturday, Oscar sold 40 boxes of brownies at ¥11 each, so his earnings from brownies on Saturday is 40 * 11 = ¥440.
- On Saturday, Oscar sold 26 boxes of kiwi pie at ¥27 each, so his earnings from kiwi pie on Saturday is 26 * 27 = ¥702.

- His earnings from brownies for the two days are 319 + 440 = ¥759.
- His earnings from kiwi pie for the two days are 378 + 702 = ¥1080.

180 feet (length of the flower bed) - 3 feet (width of each plant)",3.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Kimia's flower bed is 180 feet long.
She needs to leave 15.0 feet between every plant.
The width of each flower is 3 feet.
So, the total space required for each plant, including the space between them, is 3 + 15 = 18 feet.

To find out how many plants Kimia can fit in her flower bed, we need to divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:
180 / 18 = 10

However, Kimia already owns 11 flowers, so she needs to buy 10 more flowers to fill up her flower bed.

Each flowering plant costs ¥3 at the store.
So, the total amount of money Kimia will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:
10 * ¥3 = ¥30

The answer is ¥30.",30.0,0,"I'll provide the corrected reasoning and answer.

Q: Kimia has a flower bed that is 180 feet long. Kimia wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Kimia's flowers grow 3 feet wide so she needs to leave 15.0 feet between every plant. Kimia already owns 11 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ¥3 at the store, how much money will Kimia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many plants Kimia can fit in her flower bed. To do this, we need to find the total space required for each plant, including the space between them.

The width of each plant is 3 feet, and the space between each plant is 15.0 feet. So, the total space required for each plant is 3 + 15 = 18 feet.

Now, we need to find out how many plants Kimia can fit in her flower bed. The length of the flower bed is 180 feet. To find the number of plants, we divide the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:

180 / 18 = 10

So, Kimia can fit 10 plants in her flower bed. Since Kimia already owns 11 flowers, she needs to buy 10 - 11 = -1 more flowers. However, this is not possible, as Kimia cannot buy a negative number of flowers.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Since Kimia already owns 11 flowers, she needs to find the space for these 11 flowers in her flower bed. The width of each plant is 3 feet, and the space between each plant is 15.0 feet. So, the total space required for each plant is 3 + 15 = 18 feet.

The length of the flower bed is 180 feet. To find the number of spaces between the plants, we divide the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:

180 / 18 = 10

However, this is the number of spaces between the plants, not the number of plants. Since Kimia already owns 11 flowers, we need to find the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed, including the 11 flowers Kimia already owns.

Let's assume the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed is x. Then, the total number of plants, including the 11 flowers Kimia already owns, is x + 11.

The total space required for each plant is 18 feet. The total space required for x + 11 plants is 18(x + 11).

The length of the flower bed is 180 feet. The total space required for x + 11 plants is equal to the length of the flower bed:

18(x + 11) = 180

Now, we can solve for x:

18x + 198 = 180

Subtract 198 from both sides:

18x = -18

Divide both sides by 18:

x = -1

However, this is not possible, as Kimia cannot have a negative number of plants.

Let's re-evaluate the problem again. Since Kimia already owns 11 flowers, she needs to find the space for these 11 flowers in her flower bed. The width of each plant is 3 feet, and the space between each plant is 15.0 feet. So, the total space required for each plant is 3 + 15 = 18 feet.

The length of the flower bed is 180 feet. To find the number of spaces between the plants, we divide the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:

180 / 18 = 10

However, this is the number of spaces between the plants, not the number of plants. Since Kimia already owns 11 flowers, we need to find the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed, including the 11 flowers Kimia already owns.

Let's assume the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed is x. Then, the total number of plants, including the 11 flowers Kimia already owns, is x + 11.

The total space required for each plant is 18 feet. The total space required for x + 11 plants is 18(x + 11).

The length of the flower bed is 180 feet. The total space required for x + 11 plants is equal to the length of the flower bed:

18(x + 11) = 180

Now, we can solve for x:

18x + 198 = 180

Subtract 198 from both sides:

18x = -18

Divide both sides by 18:

x = -1

However, this is not possible, as Kimia cannot have a negative number of plants.

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct,Fatima can peel 10 clams a minute and saute 30 clams in 7 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 90 clams?,30.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Peeling 90 clams:**

Fatima can peel 10 clams per minute. To find out how long it will take her to peel 90 clams, we can divide 90 by 10:

90 ÷ 10 = 9 minutes

So, it will take Fatima 9 minutes to peel 90 clams.

**Sauteing 90 clams:**

Fatima can saute 30 clams in 7 minutes. To find out how long it will take her to saute 90 clams, we can divide 90 by 30:

90 ÷ 30 = 3

Since 3 is less than 7, it will take Fatima less than 7 minutes to saute 90 clams. To be more precise, we can multiply 3 by 7 (the time it takes to saute 30 clams) and subtract the result from 7:

7 - (3 × 7) = 7 - 21 = -14 (this doesn't make sense, so we'll try another approach)

Alternatively, we can divide 90 by 30 and multiply the result by 7:

(90 ÷ 30) × 7 = 3 × 7 = 21 minutes

However, this is the time it would take to saute 90 clams in batches of 30. Since Fatima can saute 30 clams in 7 minutes, we can divide 90 by 30 and multiply the result by 7:

(90 ÷ 30) × 7 = 3 × 7 = 21 minutes

But we can also divide 90 by 30 and multiply the result by the time it takes to saute 30 clams:

(90 ÷ 30) × 7 = 3 × 7 = 21 minutes

Fatima can peel 10 clams a minute.
She needs to peel 90 clams.
So, the time it takes to peel the clams is 90 / 10 = 9 minutes.

However, we also need to consider the time it takes to saute the clams. Fatima can saute 30 clams in 7 minutes.
To find out how many sets of 30 clams are in 90 clams, we divide 90 by 30, which is 3.
Since it takes 7 minutes to saute 30 clams, it will take 3 * 7 = 21 minutes to saute 90 clams.

In total, it will take Fatima 9 minutes to peel the clams and 21 minutes to saute them. Since these tasks are done sequentially, we add the times together: 9 + 21 = 30 minutes.

If 66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 27-mile walk, in minutes?",90.0,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Find Emma's speed on the beach and on the sidewalk.
Let's denote Emma's speed on the beach as 'x' miles per hour. Since Emma walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, her speed on the sidewalk will be 4x miles per hour.

Step 2: Use the information that she walks 66 minutes on the beach to find her speed on the beach.
First, convert 66 minutes to hours:
66 minutes = 66/60 = 1.1 hours.

Given that Emma walks 11 miles on the beach in 1.1 hours, we can find her speed on the beach by dividing the distance by the time:
Speed on the beach (x) = Distance / Time = 11 miles / 1.1 hours = 10 miles per hour.

Step 3: Find Emma's speed on the sidewalk.
Since her speed on the sidewalk is four times her speed on the beach, we can multiply her speed on the beach by 4 to get her speed on the sidewalk:
Speed on the sidewalk = 4 * 10 = 40 miles per hour.

Step 4: Find the time it takes to walk 16 miles on the sidewalk.
Time = Distance / Speed. Now that we know her speed on the sidewalk, we can calculate the time it takes to walk 16 miles:
Time on the sidewalk = 16 miles / 40 miles per hour = 0.4 hours.

Convert 0.4 hours to minutes:
0.4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 24 minutes.

Step 5: Find the total time it takes for Emma to complete the entire 27-mile walk.
We know it takes 66 minutes to walk on the beach and 24 minutes to walk on the sidewalk. To find the total time, add these two times:
Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk = 66 minutes + 24 minutes = 90 minutes.

Q: Emma walks 27 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 11 miles of walking on the beach and 16 miles of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Emma walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 27-mile walk, in minutes?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Emma to walk 11 miles on the beach. We know that she spends 66 minutes walking on the beach, but we don't know her speed. Let's call her speed on the beach ""x"" miles per minute. Then, we can set up the equation:

11 miles = 66 minutes * x miles/minute

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 66:

x = 11 miles / 66 minutes
x = 0.1667 miles/minute (approximately)

Now that we know Emma's speed on the beach, we can find out how long it takes her to walk 16 miles on the sidewalk. We know that she walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk, so her speed on the sidewalk is 4x miles/minute. We can set up the equation:

16 miles = time * 4x miles/minute

We can solve for time by dividing both sides by 4x:

time = 16 miles / (4 * 0.1667 miles/minute)
time = 16 miles / 0.6668 miles/minute
time = 24 minutes

Now that we know how long it takes Emma to walk on the sidewalk, we can find out how long it takes her to complete the entire 27-mile walk. We can add the time it takes her to walk on the beach and the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk:

Total time = 66 minutes + 24 minutes
Total time = 90 minutes

**Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs Winnie eats in the first 60 days**

Winnie eats 4 eggs a day for 60 days, so the total number of eggs eaten in the first 60 days is:
4 eggs/day × 60 days = 240 eggs

**Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs Winnie eats in the next 96 days**

Winnie increases her egg consumption to 5 eggs a day for 96 days, so the total number of eggs eaten in the next 96 days is:
5 eggs/day × 96 days = 480 eggs

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of eggs Winnie eats in 156 days**

Add the number of eggs eaten in the first 60 days and the next 96 days:
240 eggs + 480 eggs = 720 eggs

**Step 4: Convert the total number of eggs to dozens**

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, divide the total number of eggs by 12 to get the number of dozens:
720 eggs ÷ 12 = 60 dozens

Therefore, Winnie will need 60 dozens of eggs for 156 days.",156.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Winnie eats 4 eggs a day for 60 days.
So, the total number of eggs she eats in 60 days is 4 * 60 = 240 eggs.

Then, she eats 5 eggs a day for 96 days.
So, the total number of eggs she eats in 96 days is 5 * 96 = 480 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs she eats in both periods.
So, the total number of eggs is 240 + 480 = 720 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens.
We do this by dividing the total number of eggs by 12.

So, the total number of dozens of eggs Winnie will need is 720 / 12 = 60.

Olivia finds 2 less than Emma, and Alejandro finds 1/2 as many as Olivia. How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?",56.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Tariq hid 9 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we can calculate the total number of eggs:
9 dozen x 12 eggs/dozen = 108 eggs

2. Noah finds 5 eggs. So, the number of eggs left is:
108 - 5 = 103 eggs

3. Emma finds four times as many as Noah. Since Noah found 5 eggs, Emma finds:
4 x 5 = 20 eggs

So, the number of eggs left is:
103 - 20 = 83 eggs

4. Olivia finds 2 less than Emma. Since Emma found 20 eggs, Olivia finds:
20 - 2 = 18 eggs

So, the number of eggs left is:
83 - 18 = 65 eggs

5. Alejandro finds 1/2 as many as Olivia. Since Olivia found 18 eggs, Alejandro finds:
18 / 2 = 9 eggs

So, the number of eggs left is:
65 - 9 = 56 eggs

Therefore, there are 56 eggs still hidden in the yard.",56.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many eggs Tariq hid in total. Since he hid 9 dozen eggs, we need to convert the dozens to individual eggs. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:

9 dozen eggs = 9 x 12 = 108 eggs

Now, let's calculate how many eggs each person found:

Noah finds 5 eggs.

Emma finds four times as many as Noah, so:
Emma finds 4 x 5 = 20 eggs.

Olivia finds 2 less than Emma, so:
Olivia finds 20 - 2 = 18 eggs.

Alejandro finds 1/2 as many as Olivia, so:
Alejandro finds 18 / 2 = 9 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs each person found:
5 (Noah) + 20 (Emma) + 18 (Olivia) + 9 (Alejandro) = 52 eggs

Since Tariq hid 108 eggs in total, and 52 eggs were found, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total to find the number of eggs still hidden:

Ali collects garbage 3 times a week from each place and he gets paid €0.4 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?,2538.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the first 3 complexes**

There are 3 complexes with 300 apartments each, so:
3 x 300 = 900 apartments

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of apartments in all 4 complexes**

The last complex is 35% bigger than the other 3 combined, which means it's 135% of the other 3 combined (100% + 35% = 135%). To find the number of apartments in the last complex, we need to calculate 135% of 900:
135% of 900 = 1.35 x 900 = 1215 apartments

Now, let's add the number of apartments in the first 3 complexes to the number of apartments in the last complex:
900 + 1215 = 2115 apartments

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of collections per week**

Ali collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex, and there are 4 complexes. So, the total number of collections per week is:
3 collections/week x 4 complexes = 12 collections/week

**Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Ali makes per week**

Ali gets paid €0.4 per collection for each apartment. Since there are 2115 apartments and he collects garbage 12 times a week, the total amount of money he makes per week is:
2115 apartments x €0.4/apartment x 12 collections/week = €10140 per week

Therefore, Ali makes €10140 per week.",10140.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

The first 3 apartment complexes have 300 apartments each.
So, the total number of apartments in the first 3 complexes is 3 * 300 = 900 apartments.

The last apartment complex is 35% bigger than the other 3 combined.
First, we need to find the total number of apartments in the first 3 complexes, which is 900.
35% of 900 is 0.35 * 900 = 315.
So, the last complex has 900 + 315 = 1215 apartments.

Now, we need to find the total number of apartments in all 4 complexes.
The total number of apartments is 900 + 1215 = 2115 apartments.

Ali collects garbage 3 times a week from each place.
So, the total number of collections per week is 3 * 4 = 12 collections.

He gets paid €0.4 per collection for each apartment.
So, the total amount he gets paid per collection is 0.4 * 2115 = €843.

Since he collects garbage 3 times a week, the total amount he makes in a week is 3 * €843 = €2529.

Q: Ali collects garbage from 4 different apartment complexes. The first 3 have 300 apartments each and the last one is 35% bigger than the other 3 combined. Ali collects garbage 3 times a week from each place and he gets paid €0.4 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first 3 complexes:
There are 3 complexes with 300 apartments each.
So, the total number of apartments in the first 3 complexes is 3 * 300 = 900.

Next, let's calculate the total number of apartments in all 4 complexes:
The last complex is 35% bigger than the other 3 combined.
So, the number of apartments in the last complex is 900 + (35/100) * 900 = 900 + 315 = 1215.
The total number of apartments in all 4 complexes is 900 + 1215 = 2115.

Now, let's calculate how much Ali makes in a week:
Ali collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment.
He gets paid €0.4 per collection for each apartment.
So, the total amount he makes from each apartment in a week is 3 * €0.4 = €1.2.
The total amount he makes from all apartments in a week is 2115 * €1.2 = €2534.

Weight of the last trout = 28 kg
Total weight = 43 + 45 + 28 = 116 kg

Step 2: Calculate the total earnings

A: Let's think step by step.
Gabriel caught 5 trouts.
The total weight of the trouts is 43 + 45 + 28 = 116 kilograms.
Since each kilogram of trout costs ¥0.5, the total amount Gabriel will earn is 116 * ¥0.5 = ¥58.00.

If they work 11 hours each day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?",50.0,"To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning rooms, we need to first find the total number of minutes they spend cleaning rooms per day.

There are 110 rooms, and it takes them 15 minutes per room. So, the total number of minutes spent cleaning rooms per day is:

110 rooms x 15 minutes/room = 1650 minutes

They work 11 hours per day, which is equivalent to:

11 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 660 minutes

Now, we can find the percentage of their day spent cleaning rooms by dividing the total number of minutes spent cleaning rooms per day by the total number of minutes they work per day, and multiplying by 100:

(1650 minutes / 660 minutes) x 100% ≈ 249.24%

So, on average, they spend approximately 249.24% of their day cleaning rooms. However, this is not possible, as they can't spend more than 100% of their day cleaning rooms.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. The cleaner has 5 days to clean 110 rooms, and it takes them 15 minutes per room. The total number of minutes they spend cleaning rooms is:

110 rooms x 15 minutes/room = 1650 minutes

They work 11 hours per day, which is equivalent to 660 minutes per day. To find the total number of minutes they work in 5 days, we multiply the number of minutes they work per day by the number of days:

660 minutes/day x 5 days = 3300 minutes

Now, we can find the percentage of their day spent cleaning rooms by dividing the total number of minutes spent cleaning rooms by the total number of minutes they work in 5 days, and multiplying by 100:

(1650 minutes / 3300 minutes) x 100% ≈ 50%

So, on average, they spend approximately 50% of their 5-day work period cleaning rooms.",5.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

The cleaner has to clean 110 rooms.
It takes them 15 minutes per room. So, the total time to clean all the rooms is 110 * 15 minutes = 1650 minutes.
We need to convert this to hours since their workday is in hours. 
1 hour = 60 minutes. So, the total time in hours is 1650 minutes / 60 = 27.5 hours.
They have 5 days to complete the task, and they work 11 hours each day.
The total hours available to work is 5 * 11 hours = 55 hours.
To find the percentage of their day spent on cleaning, we divide the total hours spent on cleaning by the total available hours and multiply by 100.
First, we find the fraction of their workday spent on cleaning: 27.5 / 55 = 0.5
Then, we convert this fraction to a percentage by multiplying by 100: 0.5 * 100 = 50%
