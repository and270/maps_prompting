gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct,"Sophia went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, and 60 mini cheesecakes. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of donuts**

Sophia bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen. Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, we can calculate the number of dozens of donuts she bought:

60 donuts ÷ 12 donuts/dozen = 5 dozen donuts

The cost of 5 dozen donuts is:

5 dozen donuts × $19/dozen = $95

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of mini cupcakes**

Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen. Since there are 12 cupcakes in a dozen, we can calculate the number of dozens of cupcakes she bought:

60 cupcakes ÷ 12 cupcakes/dozen = 5 dozen cupcakes

The cost of 5 dozen cupcakes is:

5 dozen cupcakes × $33/dozen = $165

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of donuts and cupcakes**

The total cost of donuts and cupcakes is:

$95 (donuts) + $165 (cupcakes) = $260

**Step 4: Calculate the cost of mini cheesecakes**

After a 20% discount, Sophia paid a total of $1500. Let's call the total cost before the discount ""x"". We can set up an equation:

x - 20% of x = $1500

To solve for x, we can first calculate 20% of x:

20% of x = 0.20x

Now, we can rewrite the equation:

x - 0.20x = $1500

Combine like terms:

0.80x = $1500

Now, divide both sides by 0.80:

x = $1500 ÷ 0.80
x = $1875

So, the total cost before the discount is $1875.

**Step 5: Calculate the cost of mini cheesecakes**

The total cost before the discount is $1875. We already calculated the total cost of donuts and cupcakes, which is $260. We can subtract this amount from the total cost to find the cost of mini cheesecakes:

$1875 (total cost) - $260 (donuts and cupcakes) = $1615

Since Sophia bought 60 mini cheesecakes, we can calculate the cost per dozen:

$1615 ÷ 5 dozen cheesecakes = $323 per dozen cheesecakes

Therefore, the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is $323.",323.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes.

Sophia bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen. Since 60 is 5 dozen, the total cost of the donuts is 5 * $19 = $95.

She also bought 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen. Since 60 is 5 dozen, the total cost of the mini cupcakes is 5 * $33 = $165.

The total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes is $95 + $165 = $260.

Since Sophia paid a total of $1500 after a 20% discount, the original price before the discount was $1500 / (1 - 0.20) = $1500 / 0.80 = $1875.

The total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes is $260, so the cost of the mini cheesecakes is $1875 - $260 = $1615.

Since Sophia bought 60 mini cheesecakes, the cost per dozen is $1615 / 5 = $323.

The answer is $323.",323.0,1,,323.0,1

The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?",350.0,"To find out how many grams of popcorn each person can have, we need to calculate their remaining daily calorie target.

Hiroshi's calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight, so his total daily target is:
15 * 220 = 3300 calories

He has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise, so his remaining calorie target is:
3300 - 1100 - 200 = 1200 calories

Tara's calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight, so her total daily target is:
15 * 140 = 2100 calories

She has already consumed 900 calories and 200 calories in ice cream, so her remaining calorie target is:
2100 - 900 - 200 = 1000 calories

Since there are 6 servings in a 300g bag, each serving is:
300 / 6 = 50 grams

The number of grams each person still needs to consume is:
- Hiroshi: 1200 / 200 = 6 servings * 50g = 300 grams
- Tara: 1000 / 200 = 5 servings * 50g = 250 grams

The difference in grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara is:
300 - 250 = 50 grams

Hiroshi needs to consume 50 grams more popcorn than Tara.",50.0,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the daily calorie target for Hiroshi and Tara.

Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. So, Hiroshi's daily calorie target is 220 * 15 = 3300 calories.

Tara weighs 140 lbs. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. So, Tara's daily calorie target is 140 * 15 = 2100 calories.

Next, let's calculate how many calories Hiroshi and Tara have left to consume.

Hiroshi has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. So, he has 1100 - 200 = 900 calories left to consume.

Tara has already consumed 900 calories in food and 200 calories in ice cream. So, she has 900 + 200 = 1100 calories left to consume.

Since the daily calorie target for Hiroshi is 3300 calories, and he has 900 calories left to consume, he needs to consume 3300 - 900 = 2400 calories more.

Since the daily calorie target for Tara is 2100 calories, and she has 1100 calories left to consume, she needs to consume 2100 - 1100 = 1000 calories more.

Now, let's calculate how many servings of popcorn Hiroshi and Tara need to consume to reach their calorie targets.

Each serving of popcorn has 200 calories. Hiroshi needs to consume 2400 calories more, so he needs to consume 2400 / 200 = 12 servings of popcorn.

Tara needs to consume 1000 calories more, so she needs to consume 1000 / 200 = 5 servings of popcorn.

Since a 300 grams bag of popcorn has 6 servings, we can calculate how many grams of popcorn Hiroshi and Tara need to consume.

Hiroshi needs to consume 12 servings of popcorn, and each bag has 6 servings. So, he needs to consume 12 / 6 = 2 bags of popcorn.

Tara needs to consume 5 servings of popcorn, and each bag has 6 servings. So, she needs to consume 5 / 6 = 0.83 bags of popcorn (round down to 0 bags since you can't consume a fraction of a bag).

Finally, let's calculate how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara.

Hiroshi needs to consume 2 bags of popcorn, and each bag is 300 grams. So, he needs to consume 2 * 300 = 600 grams of popcorn.

Tara needs to consume 0 bags of popcorn, so she needs to consume 0 grams of popcorn.

The difference between the amount of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume and the amount Tara needs to consume is 600 - 0 = 600 grams.

The answer is 600.",600.0,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Hiroshi and Tara are trying to reach their daily calorie goals based on their body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs and his target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. 

Step 1: Calculate Hiroshi's daily calorie target.
Hiroshi's weight is 220 pounds.
His daily calorie target is 220 * 15 calories/pound = 3300 calories.

Hiroshi has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. 
Step 2: Calculate the remaining calories Hiroshi needs to consume.
Hiroshi has already consumed 1100 calories.
He has burned 200 calories through exercise.
So, the calories already accounted for is 1100 + 200 = 1300 calories.
The remaining calories needed is 3300 - 1300 = 2000 calories.

Tara weighs 140 lbs and her target is 15 calories per pound of body weight.
Step 3: Calculate Tara's daily calorie target.
Tara's weight is 140 pounds.
Her daily calorie target is 140 * 15 calories/pound = 2100 calories.

Tara has already consumed 900 calories in food and 200 calories in ice cream.
Step 4: Calculate the calories Tara has consumed in total.
Tara has consumed 900 calories in food and 200 calories in ice cream.
So, the total calories consumed by Tara is 900 + 200 = 1100 calories.

Step 5: Calculate the remaining calories Tara needs to consume.
Tara's daily calorie target is 2100 calories.
She has consumed 1100 calories.
So, the remaining calories needed for Tara is 2100 - 1100 = 1000 calories.

Step 6: Calculate how many servings of popcorn Hiroshi and Tara need to consume to reach their remaining calorie targets.
Each serving of popcorn has 200 calories.
Hiroshi needs 2000 calories.
So, the number of servings Hiroshi needs is 2000 / 200 = 10 servings.
Tara needs 1000 calories.
So, the number of servings Tara needs is 1000 / 200 = 5 servings.

Step 7: Calculate the number of grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume to get 10 servings.
Each serving of popcorn corresponds to a 300-gram bag.
So, the total number of grams Hiroshi needs is 10 * 300 = 3000 grams.

Step 8: Calculate the number of grams of popcorn Tara needs to consume to get 5 servings.
Each serving of popcorn corresponds to a 300-gram bag.
So, the total number of grams Tara needs is 5 * 300 = 1500 grams.

Step 9: Calculate the difference in the number of grams of popcorn Hiroshi and Tara need to consume.
Hiroshi needs 3000 grams of popcorn.
Tara needs 1500 grams of popcorn.
So, the difference is 3000 - 1500 = 1500 grams.

Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Daphne remain with?",335.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of potted plants Daphne already has**

Daphne has 56 window ledges, and each ledge has 8 potted plants. To find the total number of potted plants she already has, we multiply the number of ledges by the number of plants per ledge:

56 ledges × 8 plants/ledge = 448 plants

**Step 2: Calculate the number of new potted plants Daphne received**

Daphne received 23 new potted plants from the plant nursery two days ago.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of new potted plants Daphne purchased**

Daphne purchased 200 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount. To find the number of plants she actually purchased, we divide the original price by 2:

200 plants × 0.5 (50% discount) = 100 plants

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of potted plants Daphne has now**

We add the number of plants Daphne already had, the number of plants she received, and the number of plants she purchased:

448 plants (already had) + 23 plants (received) + 100 plants (purchased) = 571 plants

**Step 5: Calculate the number of potted plants Daphne will give away**

Daphne will give 6 potted plants from each of the 56 window ledges to friends and family tomorrow. To find the total number of plants she will give away, we multiply the number of ledges by the number of plants per ledge:

56 ledges × 6 plants/ledge = 336 plants

**Step 6: Calculate the number of potted plants Daphne will remain with**

We subtract the number of plants Daphne will give away from the total number of plants she has now:

571 plants (total) - 336 plants (given away) = 235 plants

Daphne starts with 56 window ledges, and each ledge has 8 potted plants.
So, the total number of potted plants she already has is 56 * 8 = 448.

So, the total number of potted plants now is 448 + 23 = 471.

Yesterday, she bought 200 new plants at a 50% discount. To calculate 50% of 200, we multiply 200 by 0.5.
0.5 * 200 = 100.

She bought the plants at a 50% discount, but that discount has already been calculated as 0.5 so she was actually charged 200 - 100 = 100 for the 200 plants.

If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which the fog bank is moving. We know that it takes 60 minutes to cover 4 miles, so we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate = Distance / Time
= 4 miles / 60 minutes
= 1/15 miles per minute

Since the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour, we need to calculate the new rate. Since the wind speed is halved, the rate will be reduced by half as well.

New rate = (1/15) / 2
= 1/30 miles per minute

However, we need to consider that the wind speed is halved in one hour, which is 60 minutes. So, the new rate will be effective after 60 minutes. To find the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, we need to calculate the distance covered in 60 minutes at the original rate, and then add the time it takes to cover the remaining distance at the new rate.

Distance covered in 60 minutes at the original rate:
= Rate x Time
= (1/15) x 60
= 4 miles

Since the city is 80 miles across, 1/4 of the city is:
= 80 / 4
= 20 miles

The fog bank has already covered 4 miles, so the remaining distance is:
= 20 - 4
= 16 miles

Time taken to cover the remaining distance at the new rate:
= Distance / New rate
= 16 / (1/30)
= 16 x 30
= 480 minutes

However, we need to add the 60 minutes it took for the wind speed to be halved. So, the total time taken to cover 1/4 of the city is:

Therefore, it will take 540 minutes for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city.",4.0,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

The city is 80 miles across, and the fog bank covers 4 miles every 60 minutes. To find out how many minutes it takes to cover the entire city, we need to divide the total distance by the rate at which the fog bank moves.

So, the time it takes to cover the entire city is 80 miles / 4 miles per 60 minutes = 80 / 4 = 20 times 60 minutes.

However, we want to find out how long it takes to cover 1/4 of the city. Since the city is 80 miles across, 1/4 of the city is 80 / 4 = 20 miles.

Since the fog bank covers 4 miles every 60 minutes, we need to find out how long it takes to cover 20 miles. We can do this by dividing 20 miles by 4 miles per 60 minutes.

20 miles / 4 miles per 60 minutes = 5 times 60 minutes.

So, it will take 5 times 60 minutes, or 300 minutes, to cover 1/4 of the city.

However, we are told that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. This means that the fog bank will cover 2 miles every 60 minutes instead of 4 miles.

To find out how long it takes to cover 20 miles at this new rate, we can divide 20 miles by 2 miles per 60 minutes.

20 miles / 2 miles per 60 minutes = 10 times 60 minutes.

So, it will take 10 times 60 minutes, or 600 minutes, to cover 1/4 of the city at the new rate.

Let's think step by step.

The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes.
However, the wind speed is halved in one hour, so the new speed is 4 / 2 = 2 miles per 60 minutes.

The city is 80 miles across, and we want to find the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city.
1/4 of the city is 80 / 4 = 20 miles.

Since the fog bank now covers 2 miles in 60 minutes, we need to find the time it takes to cover 20 miles.
To do this, we can set up a proportion: 2 miles / 60 minutes = 20 miles / x minutes.
We can then solve for x by cross-multiplying: 2x = 20 * 60.

On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 2-hour episodes. On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?",6.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, Santiago watched 4-hour episodes each night, so he watched 2 x 4 = 8 hours of TV on those two nights.

On Friday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. We need to convert the 45-minute show to hours: 45 minutes = 0.75 hours. So, he watched 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours of TV on Friday.

On Saturday, he watched three 2-hour episodes, so he watched 3 x 2 = 6 hours of TV on Saturday.

On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes. We need to convert the 15 minutes to hours: 15 minutes = 0.25 hours. So, he watched 3 x 0.25 = 0.75 hours of TV on Sunday.

Now, let's add up the total hours of TV Santiago watched:

8 hours (Tuesday and Wednesday) + 3.75 hours (Friday) + 6 hours (Saturday) + 0.75 hours (Sunday) = 18.5 hours

However, we know that Santiago watched a total of 20 hours of TV. This means that the remaining 20 - 18.5 = 1.5 hours of TV must have been watched on Thursday.

On Thursday, Santiago watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. We need to find out how many episodes he watched. Let's call the number of episodes x. Since each episode is 15 minutes, the total time watched on Thursday is 0.25x hours.

We know that the total time watched on Thursday is 1.5 hours, so we can set up the equation:

0.25x = 1.5

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.25:

x = 1.5 / 0.25
x = 6

So, Santiago watched 6 episodes of the 15-minute show on Thursday.",15.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's break down the total time Santiago watched TV into the time he watched each day.

- Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 nights * 4 hours/night = 8 hours
- Thursday: We don't know how many episodes of the 15-minute show he watched, so let's leave it as 'x' episodes. Each episode is 15 minutes, or 0.25 hours. So the time he watched TV on Thursday is 0.25x hours.
- Friday: He watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. Convert the 45-minute show to hours by dividing by 60: 45 / 60 = 0.75 hours. The total time he watched on Friday is 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.
- Saturday: He watched three 2-hour episodes, for a total of 3 * 2 = 6 hours.
- Sunday: He watched three 15-minute episodes. Convert the 15 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 15 / 60 = 0.25 hours. He watched 3 * 0.25 = 0.75 hours of TV on Sunday.

Now, let's add up the time he watched each day to get the total time he watched TV:
8 hours + 0.25x hours + 3.75 hours + 6 hours + 0.75 hours = 18.75 + 0.25x hours.

We are given that he watched a total of 20 hours of TV. So we can set up the equation:
18.75 + 0.25x = 20

Now, let's solve the equation for x:
0.25x = 20 - 18.75
0.25x = 1.25

If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?

Let's think step by step.

Santiago watched 4-hour episodes on Tuesday and Wednesday, which is 2 * 4 = 8 hours.
He watched a 3-hour episode on Friday, which is 1 * 3 = 3 hours.
He watched three 2-hour episodes on Saturday, which is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.
He watched three 15-minute episodes on Sunday, which is 3 * 0.25 = 0.75 hours.
So, the total number of hours he watched is 8 + 3 + 6 + 0.75 = 17.75 hours.

However, we know that he watched 20 hours of TV in all.
So, the number of hours he watched on Thursday is 20 - 17.75 = 2.25 hours.

Since each episode of the 15-minute show is 0.25 hours, we can find the number of episodes he watched on Thursday by dividing the total hours he watched on Thursday by the length of each episode: 2.25 / 0.25 = 9.

She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, and uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

Step 1: Determine the ratio of sugar to water
The ratio of sugar to water is given as 54:27. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 27. This gives us a simplified ratio of 2:1.

Step 2: Determine the amount of water used
Since the ratio of sugar to water is 2:1, for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, 1 cup of water is used. Let's say the number of teaspoons of sugar used is x. Then, the number of cups of water used is x/2.

Step 3: Determine the amount of milk used
Nia uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water. Since the number of cups of water used is x/2, the number of tablespoons of milk used is 8(x/2)/8 = x/2.

Step 4: Determine the amount of heavy cream used
Nia uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. Since the number of teaspoons of sugar used is x, the number of tablespoons of heavy cream used is 2x.

Step 5: Set up an equation to represent the total amount of ingredients used
The total amount of ingredients used is 240. This includes the teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 2x = 240

Combine like terms:

4.5x = 240

Step 6: Solve for x
Divide both sides of the equation by 4.5:

x = 240/4.5
x = 53.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a teaspoon of sugar, we can round x to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the exact amount of sugar used, so we will leave the answer as a decimal.

First, let's analyze the given ratio of sugar to water, which is 54:27. This means that for every 54 teaspoons of sugar, Nia uses 27 cups of water.

Next, let's consider the relationship between the amount of milk and water. Nia uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water. This means that the amount of milk is equal to the amount of water.

Now, let's consider the relationship between the amount of heavy cream and sugar. Nia uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar.

We are given that Nia used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as S, the number of cups of water as W, the number of tablespoons of cream as C, and the number of tablespoons of milk as M.

We know that S + W + C + M = 240.

We also know that S = 54x and W = 27x, where x is a constant.

We know that M = 8W and C = 2S.

Substituting the expressions for W and M in terms of x into the equation S + W + C + M = 240, we get:

S + 27x + 2S + 8(27x) = 240

Combine like terms:

3S + 27x + 216x = 240

Combine like terms:

3S + 243x = 240

Now, substitute S = 54x:

3(54x) + 243x = 240

Combine like terms:

162x + 243x = 240

Combine like terms:

405x = 240

Divide both sides by 405:

x = 240/405

x = 8/135

Now that we have found x, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar used:

S = 54x
= 54(8/135)
= 48/15
= 3.2

However, we are given that Nia used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. This means that the total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk must be a multiple of the ratio 54:27.

Let's try to find the smallest multiple of 54:27 that is greater than or equal to 240.

The smallest multiple of 54:27 that is greater than or equal to 240 is 540:270.

This means that Nia used 540 teaspoons of sugar and 270 cups of water.

Since the ratio of sugar to water is 54:27, we can set up the following proportion:

540/54 = 270/W

Cross-multiply:

540W = 54(270)

Divide both sides by 540:

W = 54(270)/540

W = 270/5

W = 54

Now that we have found W, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar used:

S = 54x
= 54(54/27)
= 54(2)
= 108

The answer is 108.",108.0,0,"Let's start by analyzing the given problem again.

Question: Nia makes tea using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 54:27. She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, and uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Let's think step by step.

We know the ratio of sugar to water is 54:27, which means for every 54 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 27 cups of water.

Let's assume the number of teaspoons of sugar used is x.

Since she uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, the number of tablespoons of milk used is 27/8 times the number of tablespoons of cream used.

The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk used is 240.

We can set up the equation: x + 27 + 2x/54 + 27/8 * 2x/54 = 240.

Simplifying the equation:
x + 27 + 1/27x + 1/4 * 1/27x = 240

Combine like terms:
x + 1/27x + 1/108x = 240 - 27
(108x + x + 1/27x) = 213
(108x + x) + 1/27x = 213
109x + 1/27x = 213

Multiply the entire equation by 27 to eliminate the fraction:
(109x * 27) + 1x = 213 * 27
2937x + x = 5739

Combine like terms:
2937x + x = 5739
2938x = 5739

Now, divide both sides by 2938:
x = 5739 / 2938
x = 1.95

However, since this is an incorrect answer, let's re-evaluate the problem and our solution.

After re-evaluating the problem, we need to simplify the equation:
Since the total number of tablespoons of milk used is 27/8 times the number of tablespoons of cream used, and she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar, the total number of tablespoons of milk used is 27/8 * 2x.

The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk used is 240.

We can set up the equation: x + 27 + 2x + 27/8 * 2x = 240.

Simplifying the equation:
x + 27 + 2x + 27/4 * x = 240

Combine like terms:
3x + 27 + 6.75x = 240

Combine like terms:
9.75x + 27 = 240

Subtract 27 from both sides:
9.75x = 213

Now, divide both sides by 9.75:
x = 213 / 9.75
x = 21.77

However, this answer is still incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's assume the number of teaspoons of sugar used is x.

Since the ratio of sugar to water is 54:27, the number of cups of water used is 27, which is equal to 27/54 * x.

Since she uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, the number of tablespoons of milk used is 27/8 * (27/54) * x.

Since she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar, the number of tablespoons of heavy cream used is 2x.

The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk used is 240.

We can set up the equation: x + 27/54 * x + 27/8 * 27/54 * x + 2x = 240.

Simplifying the equation:
x + (1/2)x + (27/8)(1/2)x + 2x = 240

Combine like terms:
(8/8)x + (4/8)x + (27/8)(4/8)x + (16/8)x = 240

Combine like terms:
(32/8)x + (108/8)x = 240

Combine like terms:
(140/8)x = 240

Multiply both sides by 8/140:
x = 240 * (8/140)

x = 240 * (4/70)

x = 240 * (2/35)

x = 480/35

x = 13.71

However, this answer is still incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

After re-evaluating the problem, we need to simplify the equation:
Since the ratio of sugar to water is 54:27, the number of cups of water used is 27, which is equal to 27/54 * x.

Since she uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, the number of tablespoons of milk used is 27/8 * 27/54 * x.

Since she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar, the number of tablespoons of heavy cream used is 2x.

We can set up the equation: x + 27/54 * x + 27/8 * 27/54 * x + 2x = 240.

Simplifying the equation:
x + (1/2)x + (27/8)(1/2)x + 2x = 240

Combine like terms:
(8/8)x + (4/8)x + (27/8)(4/8)x + (16/8)x = 240

Combine like terms:
(32/8)x + (108/8)x = 240

Combine like terms:
(140/8)x = 240

Multiply both sides by 8/140:
x = 240 * (8/140)

x = 240 * (4/70)

x = 240 * (2/35)

x = 480/35

x = 13.71

However, since we're told that the ratio of sugar to water is 54:27, let's re-evaluate this ratio.

The ratio 54:27 can be simplified to 18:9. Since 18 and 9 have a common factor of 9, we can further simplify the ratio to 2:1.

So, the ratio of sugar to water is 2:1. This means for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, 1 cup of water is used.

Since she uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, the number of tablespoons of milk used is 8/8 = 1 times the number of tablespoons of cream used.

Since she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar, the number of tablespoons of heavy cream used is equal to the number of teaspoons of sugar used.

Let's assume the number of teaspoons of sugar used is x.

The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk used is 240.

We can set up the equation: x + 1/2x + x + x = 240.

Combine like terms:
3.5x = 240

Now, divide both sides by 3.5:
x = 240 / 3.5
x = 68.57

However, since we're told that she used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk, let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's assume the number of cups of water used is y.

Since the ratio of sugar to water is 2:1, the number of teaspoons of sugar used is 2y.

Since she uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, the number of tablespoons of milk used is y.

Since she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar, the number of tablespoons of heavy cream used is 2y.

The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk used is 240.

We can set up the equation: 2y + y + 2y + y = 240.

Combine like terms:
6y = 240

Now, divide both sides by 6:
y = 240 / 6
y = 40

Since the number of teaspoons of sugar used is 2y, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar used by multiplying 2 and 40:

2 * 40 = 80.

The answer is 80.",80.0,0
gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct,"Aisha was preparing for a lunch party at her house, where she intended to serve stuffed peppers. She noticed that she was out of plastic forks, so she bought a new package of forks. Later, her husband also bought a package of 8 new forks and gave them to Aisha. While Aisha was making the stuffed peppers, she used sixteen of the forks to sample her stuffed peppers, then threw away 6 defective forks. The guests also brought 2 packs of forks, each having 6 inside them. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 32 forks. How many forks were in the package that Aisha bought?",34.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Aisha's husband bought a package of 8 new forks and gave them to Aisha.
2. Aisha used 16 forks to sample her stuffed peppers.
3. Aisha threw away 6 defective forks.
4. The guests brought 2 packs of forks, each having 6 inside them, so they brought a total of 2 x 6 = 12 forks.
5. Aisha had a total of 32 forks when she went to set the table.

Now, let's add up the forks that Aisha had at the end:

32 (total forks) = 8 (Aisha's husband's forks) + 16 (forks used by Aisha) + 12 (forks brought by guests) + x (forks in the package Aisha bought)

We can simplify the equation:

32 = 8 + 16 + 12 + x
32 = 36 + x

Now, let's solve for x:

x = 32 - 36
x = -4

However, we can't have a negative number of forks, so let's re-examine the problem. We know that Aisha had a total of 32 forks, and we can subtract the forks that Aisha's husband brought, the forks used by Aisha, and the forks brought by guests:

Aisha starts with an unknown number of forks from the package she bought.
Her husband gives her 8 more forks.
She uses 16 forks to sample the stuffed peppers.
She throws away 6 defective forks.
The guests bring 2 packs of forks, each with 6 forks inside, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 forks.
So, the total number of forks is 32.
We know that she had 8 forks from her husband, 12 forks from the guests, and 16 forks she used, so that's 8 + 12 + 16 = 36 forks.
Since she started with an unknown number of forks, let's call that number x.
So, the total number of forks is x + 8 + 12 + 16 = 32.

Let's try to find the number of forks Aisha bought by subtracting the number of forks she got from her husband and the guests from the total number of forks.

Aisha has a total of 32 forks.
She got 8 forks from her husband and 12 forks from the guests.
So, the total number of forks she got from her husband and the guests is 8 + 12 = 20 forks.
To find the number of forks Aisha bought, we need to subtract the number of forks she got from her husband and the guests from the total number of forks.
32 - 20 = 12.

She noticed that she was out of plastic forks, so she bought a new package of forks. Later, her husband also bought a package of 8 new forks and gave them to Aisha. While Aisha was making the stuffed peppers, she used sixteen of the forks to sample her stuffed peppers, then threw away 6 defective forks. The guests also brought 2 packs of forks, each having 6 inside them. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 32 forks. How many forks were in the package that Aisha bought?

A: Let's think step by step.

Aisha starts with an unknown number of forks in the package she bought.

Her husband gives her a package of 8 new forks.

She uses 16 forks to sample her stuffed peppers.

She throws away 6 defective forks.

The guests bring 2 packs of forks, each with 6 forks inside.

Later, she has a total of 32 forks.

Let's assume the number of forks in the package Aisha bought is x.

The total number of forks is the sum of the forks in the package Aisha bought, the forks her husband gave her, the forks she used, the forks she threw away, and the forks the guests brought.

We can set up the equation: x + 8 - 16 - 6 + 2 * 6 = 32.

Combine like terms:
x + 8 - 16 - 6 + 12 = 32

Combine like terms:
x - 2 = 32

Add 2 to both sides:
x = 34

In addition, Ravi owns a 13-square yard apricot field that produces 12 apricots per square yard. The apricots can be harvested every 4 months. In the span of two years, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?",1764.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bananas and apricots Ravi can harvest in 2 years.

1. Calculate the total number of bananas Ravi can harvest every 4 months:
   He has 10 square yards of banana field. 
   There are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard. 
   First, we need to find out how many bananas are in 1 square yard: 
   36 bananas / (4/5) = 36 * (5/4) = 45 bananas per square yard.
   So, the total number of bananas per 10 square yards is: 
   45 bananas/square yard * 10 square yards = 450 bananas.

   Since Ravi can harvest every 4 months, he harvests bananas 6 times in 2 years (2 years * 3 harvests/year = 6 harvests).

   Total bananas harvested in 2 years = 450 bananas/harvest * 6 harvests = 2700 bananas.

2. Calculate the total number of apricots Ravi can harvest every 4 months:
   He has 13 square yards of apricot field, and it produces 12 apricots per square yard.
   Total apricots per 13 square yards = 12 apricots/square yard * 13 square yards = 156 apricots.

   Since Ravi can harvest every 4 months, he harvests apricots 6 times in 2 years (2 years * 3 harvests/year = 6 harvests).

   Total apricots harvested in 2 years = 156 apricots/harvest * 6 harvests = 936 apricots.

3. Calculate the difference in the number of bananas and apricots harvested in 2 years:
   Difference = Total bananas - Total apricots
   Difference = 2700 - 936
   Difference = 1764

Ravi harvests 1764 more bananas than apricots in 2 years.",2.0,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field. He can harvest bananas every 4 months.

First, let's find out how many bananas Ravi can harvest from his banana field in one harvest period (4 months).

There are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard. Since Ravi has 10 square yards, we need to find out how many four-fifths of a square yard are in 10 square yards.

1 square yard is equal to 4/5 square yards (since 4/5 is the fraction given). So, 10 square yards is equal to 10 * (4/5) = 8 square yards of four-fifths.

Now, we can find out how many bananas Ravi can harvest from 8 square yards of four-fifths.

Number of bananas per 4/5 square yard = 36
Number of 4/5 square yards in 10 square yards = 8
Total number of bananas per harvest period = 36 * 8 = 288

Since Ravi can harvest bananas every 4 months, he can harvest bananas 6 times in 2 years (2 years * 3 harvest periods per year = 6 harvest periods).

Total number of bananas harvested in 2 years = 288 * 6 = 1728

Now, let's consider Ravi's apricot field. He has 13 square yards of apricot field, and he can harvest apricots every 4 months.

Number of apricots per square yard = 12
Number of square yards of apricot field = 13
Total number of apricots per harvest period = 12 * 13 = 156

Since Ravi can harvest apricots every 4 months, he can harvest apricots 6 times in 2 years (2 years * 3 harvest periods per year = 6 harvest periods).

Total number of apricots harvested in 2 years = 156 * 6 = 936

Now, let's find out how many more bananas Ravi harvests than apricots in 2 years.

Total number of bananas harvested in 2 years = 1728
Total number of apricots harvested in 2 years = 936
Difference in harvest = 1728 - 936 = 792

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Arjun bought:

1. Folders: 12 folders * $4.75 each = $57
2. Erasers: 8 erasers * $14.5 each = $116
3. Bond paper: 1 ream * $11 = $11
4. Pencils: 7 pencils * $8 each = $56

So, the total cost of the items is $57 + $116 + $11 + $56 = $240.

Now, let's consider the two options:

Option 1: Arjun becomes a member and gets a 20% discount on all purchases.

The total cost with the 20% discount is $240 - (20% of $240) = $240 - $48 = $192.

Option 2: Arjun does not become a member and gets a 5% discount on all purchases.

The total cost with the 5% discount is $240 - (5% of $240) = $240 - $12 = $228.

Since $192 is less than $228, the least amount Arjun can spend on everything is $192.

The answer is $192.",192.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Arjun bought 12 folders which cost $4.75 each.
So, the total cost of folders is 12 * $4.75 = $57.

Arjun bought 8 erasers which cost $14.5 each.
So, the total cost of erasers is 8 * $14.5 = $116.

Arjun bought a ream of bond paper which cost $11.

Arjun bought 7 pencils which cost $8 each.
So, the total cost of pencils is 7 * $8 = $56.

The total cost of all items is $57 + $116 + $11 + $56 = $240.

Arjun has two options to receive a discount:
Option 1: He becomes a member and gets a 20% discount.
Option 2: He doesn't become a member and gets a 5% discount.

Let's calculate the total cost with each option:
Option 1: He pays a $20 fee and gets a 20% discount on $240.
First, he pays the $20 fee.
Then, the discounted price is 20% of $240 = 0.2 * $240 = $48.
The price after the discount is $240 - $48 = $192.

Option 2: He doesn't pay the fee but gets a 5% discount on $240.
The discounted price is 5% of $240 = 0.05 * $240 = $12.
The price after the discount is $240 - $12 = $228.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row, than that he rolls four even numbers in a row?",50.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of each event and then find the difference in percentage points.

Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row
The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a 20-sided die is 10/20 = 1/2.
Since the die is rolled twice, we need to multiply the probability by itself:
(1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4

Event 2: Rolling four even numbers in a row
The probability of rolling an even number on a 20-sided die is 10/20 = 1/2.
Since the die is rolled four times, we need to multiply the probability by itself four times:
(1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/16

Now, we need to find the difference in percentage points between the two probabilities:
(1/4 - 1/16) = (4/16 - 1/16) = 3/16

To convert this to a percentage, we can multiply by 100:
(3/16) × 100 = 18.75%

So, Yusuf is 18.75% more likely to roll a number greater than 5 twice in a row than to roll four even numbers in a row.",5.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row, we first need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a single roll. 

A twenty-sided die has numbers 1 through 20, and half of those are greater than 5 (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20). So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a single roll is 15/20 or 3/4.

Since the events are independent, the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

However, the question asks for the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row. There are 10 even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20) on a 20-sided die. 

So, the probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 10/20 or 1/2. Since the events are independent, the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16.

Now, to find the difference in percentage points, we first need to find the difference in probability. 

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is 9/16, and the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is 1/16. 

So, the difference in probability is 9/16 - 1/16 = 8/16. To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 8. This gives us a difference of 1/2 or 0.5. 

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100. 0.5 * 100 = 50.

The difference in percentage points is 50.

Mia then found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. In addition, she saw 24 wasps, and 9 bees. What percentage of animals in the plot were rabbits?",20.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mia found 2/3 as many beetles as bees. Let's say the number of bees is x. Then, the number of beetles is 2/3x.

2. Mia found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. This means the number of rabbits is 26/2 = 13.

3. In addition, she saw 24 wasps and 9 bees. So, the total number of bees and wasps is 24 + 9 = 33.

4. Since the number of beetles is 2/3x, and the number of bees is x, we can set up an equation to find the total number of insects (bees and beetles):

2/3x + x = 33

Combine like terms:

5/3x = 33

Multiply both sides by 3/5:

x = 33 * 3/5
x = 19.8

So, the number of bees is approximately 19.8, and the number of beetles is 2/3 * 19.8 = 13.2.

5. Now, let's find the total number of animals in the plot. We know the number of rabbits (13), the number of bees and wasps (33), and the number of beetles (13.2). We can add these numbers together to get the total number of animals:

13 + 33 + 13.2 = 59.2

6. Finally, let's find the percentage of animals that are rabbits. We can divide the number of rabbits by the total number of animals and multiply by 100:

(13 / 59.2) * 100 ≈ 21.9%

So, approximately 21.9% of the animals in the plot were rabbits.",21.9,0,"Let's think step by step to find the percentage of animals that were rabbits.

To find the total number of animals, we need to calculate the total number of beetles and bees first.
Mia found 2/3 as many beetles as bees. Since she saw 9 bees, we can calculate the number of beetles as follows:
Mia found 2/3 * 9 = 6 beetles.

Now, we know she saw 26 white animals, of which half were rabbits. So, the number of rabbits is 26 / 2 = 13. And the number of non-rabbits (which are white animals that aren't rabbits) is 26 - 13 = 13.

In addition, she saw 24 wasps. We've already calculated the number of bees as 9. So, the total number of bees and wasps is 9 + 24 = 33. And the total number of beetles is 6.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals in the plot:
The number of rabbits is 13.
The number of bees and wasps is 33.
The number of beetles is 6.
The number of non-rabbits (white animals) is 13.
Combining the beetles with the non-rabbits, we get 13 + 6 = 19.

Now, let's find the total number of animals in the plot by adding all the animals together:
Total animals = 13 (rabbits) + 33 (bees and wasps) + 19 (beetles and non-rabbits) = 13 + 33 + 19 = 65.

The question asks for the percentage of animals that were rabbits, so we need to find the fraction of rabbits in the total number of animals and then convert it to a percentage:
Fraction of rabbits = Number of rabbits / Total number of animals = 13 / 65.

To convert the fraction to a percentage, multiply the fraction by 100:
Percentage of rabbits = (13 / 65) * 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20%.

If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?",11000.0,"To find out how much more the total cost will be than Mrs. Lee's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the property with the discount and the additional fees.

1. Calculate the discount on the selling price:
   Selling price = $400,000
   Discount = 25% of $400,000
   Discount = 0.25 * $400,000 = $100,000

   So, the price after the discount = Selling price - Discount
   Price after discount = $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000

2. Calculate the brokerage fee:
   Brokerage fee = 5% of the selling price
   Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

3. Calculate the transfer fee:
   Transfer fee = 12% of the selling price
   Transfer fee = 0.12 * $400,000 = $48,000

4. Calculate the total cost:
   Total cost = Price after discount + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
   Total cost = $300,000 + $20,000 + $48,000

So, the total cost will be $28,000 more than Mrs. Lee's budget.",28000.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Mrs. Lee's budget is $340,000.

The selling price of the property is $400,000, but she can get a 25% discount on that price.

So, the discount amount is 25% of $400,000.
To find 25% of $400,000, we multiply $400,000 by 0.25.
$400,000 * 0.25 = $100,000.

The discounted price is the original selling price minus the discount amount.
$400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000.

On top of this price, Mrs. Lee has to pay a brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.
To find 5% of $400,000, we multiply $400,000 by 0.05.
$400,000 * 0.05 = $20,000.

She also has to pay a transfer fee, which is 12% of the selling price of $400,000.
To find 12% of $400,000, we multiply $400,000 by 0.12.
$400,000 * 0.12 = $48,000.

The total cost of the property is the discounted price plus the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.
$300,000 + $20,000 + $48,000 = $368,000.

Mrs. Lee is looking for a new townhouse within her budget of $340,000.

The property she is looking at has a selling price of $400,000. However, she can get a 25% discount on this price.

So, let's calculate the discounted price.
The discount on the selling price is 25% of 400,000, which is 0.25 * 400,000 = 100,000.
The discounted price is 400,000 - 100,000 = 300,000.

On top of the discounted selling price, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the discounted selling price. 
The brokerage fee is 0.05 * 300,000 = 15,000.

Additionally, the transfer fee is 12% of the discounted selling price.
The transfer fee is 0.12 * 300,000 = 36,000.

The total cost to Mrs. Lee will be the sum of the discounted selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee.
So, the total cost is 300,000 + 15,000 + 36,000 = 351,000.

She also bought a mixed bag of sand dollars for ₺11.0 and 12 postcards that were ₺21.0 each. Priya then donated ₺5 at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Priya have left?",492.0,"Let's break down the expenses step by step:

1. The cost of the fudge:
First, Priya bought 15 kgs of fudge at ₺22 per kg, so the cost of the 15 kgs is 15 * ₺22 = ₺330.
Next, she got 4 kgs at 1/4 off. The original price would be 4 * ₺22 = ₺88. But 1/4 off is the same as 3/4 of the price, so she got 4 kgs for 3/4 * ₺88 = ₺66. Therefore, the cost of the 4 kgs is ₺66.
So, the total cost of the fudge is ₺330 + ₺66 = ₺396.

2. Cost of the sand dollars:
Priya bought a mixed bag of sand dollars for ₺11.

3. Cost of the postcards:
She bought 12 postcards at ₺21 each, so the total cost of the postcards is 12 * ₺21 = ₺252.

4. Donation:
Priya donated ₺5 to the charity.

Now, we need to find the total cost of all the items:
Total cost = Cost of fudge + Cost of sand dollars + Cost of postcards - Donation
Total cost = ₺396 + ₺11 + ₺252 - ₺5
Total cost = ₺654

Priya started with ₺1200. After making the purchases, she has:
Priya's remaining money = Initial money - Total cost

Priya's remaining money = ₺546

So, Priya has ₺546 left.",546.0,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Priya starts with ₺1200.

She buys 15 kgs of fudge at ₺22 per kg, which costs 15 * ₺22 = ₺330.

She also gets 4 kgs at 1/4 off, which is 4 * ₺22 * 1/4 = ₺22. This is a discount, so we subtract it from the original price of 4 kgs, which is ₺88. So, the cost of the discounted 4 kgs is ₺88 - ₺22 = ₺66.

The total cost of the fudge is ₺330 + ₺66 = ₺396.

She also buys a mixed bag of sand dollars for ₺11.0 and 12 postcards for ₺21.0 each. The total cost of the postcards is 12 * ₺21.0 = ₺252.

The total cost of all the items is ₺396 + ₺11.0 + ₺252 = ₺659.

Priya also donates ₺5 at a charity stand.

So, the total amount spent is ₺659 + ₺5 = ₺664.

* Puppies with spots: 13
* Puppies without spots: 47 - 13 = 34
* No change in the number of puppies with spots

**Yuki's dogs:**

* Total puppies: 54 x 13 = 702 (since each of Yuki's 54 dogs has 13 puppies with spots)

First, let's calculate the total number of puppies with spots from Jamal and Gabriel. 
Jamal's dog has 23 puppies with spots.
Gabriel's dog has 13 puppies with spots.
So, the total number of puppies with spots from Jamal and Gabriel is 23 + 13 = 36.

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies that Yuki has with spots.
Yuki has 54 dogs, each having 13 puppies with spots.
So, the total number of puppies with spots from Yuki is 54 * 13 = 702.

Now, let's find the total number of puppies from Jamal, Gabriel, and Yuki.
Jamal's dog has 131 puppies.
Gabriel's dog has 47 puppies.
Yuki has 54 * 13 = 702 puppies. But Yuki's 54 is the number of dogs so we need the total number of puppies which is 54 * 13 = 702 * 54 = 37608.
  So, the total number of puppies from Yuki is 37608. 
However, this is the total number of puppies and not the total number of puppies with spots from Yuki. We have already added the total number of puppies with spots from Yuki above which is 702. 
However, we also need to add the puppies from Yuki that have spots that were not visible before. We are told that half of his unspotted puppies actually have spots that were not visible before. So, the number of puppies with spots that were not visible before is half of the total number of unspotted puppies which is 37608 - 702 = 36906 / 2 = 18453.

Now, let's add the puppies with spots from Yuki that were visible before and the puppies that were not visible before.
So, the number of puppies with spots from Yuki is 702 + 18453 = 18755.

Now, let's find the total number of puppies from Jamal, Gabriel, and Yuki.
The total number of puppies from Jamal, Gabriel, and Yuki is 131 + 47 + 37608 = 37786.

We already found the total number of puppies from Jamal, Gabriel, and Yuki which is 37786. And the total number of puppies with spots from Yuki is 18755.
However, we also need to add the puppies with spots from Jamal and Gabriel which we already calculated which is 36.
So, the total number of puppies with spots is 36 + 18755 = 18771.

Now, let's find the percentage of puppies with spots.
The total number of puppies with spots is 18771.
The total number of puppies is 37786.

Jamal's dog has 23 puppies with spots.
Gabriel's dog has 13 puppies with spots.
Yuki's dogs have 702 puppies with spots.

The farmer buys a variety of items, including apples, cucumbers, hay, corn, groceries, tools, and wood.

1. First, we need to calculate the total weight of each item.
- The apples are 4 boxes of 3-kg, so the total weight of apples is 4 * 3 = 12 kg.
- The cucumbers are 12 bags of 6-kg, so the total weight of cucumbers is 12 * 6 = 72 kg.
- The hay are 34 packs of 39-kg, so the total weight of hay is 34 * 39 = 1326 kg.
- The corn are 20 sacks of 17-kg, so the total weight of corn is 20 * 17 = 340 kg.
- The groceries weigh 43 kg.
- The tools weigh 27 kg.
- The wood weighs 100 kg.

On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?",45.0,"To find the percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras on each shark and divide it by the length of the shark.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Shark 1:**

1. Calculate the total length of the remoras on Shark 1:
   - Each remora is 16 inches long.
   - There are 18 remoras.
   - Total length of remoras = 18 * 16 = 288 inches

2. Convert the length of Shark 1 to inches:
   - Shark 1 is 40 feet long.
   - 1 foot = 12 inches, so 40 feet = 40 * 12 = 480 inches

3. Calculate the percentage of Shark 1's body length covered by the remoras:
   - Percentage = (Total length of remoras / Length of Shark 1) * 100
   - Percentage = (288 / 480) * 100
   - Percentage ≈ 60%

**Remoras on Shark 1 swim away:**

1. Calculate the number of remoras that swam away:
   - 1/6 of the remoras swam away.
   - Total remoras = 18
   - Remoras that swam away = 18 / 6 = 3

2. Calculate the new total length of the remoras on Shark 1:
   - New total length of remoras = 18 - 3 = 15 remoras
   - Each remora is 16 inches long.
   - New total length of remoras = 15 * 16 = 240 inches

3. Calculate the new percentage of Shark 1's body length covered by the remoras:
   - New percentage = (New total length of remoras / Length of Shark 1) * 100
   - New percentage = (240 / 480) * 100
   - New percentage ≈ 50%

**Shark 2:**

1. Calculate the total length of the remoras on Shark 2:
   - Each remora is 8 inches long.
   - There are 6 remoras.
   - Total length of remoras = 6 * 8 = 48 inches

2. Convert the length of Shark 2 to inches:
   - Shark 2 is 10 feet long.
   - 1 foot = 12 inches, so 10 feet = 10 * 12 = 120 inches

3. Calculate the percentage of Shark 2's body length covered by the remoras:
   - Percentage = (Total length of remoras / Length of Shark 2) * 100
   - Percentage = (48 / 120) * 100
   - Percentage ≈ 40%

Therefore, the percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras is approximately 60% for Shark 1, 50% for Shark 1 after some remoras swam away, and 40% for Shark 2.",2.0,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the 40-foot shark.

Each remora is 16 inches long, and there are 18 remoras.
So, the total length of the remoras is 18 * 16 = 288 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the total length of the remoras to feet:
288 inches / 12 = 24 feet

Now, let's calculate the percentage of the 40-foot shark's body length covered by the remoras:
(24 feet / 40 feet) * 100% = 60%

Next, let's calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the 10-foot shark.

Each remora is 8 inches long, and there are 6 remoras.
So, the total length of the remoras is 6 * 8 = 48 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the total length of the remoras to feet:
48 inches / 12 = 4 feet

Now, let's calculate the percentage of the 10-foot shark's body length covered by the remoras:
(4 feet / 10 feet) * 100% = 40%

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's find the total length of the remoras attached to the 40-foot shark.
There are 18 remoras, each 16 inches long.
So, the total length of the remoras is 18 * 16 = 288 inches.
We need to convert this to feet: 288 inches / 12 = 24 feet.

Next, let's find the length of the remoras that swam away.
1/6 of the remoras swam away, which is 1/6 * 18 = 3 remoras.
The total length of the remoras that swam away is 3 * 16 = 48 inches.
We need to convert this to feet: 48 inches / 12 = 4 feet.

Now, let's find the total length of the remoras attached to the 40-foot shark after some swam away.
The total length of remoras after some swam away is 24 - 4 = 20 feet.

The total length of the 40-foot shark and the remoras is 40 + 20 = 60 feet.

Next, let's find the total length of the remoras attached to the 10-foot shark.
There are 6 remoras, each 8 inches long.
So, the total length of the remoras is 6 * 8 = 48 inches.
We need to convert this to feet: 48 inches / 12 = 4 feet.

Now, let's find the total length of the 10-foot shark and the remoras.
The total length is 10 + 4 = 14 feet.

Next, let's find the average percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras.

The total length of the 40-foot shark and the remoras is 60 feet.
The percentage of the 40-foot shark's body length covered by the remoras is (20 / 40) * 100 = 50%.

The total length of the 10-foot shark and the remoras is 14 feet.
The percentage of the 10-foot shark's body length covered by the remoras is (4 / 10) * 100 = 40%.

To find the overall average percentage, we'll find the average of the two percentages:

* He has 7 bowls, each holding 24 almonds, so the total capacity of the bowls is: 7 x 24 = 168 almonds.
* He has 3 tables, each holding 3 times the capacity of a bowl, so each table holds 3 x 24 = 72 almonds. The total capacity of the tables is: 3 x 72 = 216 almonds.

**After 2 tables break**

* The capacity of the tables is reduced by 2 tables, so the new capacity of the tables is: 216 - 2 x 72 = 216 - 144 = 72 almonds.
* The total capacity of the bowls and tables is now: 168 + 72 = 240 almonds.

**After Carlos eats one-fifth of the almonds**

**Remaining capacity**

* The total capacity of the bowls and tables is 240 almonds.
* To find out how many more almonds can be placed, we subtract the remaining capacity from the total almonds: 576 - 240 = 336 almonds.

**How many more bowls does Carlos need?**

* Each bowl can hold 24 almonds.
* To find out how many more bowls Carlos needs, we divide the remaining capacity by the capacity of each bowl: 336 / 24 = 14.

Therefore, Carlos needs 14 more bowls to place all the remaining almonds.",14.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Carlos initially has 720 almonds.

Each table can hold 3 times as many almonds as a bowl, so each table can hold 24 * 3 = 72 almonds.

Carlos has 3 tables, so initially, the tables can hold 3 * 72 = 216 almonds.

He has 7 bowls, each holding 24 almonds, so the bowls can hold 7 * 24 = 168 almonds.

Initially, the total capacity is 216 (tables) + 168 (bowls) = 384 almonds.

However, because 2 tables break, the capacity of the tables is reduced. Two tables can hold 72 * 2 = 144 almonds. The total capacity of the remaining tables is 72 (1 table) + 144 (2 tables) = 216 almonds.

The new total capacity is 216 (tables) + 168 (bowls) = 384 almonds.

Now, 2 tables break, so the capacity of the tables is 384 - 144 = 240 almonds.

So, the remaining capacity of the tables and bowls together is 240 (tables) + 168 (bowls) = 408 almonds.

Carlos eats one-fifth of the almonds, which is 720 / 5 = 144 almonds.

Now, there are 720 - 144 = 576 almonds remaining.

The bowls can hold 168 almonds, and the remaining capacity of the tables is 240 (initially) - 144 (from eaten almonds) = 96.

The total remaining capacity is 168 (bowls) + 96 (tables) = 264 almonds.

So, the remaining almonds can fit in the existing capacity, but we need to find out how many more bowls Carlos needs for the remaining almonds, which is 576 - 264 = 312 almonds.

So, each table can hold 72 almonds.
There are 3 tables, so the total number of almonds they can hold is 3 * 72 = 216 almonds.

Next, let's find out how many almonds are left after 2 tables break.
The total number of almonds in 2 tables is 2 * 72 = 144 almonds.
The number of almonds left is 720 - 144 = 576 almonds.

Carlos then eats one-fifth of all the almonds.
One-fifth of 720 almonds is 720 / 5 = 144 almonds.
Carlos eats 144 almonds, so the number of almonds left is 576 - 144 = 432 almonds.

Now, let's find out how many almonds can be placed into the 7 bowls.
Each bowl can hold 24 almonds.
So, the total number of almonds that 7 bowls can hold is 7 * 24 = 168 almonds.

To find out how many more bowls Carlos needs, let's divide the remaining almonds by 24 (the capacity of one bowl).
The number of almonds left is 432.
So, the number of bowls needed is 432 / 24 = 18.

1. Diego is 19 years old now.
2. In 9 years, Aisha will be 2 times as old as Diego is now. 
   Since Diego is 19, Aisha will be 2 * 19 = 38 years old in 9 years. 
   Aisha's current age is 38 - 9 = 29 years.
3. Diego's brother, Esteban, is 6 years younger than Diego. 
   So, Esteban's current age is 19 - 6 = 13 years.
4. Aisha's sister, Nadia, is 10 years older than Esteban.

Diego is 19 years old now. In 9 years, he will be 19 + 9 = 28 years old.

Aisha will be 2 times as old as Diego is now, so in 9 years, she will be 2 * 19 = 38 years old.

Esteban is 6 years younger than Diego, so Esteban is 19 - 6 = 13 years old now. In 9 years, he will be 13 + 9 = 22 years old.

Nadia is 10 years older than Esteban, so Nadia is 13 + 10 = 23 years old now. In 9 years, she will be 23 + 9 = 32 years old.

The store has a promotion where customers receive a $20 discount on purchases over $100. How much should Keisha pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?",85.0,"To find out how much Keisha should pay for all the skeins of wool she needs, we need to calculate the total number of skeins required and then multiply it by the cost per dozen skeins.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of skeins required for the quadruplets**

For each grandchild, Keisha needs to make:
- 1 shawl (5 skeins)
- 1 sweater (6 skeins)
- 1 poncho (8 skeins)
- 1 pair of gloves (8 skeins)
- 1 pair of mittens (14 skeins)

Total skeins per grandchild = 5 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 14 = 41 skeins

Since there are 4 grandchildren, the total number of skeins required for all of them is:
41 skeins/grandchild × 4 grandchildren = 164 skeins

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of skeins required for Keisha's warm jackets**

Keisha wants to make 2 warm jackets, each needing 8 skeins of wool:
2 jackets × 8 skeins/jacket = 16 skeins

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of skeins required**

Total skeins required = skeins for quadruplets + skeins for Keisha's jackets
= 164 skeins + 16 skeins

180 skeins ÷ 12 skeins/dozen = 15 dozen skeins

The total cost of the skeins is:
15 dozen skeins × $7/dozen = $105

**Step 5: Apply the $20 discount**

Since Keisha's purchase is over $100, she receives a $20 discount:
$105 - $20 = $85

Therefore, Keisha should pay $85 for all the skeins of wool she needs.",85.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Keisha needs to make clothes for her 4 grandchildren and 2 warm jackets for herself.

For each grandchild, she needs:
- 1 shawl (5 skeins)
- 1 sweater (6 skeins)
- 1 poncho (8 skeins)
- 2 pairs of gloves (2 x 8 = 16 skeins)
- 2 pairs of mittens (2 x 14 = 28 skeins)

Total skeins needed for each grandchild is 5 + 6 + 8 + 16 + 28 = 63 skeins.

Since there are 4 grandchildren, the total skeins needed for all grandchildren is 4 x 63 = 252 skeins.

For herself, Keisha needs 2 warm jackets, each requiring 8 skeins of wool. So, she needs 2 x 8 = 16 skeins.

In total, Keisha needs 252 + 16 = 268 skeins of wool.

Each dozen skeins of wool costs $7. Since Keisha needs 268 skeins, we need to convert this to dozens: 268 / 12 = 22.33 dozen skeins.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a dozen, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we'll calculate the cost for 22.33 dozen skeins and then add the cost of the remaining skeins.

22 dozen skeins cost 22 x $7 = $154.

The remaining 0.33 dozen skeins is equivalent to 4 skeins (since 12 x 0.33 = 4).

The cost of the remaining 4 skeins is 4 x $7 = $28.

So, the total cost of the wool is $154 + $28 = $182.

However, the store has a promotion where customers receive a $20 discount on purchases over $100. Since Keisha's purchase is over $100, she will receive the discount.

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total number of skeins of wool needed for the grandchildren's clothing.
Each grandchild needs 5 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 14 = 41 skeins of wool.
Since there are 4 grandchildren, the total number of skeins needed is 41 * 4 = 164.

Next, let's calculate the total number of skeins needed for Keisha's two warm jackets.
Each jacket needs 8 skeins of wool, so two jackets need 8 * 2 = 16 skeins.

Now, let's add the total number of skeins needed for the grandchildren's clothing and Keisha's jackets.
The total number of skeins needed is 164 + 16 = 180.

Since each dozen skeins of wool costs $7, we need to calculate how many dozens of skeins Keisha needs to buy.
180 skeins / 12 skeins per dozen = 15 dozen skeins.

The cost of 15 dozen skeins of wool is 15 * $7 = $105.

However, the store has a promotion where customers receive a $20 discount on purchases over $100.
So, Keisha will get a $20 discount on her purchase.

He has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 3 kgs of rice per day. The store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs; any additional rice is sold at the regular price. Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2. How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,"To calculate the cost of the rice, we'll break down the problem into steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the rice Mohammed needs:
Mohammed uses 3 kgs of rice per day, and there are 7 days in a week, so he needs 3 * 7 = 21 kgs of rice.

2. Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice:
The original cost is ¥15 per kg. The more expensive brand costs 20% more, so the price is 15 + (15 * 0.20) = ¥18 per kg.

3. Calculate the cost for the first 10 kgs:
Since the store has a 40% discount up to 10 kgs, we'll first calculate the discounted cost of 10 kgs:
Discounted price per kg = 18 - (18 * 0.40) = ¥10.80 per kg
Cost for 10 kgs = 10.80 * 10 = ¥108

4. Calculate the cost for the remaining 11-21 kgs (10 kgs):
The remaining 11 kgs is 21 - 10 = 11 kgs
Cost for the remaining 11 kgs = 18 * 11 = ¥198

5. Add the cost of the discounted rice and the regular-priced rice:
Total cost of rice = Cost for 10 kgs + Cost for the remaining 11 kgs = ¥108 + ¥198 = ¥306

Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2. How much does Mohammed have to pay?

A: Let's think step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice.
The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg.
The more expensive brand costs 20% more, which is 15 + (15 * 0.20) = ¥18 per kg.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of rice Mohammed needs to buy for a week.
He uses 3 kgs of rice per day.
For a week, he needs 3 * 7 = 21 kgs of rice.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the rice before the discount.
The cost of the more expensive brand is ¥18 per kg.
For 21 kgs, the total cost is 21 * 18 = ¥378.

Step 4: Calculate the discount on the rice.
The store has a 40% discount on rice up to 10 kgs.
Mohammed buys 21 kgs, so he gets the discount on the first 10 kgs.
The cost of the first 10 kgs is 10 * 18 = ¥180.
The discount on the first 10 kgs is 40% of ¥180, which is 0.40 * 180 = ¥72.
The cost of the first 10 kgs after the discount is 180 - 72 = ¥108.
For the remaining 11 kgs, there is no discount, so the cost is 11 * 18 = ¥198.
The total cost of the rice after the discount is 108 + 198 = ¥306.

Step 5: Add the cost of the bagel to the total cost of the rice.
The cost of the bagel is ¥2.
The total amount Mohammed has to pay is 306 + 2 = ¥308.

They want to reach a total of 145 signatures by the end of the break, and they already have 67 signatures, so they need to collect 145 - 67 = 78 signatures in the remaining 2 weeks.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks.
Jasmine will collect signatures on weekends only, which means she will collect signatures for 2 weeks. Since she reduces her weekly collection by 5, her new weekly collection is 36 - 5 = 31 signatures per week. So, in 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect 31 * 2 = 62 signatures.

How many ounces of water does Leon have left?",122.0,"To find out how many ounces of water Leon has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of ice cube and then subtract that from the total amount of water he started with.

Let's start by calculating the amount of water used for each type of ice cube:

1. Giant cubes: 10 cubes x 12 ounces/cube = 120 ounces
2. Medium cubes: 12 cubes x 5 ounces/cube = 60 ounces
3. Small cubes: 14 cubes x 0.5 ounces/cube = 7 ounces
4. Tiny cubes: Since tiny cubes are half the size of small cubes, they use 0.25 ounces/cube. We know that there are 48 total ice cubes, and we already know the number of giant, medium, and small cubes. So, the number of tiny cubes is 48 - (10 + 12 + 14) = 12 cubes. Therefore, the amount of water used for tiny cubes is 12 cubes x 0.25 ounces/cube = 3 ounces.

Now, let's add up the amount of water used for each type of ice cube:

120 ounces (giant) + 60 ounces (medium) + 7 ounces (small) + 3 ounces (tiny) = 190 ounces

Since Leon started with 312 ounces of water, we can subtract the amount of water used from the total amount to find out how many ounces of water he has left:

He uses 5 ounces for each medium cube.
He makes 12 medium cubes.
So, the total ounces used for medium cubes is 12 * 5 = 60 ounces.

He uses 0.5 ounces for each small cube.
He makes 14 small cubes.
So, the total ounces used for small cubes is 14 * 0.5 = 7 ounces.

Since he makes x tiny cubes with half the size of small cubes, each tiny cube uses 0.25 ounces.
The total number of tiny cubes is 48 - 10 - 12 - 14 = 12 cubes.
So, the total ounces used for tiny cubes is 12 * 0.25 = 3 ounces.

The total ounces used for all cubes is 120 + 60 + 7 + 3 = 190 ounces.

Let's call the number of students who prefer playing football ""x"". Then, the number of students who like to bake is 4x - 3.

We are also given that the number of students who prefer playing football is 13. So, x = 13.

Now, we can find the number of students who like to bake:
Number of students who like to bake = 4x - 3
= 4(13) - 3
= 52 - 3
= 49

Now, we can find the total number of students who like to hike, play chess, swim, and play football:
69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103

Now, we can find the number of students who like to play video games:
Number of students who like to play video games = Total number of students - Number of students who like to hike, play chess, swim, and play football
= 160 - 103
= 57

Now, we can find the percentage of students who like to play video games:
Percentage of students who like to play video games = (Number of students who like to play video games / Total number of students) x 100
= (57 / 160) x 100
= 0.35625 x 100
= 35.625%

So, approximately 35.63% of the students like to play video games.",35.63,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many students like to bake. We are given that the number of students that like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football. Let's denote the number of students that like to play football as F. Then, the number of students that like to bake is 4F - 3.

We are also given that the number of students that like to play football is 13. So, F = 13.

Now, we can find the number of students that like to bake:
Number of students that like to bake = 4F - 3
= 4(13) - 3
= 52 - 3
= 49

Next, we need to find the total number of students that like to hike, play chess, swim, or play football. We are given that 69 like to hike, 8 like to play chess, and 13 like to swim. We already know that 13 like to play football.

So, the total number of students that like to hike, play chess, swim, or play football is:
69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103

Now, we can find the number of students that like to play video games or bake. We are given that the total number of students is 160. So, the number of students that like to play video games or bake is:
160 - 103 = 57

Since we already know that the number of students that like to bake is 49, we can find the number of students that like to play video games:
Number of students that like to play video games = 57 - 49
= 8

Now, we can find the percentage of students that like to play video games:
Percentage of students that like to play video games = (Number of students that like to play video games / Total number of students) * 100
= (8 / 160) * 100

Oliver has also applied for help from the local charity, which has decided to cover 1/10 of the remaining cost of the workshop. How much money is Oliver still missing?",113.0,"To find out how much money Oliver is still missing, we need to calculate the total cost of the workshop and then subtract the contributions from his friends and the local charity.

The cost for one day is:
- Hotel: ₣100
- Food: ₣20 (covered by Oliver's friends)
- Transportation: ₣10

The total cost for one day is ₣100 + ₣0 (covered) + ₣10 = ₣110.

Since the workshop is 2 days long, the total cost for the workshop is ₣110 * 2 = ₣220.

Oliver has ₣85, but he needs to cover the hotel and transportation costs for 2 days, which is ₣110 * 2 = ₣220. However, his friends have covered the food costs, so we only need to subtract the hotel and transportation costs from the total cost.

Oliver still needs ₣220 - ₣85 = ₣135.

However, the charity will cover 1/10 of the remaining cost. The remaining cost is ₣135. 

To find 1/10 of ₣135, we divide it by 10:
₣135 / 10 = ₣13.50

The charity will cover ₣13.50, so we subtract this from ₣135:
₣135 - ₣13.50 = ₣121.50.

Oliver's friends have covered the cost of all the food, which is ₣20 * 2 = ₣40. So, the remaining cost is ₣260 - ₣40 = ₣220.

The local charity has agreed to cover 1/10 of the remaining cost, which is ₣220 / 10 = ₣22.

So, the remaining cost that Oliver needs to cover is ₣220 - ₣22 = ₣198.

The discount for 8 bagels is 20% of €1.25 * 8 = €2.
The discounted price for 8 bagels is €1.25 * 8 - €2 = €9 - €2 = €7.

Now we need to calculate the cost of 4 loaves of bread, which is €5 * 4 = €20.

To find out how much more 4 loaves of bread cost than 8 bagels, we subtract the cost of 8 bagels from the cost of 4 loaves of bread: €20 - €7 = €13.

Jamal starts with $80 and wants 10 gallons of paint, each priced at $7.0, and 3 carpenter pencils, each costing $2. The store offers a 10% discount on paint for members. How much more money does Elena have left than Jamal after they leave the store?",8.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Elena's purchases:**

1. 15 anchors: 15 x $0.26 = $3.90
2. 9 nails: 9 x $0.61 = $5.49
3. 10 gallons of paint: $7.00 per gallon, so 10 x $7.00 = $70.00

Total cost for Elena: $3.90 + $5.49 + $70.00 = $79.39

Since Elena has $98.39 initially, she will have:

$98.39 - $79.39 = $19.00 left

**Jamal's purchases:**

1. 10 gallons of paint: $7.00 per gallon, but Jamal gets a 10% discount as a member, so the price is $7.00 - ($7.00 x 0.10) = $6.30 per gallon. Total cost for paint: 10 x $6.30 = $63.00
2. 3 carpenter pencils: 3 x $2 = $6

Total cost for Jamal: $63.00 + $6 = $69.00

Since Jamal has $80 initially, he will have:

$80 - $69.00 = $11.00 left

**Comparison:**

Elena has $19.00 left, and Jamal has $11.00 left. Therefore, Elena has $19.00 - $11.00 = $8.00 more money than Jamal after they leave the store.",8.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate what Elena bought:

Elena starts with $98.39.
She buys 15 anchors at $0.26 each. 
15 * 0.26 = $3.90
So, she has 98.39 - 3.90 = $94.49 left.

She also buys 9 nails at $0.61 each. 
9 * 0.61 = $5.49
Now, she has 94.49 - 5.49 = $89.00.

Additionally, Elena buys 10 gallons of paint. However, we don't have the price of paint yet. We'll come back to this.

Next, let's calculate what Jamal bought:

Jamal starts with $80.
He buys 10 gallons of paint at $7.00 each. 
10 * 7.00 = $70.00
Before the 10% discount for members, Jamal has 80 - 70 = $10.

However, Jamal is a member and gets a 10% discount on the paint. 
10% of 70 is 0.1 * 70 = $7.00.
So, he gets a discount of $7.00 on the paint and now has 10 + 7 = $17.

Jamal also buys 3 carpenter pencils at $2 each. 
3 * 2 = $6.00
Now, Jamal has 17 + 6 = $23.

Now, let's get back to Elena's paint purchase: 10 gallons of paint.

Elena buys 10 gallons of paint. However, the price of paint is not given. Since we need to find how much more money Elena has left than Jamal, we will assume the price of paint to be the same for both Elena and Jamal for the sake of this calculation. They both buy 10 gallons of paint for $7.00 each. 

Elena buys 10 gallons for $7.00 each. 
10 * 7.00 = $70.00
She has $89.00 - $70.00 = $19.00 left.

Now, let's find the difference between Elena's and Jamal's money left:

Additionally, she buys 10 gallons of paint.
Jamal buys 10 gallons of paint, each costing $7.00, and 3 carpenter pencils, each costing $2.00.

Let's calculate the cost of Elena's items first.
The total cost of Elena's items is $3.90 (anchors) + $5.49 (nails) + 10 * $7.00 (paint) = $3.90 + $5.49 + $70.00 = $79.39.

Now, let's calculate the cost of Jamal's items.
The cost of Jamal's paint is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00.
The cost of Jamal's pencils is 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.
The total cost of Jamal's items is $70.00 + $6.00 = $76.00.

On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?",796.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of boxes of muffin Faisal sold on Wednesday as M, and the number of boxes of apricot pie he sold on Wednesday as P.

From the given information, we know that on Wednesday, Faisal sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie than on Thursday. So, the number of boxes of apricot pie he sold on Thursday is P + 13.

We also know that on Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday. So, the number of boxes of muffin he sold on Thursday is M + 11.

On Thursday, he sold 21 boxes of apricot pie.

Combining the information for Thursday, we get:
- M + 11 (muffins)
- P + 13 (apricot pie) = 21 (this is not correct) 
P + 13 = 21, P = 8 

Let's correct the above equation as 
- M + 11 (muffins) 
- P + 13 (apricot pie) = 21 
from this equation we can't find the value of P. We only know the value of P + 13 = 21. So the equation will be 
P = 21 - 13 
P = 8 

So he sold 8 boxes of muffin on Wednesday and 8 + 13 = 21 boxes of apricot pie.

Now let's combine the information for Wednesday and Thursday:
- M = 8 (muffins)
- P = 8 (apricot pie)

On Wednesday, the total earnings from muffins = 8 * 9 = ₺72
On Wednesday, the total earnings from apricot pie = 8 * 21 = ₺168

On Thursday, the total earnings from muffins = (8 + 11) * 9 = 19 * 9 = ₺171
On Thursday, the total earnings from apricot pie = 21 * 21 = ₺441

On Wednesday, the total earnings = ₺72 + ₺168 = ₺240
On Thursday, the total earnings = ₺171 + ₺441 = ₺612

The total earnings for the past two days = ₺240 + ₺612 = ₺852

On Friday, Faisal sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. So, he sold ₺852 on Friday.

The total earnings for all three days = ₺852 + ₺852 = ₺1704

Now, we can calculate the average daily earnings:
Average daily earnings = Total earnings / Number of days = ₺1704 / 3 = ₺568",568.0,0,"A: Let's think step by step.

To find the average daily earning, we need to find the total amount of money Faisal made in the past three days and divide it by 3.

Let's start by finding out how many boxes of muffins and apricot pies Faisal sold on each day.

On Wednesday, he sold 27 boxes of muffins.
He sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie than on Thursday, so let's call the number of apricot pies sold on Thursday x. 
   So, the number of apricot pies sold on Wednesday is x - 13.

However, we know that he sold 21 boxes of apricot pies on Thursday. 
   So, x - 13 = 21
   x = 34

So, he sold 34 boxes of apricot pies on Thursday and 21 boxes on Wednesday.

On Wednesday, the number of apricot pies sold is x - 13 = 21.
   We have already calculated the number of apricot pies sold on Thursday as 34.
   So, the number of apricot pies sold on Wednesday is 34 - 13 = 21.

On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday, so the number of muffins sold on Thursday is 27 + 11 = 38.

On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. 
   The total number of muffins sold on Wednesday and Thursday is 27 + 38 = 65.
   The total number of apricot pies sold on Wednesday and Thursday is 21 + 34 = 55.
   So, he sold 65 muffins and 55 apricot pies on Friday.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Faisal made on each day.

On Wednesday, he sold 27 boxes of muffins at ₺9 each and 21 boxes of apricot pies at ₺21 each.
   The total amount of money made on Wednesday is 27 * 9 + 21 * 21 = 243 + 441 = 684 ₺.

On Thursday, he sold 38 boxes of muffins at ₺9 each and 34 boxes of apricot pies at ₺21 each.
   The total amount of money made on Thursday is 38 * 9 + 34 * 21 = 342 + 714 = 1056 ₺.

On Friday, he sold 65 boxes of muffins at ₺9 each and 55 boxes of apricot pies at ₺21 each.
   The total amount of money made on Friday is 65 * 9 + 55 * 21 = 585 + 1155 = 1740 ₺.

Now, the total amount of money Faisal made in the past three days is 684 + 1056 + 1740 = 3480 ₺.

Finally, to find the average daily earning, we divide the total amount of money by 3.
   Average daily earning = 3480 / 3 = 1160 ₺.

The answer is 1160.",1160.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Faisal's earnings consist of muffin sales and apricot pie sales. 

First, let's calculate the sales for each day.

On Wednesday, he sold 27 boxes of muffins and 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie than on Thursday. 
Let's say the number of apricot pie boxes sold on Thursday is x.
So, the number of apricot pie boxes sold on Wednesday is x - 13.
We know that on Thursday, he sold 21 boxes of apricot pie. 
So, x - 13 = 21.
x = 34.

On Wednesday, he sold 27 boxes of muffins.
On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday.
So, the number of muffin boxes sold on Thursday is 27 + 11 = 38.

Total earnings on Wednesday = (27 muffins * ₺9) + (34 apricot pies * ₺21) = 243 + 714 = 957.
Total earnings on Thursday = (38 muffins * ₺9) + (21 apricot pies * ₺21) = 342 + 441 = 783.

The total earnings over the two days = 957 + 783 = 1740.

On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined.
So, the total sales on Friday = 1740.

Total earnings over the three days = 957 + 783 + 1740 = 3480.

To find Faisal's average daily earning, we divide the total earnings by the number of days: 3480 / 3 = 1160.

Out of the remaining class, 45% of the students are choir members or part of dancers. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away tournament. Half of the swimmers are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the tournament?",66.0,"To find the number of students leaving early, we'll break down the problem step by step.

1. First, let's find out how many students are swimmers:
   Total students in the class = 120
   Percentage of swimmers = 50%
   Number of swimmers = Total students * Percentage of swimmers
   = 120 * 0.5
   = 60

2. Now, let's find out how many students are not swimmers:
   Total non-swimmers = Total students - Number of swimmers
   = 120 - 60
   = 60

3. Next, let's find out how many non-swimmers are part of the choir or dance groups:
   Percentage of choir or dance students = 45%
   Number of choir or dance students = Total non-swimmers * Percentage of choir or dance students
   = 60 * 0.45
   = 27

4. Since half of the swimmers are absent for being sick, let's find out how many swimmers will attend:
   Swimmers attending = Number of swimmers / 2
   = 60 / 2
   = 30

5. Now, let's find the total number of students leaving early to the tournament:
   Total students leaving = (Number of swimmers attending) + (Number of choir or dance students) + (Number of swimmers attending * 3 cheerleaders) + (Number of choir or dance students * 3 cheerleaders)
   = 30 + 27 + (30 * 3) + (27 * 3)
   = 30 + 27 + 90 + 81
   = 228

However, we made an error, we should add 3 cheerleaders to the total number of students for each group and not multiply the number of swimmers attending or choir/dance students by 3. Let's correct our calculation:

   Total students leaving = (Number of swimmers attending + 3) + (Number of choir or dance students + 3) + (Number of swimmers attending + 3)
   = (30 + 3) + (27 + 3) + (30 + 3)
   = 33 + 30 + 33
   = 96

So, 96 students are leaving early to the tournament.",96.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Step 1: Find the number of swimmers in Mrs. Garcia's class.
50% of 120 students are swimmers. 
To find 50% of 120, we multiply 120 by 0.5.
So, the number of swimmers is 120 * 0.5 = 60.

Step 2: Find the number of students remaining in the class after removing the swimmers.
There are 120 students in total.
We subtract the number of swimmers (60) from the total number of students.
So, the number of remaining students is 120 - 60 = 60.

Step 3: Find the number of students in the choir or dancers.
45% of the remaining students are in the choir or dancers.
To find 45% of 60, we multiply 60 by 0.45.
So, the number of choir members or dancers is 60 * 0.45 = 27.

Step 4: Find the total number of students going to the tournament.
However, we need to consider that half of the swimmers are absent due to illness.
60 swimmers, and half of them are absent, so the number of absent swimmers is 60 / 2 = 30.
The number of swimmers going to the tournament is 60 - 30 = 30.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of students leaving the tournament, including the 3 cheerleaders accompanying each group.
The number of swimmers going to the tournament is 30.
The number of choir members or dancers is 27.
Each group has 3 cheerleaders accompanying them, but we don't know the number of groups yet.

Step 6: Determine the total number of students in the 3 groups (swimmers, choir, and dancers).
Since we know the number of swimmers and choir members or dancers, we can find the total number of students in these groups.
The total number of students in the swimmers, choir, and dancers is 30 + 27 = 57.

Step 7: Since each group has 3 cheerleaders, we need to find the number of groups.
The total number of students in the groups (swimmers, choir, and dancers) is 57, but this includes the cheerleaders. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of students in the groups by 3 and then add 1 (since the 3 cheerleaders are part of one of the groups).
However, this step can be corrected. The total number of students in the groups, including the cheerleaders, is 57 + 3x, where x is the number of groups.

Step 8: Find the correct number of groups.
Let's find the number of students who will accompany the groups as cheerleaders.
Since there are 3 cheerleaders accompanying each group, the total number of cheerleaders is 3 times the number of groups.
The number of groups can be found by dividing the total number of students in the groups, including the cheerleaders, by the number of students in each group (which is the sum of students in the group and the cheerleaders).
Let's denote the number of students in each group as S. The total number of students in the groups, including the cheerleaders, is S + 3.
We divide this by the number of students in each group, S.

So, the total number of students in the groups is (S + 3) / S.
This needs to be equal to the number of groups. Since (S + 3) / S = 3x, where x is the number of groups, we can find S.",3.0,0,"I'll solve the original problem step by step.

These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away tournament. Half of the swimmers are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the tournament?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we find the number of swimmers in the class.
50% of 120 students are swimmers.
So, the number of swimmers is 120 * 0.5 = 60.

Next, we find the number of students who are not swimmers.
The total number of students is 120.
The number of swimmers is 60.
So, the number of non-swimmers is 120 - 60 = 60.

Out of the non-swimmers, 45% are choir members or dancers.
So, the number of choir members or dancers is 60 * 0.45 = 27.

Now, we find the number of swimmers who are absent for being sick.
Half of the swimmers are absent.
So, the number of absent swimmers is 60 * 0.5 = 30.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of swimmers, choir members or dancers, and the absent swimmers.
So, the total number of students leaving early is 60 + 27 + 30 = 117.

However, we need to add the 3 cheerleaders accompanying each group.
There are 3 groups (swimmers, choir members or dancers, and absent swimmers).
So, the total number of cheerleaders is 3 * 3 = 9.

The total number of students leaving early to the tournament is 117 + 9 = 126.

Total length of the flower bed: 132m

Total number of plants = Total length / (width of each plant)

However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many plants Olga can fit in her flower bed. To do this, we need to find the total space required for each plant, including the space between them.

Each plant requires 3 meters for its width, and there are 12 meters of space between each plant. So, the total space required for each plant is 3 + 12 = 15 meters.

Now, let's divide the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant to find out how many plants Olga can fit.

132 meters (flower bed length) ÷ 15 meters (space per plant) = 8.8 plants

Since Olga can't fit a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 8 plants. However, we need to consider that Olga already owns 7 flowers, so she'll only need to buy 1 more plant.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the plants. Olga will buy 1 plant, which costs ₣9.

However, since Olga is buying more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. So, the total cost will be ₣9 - ₣5 = ₣4.

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the total length of the flower bed that needs to be covered by the plants.
The flower bed is 132 meters long.
Each plant is 3 meters wide, and there needs to be 12 meters between each plant.
So, the total length covered by each plant is 3 + 12 = 15 meters.

Next, we find the total number of plants needed to cover the flower bed.
The total length of the flower bed is 132 meters.
Each plant covers 15 meters.
So, the total number of plants needed is 132 / 15 = 8.8.

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round up to the nearest whole number.
So, Olga needs 9 plants.

However, Olga already owns 7 flowers, so she needs to buy 9 - 7 = 2 more plants.

How many minutes will it take her to peel and saute 150 clams if it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam before peeling it? Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.,163.0,"## Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to peel 150 clams
First, let's calculate the time it takes Olga to peel 150 clams. Since she can peel 6 clams per minute, we can divide 150 by 6 to get the total peeling time in minutes. peeling_time = 150 / 6 = 25 minutes.

## Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to wash 150 clams
Since it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam, we can multiply the number of clams by the washing time per clam to get the total washing time in seconds. Then we convert the total washing time from seconds to minutes. washing_time = (150 * 12) / 60 = 30 minutes.

## Step 3: Add the peeling and washing times together
Now, we add the peeling time and washing time to get the total time spent on these tasks. total_preparation_time = peeling_time + washing_time = 25 + 30 = 55 minutes.

## Step 4: Add the 13-minute break time
After peeling the clams, Olga needs to take a 13-minute break before she can start sautéing them. So, we add this break time to the total preparation time. total_time_before_sautéing = total_preparation_time + 13 = 55 + 13 = 68 minutes.

## Step 5: Calculate the time it takes to sauté 150 clams
We know that Olga can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes. To find out how long it takes her to sauté 150 clams, we can divide 150 by 30 to get the multiplier, then multiply this by 19 minutes. sautéing_time = (150 / 30) * 19 = 95 minutes.

## Step 6: Add the total time before sautéing and the sautéing time
Finally, we add the total time before sautéing and the sautéing time to get the total time it will take Olga to peel, wash, and sauté 150 clams. total_time = total_time_before_sautéing + sautéing_time = 68 + 95 = 163 minutes.

Olga peels 6 clams a minute.
She needs to peel 150 clams.
So, the time it takes to peel the clams is 150 / 6 = 25 minutes.

However, we also need to consider the time it takes to wash each clam before peeling it. It takes 12 seconds to wash each clam, and there are 150 clams. We need to convert the time from seconds to minutes.

There are 60 seconds in a minute. So, 12 seconds is equal to 12 / 60 = 0.2 minutes.

The total time it takes to wash the clams is 150 * 0.2 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes to peel the clams and the time it takes to wash the clams. We get 25 + 30 = 55 minutes.

However, we also need to consider the 13-minute break that Olga needs to take after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.

So, the total time it takes Olga to peel and sauté 150 clams is 55 + 13 = 68 minutes.

But wait, we also need to consider the time it takes Olga to sauté the clams. She can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes. To find out how long it takes her to sauté 150 clams, we need to divide 150 by 30.

Let's think step by step.
Olga can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes.
She needs to sauté 150 clams.
So, the time it takes to sauté the clams is 150 / 30 = 5 minutes.

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 50% for the second half. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?",1755.0,"To calculate the total pizzas eaten by the family, we'll break it down into two parts: the first month and the second month.

**First Month (Normal Consumption)**

Uncle's consumption: 10 pizzas/day
Spouse's consumption: 20 pizzas/day
Combined consumption: 10 + 20 = 30 pizzas/day
Grandchild's consumption: 2/4 * 30 = 15 pizzas/day
Total consumption: 30 + 15 = 45 pizzas/day

There are 30 days in a month. Total pizzas eaten in the first month: 45 pizzas/day * 30 days = 1350 pizzas.

**Second Month (Reduced Consumption)**

The first half of the month (15 days) is reduced by 60% and the second half (15 days) is reduced by an additional 50%.

1. The family's normal consumption is 45 pizzas/day. 
2. The first half of the month (15 days), their consumption is reduced by 60%, so it is 40% of the normal consumption:
   40% of 45 pizzas/day = 0.4 * 45 = 18 pizzas/day
   Total pizzas eaten in the first half of the second month: 18 pizzas/day * 15 days = 270 pizzas
3. In the second half of the second month, the consumption is reduced by an additional 50% on top of the 40% already applied. This is equivalent to a 90% reduction from the original consumption:
   90% of 45 pizzas/day = 0.9 * 45 = 40.5 pizzas/day
   Total pizzas eaten in the second half of the second month: 40.5 pizzas/day * 15 days = 606.75 pizzas
4. Total pizzas eaten in the second month: 270 pizzas + 606.75 pizzas = 876.75 pizzas

**Total Pizzas Eaten in Two Months**

Total pizzas eaten in the first month: 1350 pizzas
Total pizzas eaten in the second month: 876.75 pizzas
Total pizzas eaten in two months: 1350 + 876.75 = 2226.75 pizzas",2226.75,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Let's think step by step.

The family eats a total of 10 + 20 = 30 pizzas per day.

The grandchild eats two-fourths of the combined number of pizzas they eat per day, which is (2/4) * 30 = 15 pizzas per day.

So, the total number of pizzas eaten per day is 30 + 15 = 45 pizzas.

In one month, the family eats 45 * 30 = 1350 pizzas.

In the second month, the family reduces their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month. This means they eat 40% of their usual amount, which is 0.4 * 45 = 18 pizzas per day.

For the second half of the month, they reduce their consumption by an additional 50%, which means they eat 50% of the amount they ate in the first half of the month. This is 0.5 * 18 = 9 pizzas per day.

So, for the second half of the month, the family eats 9 pizzas per day.

The total number of pizzas eaten in the second month is (18 + 9) * 15 = 27 * 15 = 405 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas eaten in two months is 1350 + 405 = 1755 pizzas.

Staff seats: 50

Total reserved seats: 700 + 450 + 50 = 1200

Since there are 700 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

8400 / 700 = 12

So each graduate would receive 12 tickets to give to their friends and family.",12.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The Sports Arena can hold 9600 people.

However, there are some seats reserved:
- 700 seats for the graduates.
- 450 seats for the faculty attending.
- 50 seats for the staff.

So, the total number of reserved seats is 700 + 450 + 50 = 1200.

The number of seats available for the guests is 9600 - 1200 = 8400.

If the tickets are split equally among the graduates, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates. 

Unfortunately, we don't know the number of graduates. However, since we know the answer is supposed to be in the format of the previous examples, I'll assume the question is asking for a different type of answer. I'll proceed with calculating the number of guests each graduate can invite.

The number of seats available for guests is 8400. If each graduate is allowed to invite a certain number of guests, and the question is asking how many, let's represent the number of graduates as 'x'. 

Since each graduate can invite the same number of guests, the total number of guests is 'x' times the number of guests each graduate can invite.

We know the total number of guests is 8400, so we can represent this as:

x * number of guests each graduate can invite = 8400

Since we're not given the number of graduates, I'll leave the answer in this format. If you provide the number of graduates, I can proceed with the calculation.

Mohammed work overtime on the last day so he can respond to 10% more emails than usual.",61.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of emails that don't require a response**

Mohammed receives 30 emails a day. 20% of those emails don't require any response. To find the number of emails that don't require a response, we multiply 30 by 20% (or 0.20):

30 x 0.20 = 6 emails per day that don't require a response

**Step 2: Calculate the number of emails that require a response**

The number of emails that require a response is the total number of emails minus the number of emails that don't require a response:

30 - 6 = 24 emails per day that require a response

**Step 3: Calculate the number of emails that Mohammed can respond to**

From the rest of the emails that require a response, Mohammed can only respond to 2 less than half of them. To find half of the emails that require a response, we divide 24 by 2:

24 / 2 = 12 emails per day that Mohammed can respond to

Then, we subtract 2 from this number:

12 - 2 = 10 emails per day that Mohammed can respond to

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of emails that Mohammed responds to in a 6-day work week**

Since Mohammed works 6 days a week, we multiply the number of emails he can respond to per day by 6:

10 x 6 = 60 emails in a 6-day work week

**Step 5: Calculate the number of emails that Mohammed responds to on the last day**

On the last day, Mohammed works overtime and can respond to 10% more emails than usual. To find the number of emails he can respond to on the last day, we multiply the number of emails he can respond to per day by 1.10 (which is 10% more):

10 x 1.10 = 11 emails on the last day

**Step 6: Calculate the total number of emails that Mohammed responds to in a 6-day work week, including the last day**

We add the number of emails Mohammed responds to in the first 5 days to the number of emails he responds to on the last day:

60 + 11 = 71 emails in a 6-day work week

Therefore, Mohammed responds to 71 emails in a 6-day work week.",6.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Mohammed receives 30 emails a day.

He receives 20% of those emails which don't require any response. To find 20% of 30, we need to multiply 30 by 0.2:
0.2 * 30 = 6
So, 6 emails don't require any response.

The rest of the emails are 30 - 6 = 24.

Mohammed can only respond to 2 less than half of the rest of the emails. Half of 24 is:
24 / 2 = 12
2 less than 12 is:
12 - 2 = 10

So, Mohammed responds to 10 emails a day.

In a 6-day work week, Mohammed responds to:
10 * 6 = 60 emails

On the last day, Mohammed responds to 10% more emails than usual. 10% of 10 is:
0.1 * 10 = 1
So, Mohammed responds to 10 + 1 = 11 emails on the last day.

How many emails does Mohammed respond to in a 6 day work week? Mohammed work overtime on the last day so he can respond to 10% more emails than usual.

A: Let's think step by step.

Mohammed receives 30 emails a day.
20% of those emails don't require any response.
So, the number of emails that require a response is 30 - (20% of 30) = 30 - 6 = 24.
From the rest, Mohammed can only respond to 2 less than the 1/2 of them.
So, the number of emails Mohammed can respond to is 24 / 2 - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10.
In a 6 day work week, Mohammed responds to 10 * 6 = 60 emails.
On the last day, Mohammed works overtime and can respond to 10% more emails than usual.
So, on the last day, Mohammed responds to 10 * 1.1 = 11 emails.

On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?",85.0,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps.

Step 1: Calculate Ananya's original speed on the beach and sidewalk.

Let's assume Ananya's original speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

Step 2: Calculate Ananya's new speed on the beach and sidewalk after the injury.

Since Ananya's speed has decreased by half on both the beach and sidewalk, her new speed on the beach is x/2 miles per minute, and her new speed on the sidewalk is 2x/2 = x miles per minute.

Step 3: Calculate the time Ananya spends on the beach.

We are given that Ananya spends 50 minutes on the beach. Since her new speed on the beach is x/2 miles per minute, we can set up the equation:

Time = Distance / Speed
50 = 10 / (x/2)

Step 4: Solve for x.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by x/2:

50(x/2) = 10
25x = 10
x = 10/25
x = 2/5

Step 5: Calculate the time Ananya spends on the sidewalk.

Since Ananya's new speed on the sidewalk is x miles per minute, we can calculate the time she spends on the sidewalk as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 14 / (2/5)
Time = 14 * (5/2)
Time = 35 minutes

Step 6: Calculate the total time Ananya takes to complete the entire 24-mile walk.

The total time is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

Total Time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
Total Time = 50 + 35
Total Time = 85 minutes

Therefore, it takes Ananya 85 minutes to complete the entire 24-mile walk.",24.0,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ananya walks 24 miles in total, with 10 miles on the beach and 14 miles on the sidewalk.

Let's first find out how long it takes her to walk on the beach and the sidewalk at her normal speed.

On the beach, she walks 10 miles at a certain speed. Let's call this speed ""x"" miles per minute. Since she walks for 50 minutes on the beach, the distance covered is 10 miles, so we can set up the equation:

10 = 50x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides by 50:

x = 10/50
x = 0.2 miles per minute

So, Ananya's normal speed on the beach is 0.2 miles per minute.

On the sidewalk, she walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach, which is 2x = 2(0.2) = 0.4 miles per minute.

Now, let's consider the effect of her injury, which decreases her speed by half on both the beach and the sidewalk. Her new speed on the beach is 0.2 / 2 = 0.1 miles per minute, and her new speed on the sidewalk is 0.4 / 2 = 0.2 miles per minute.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for her to walk on the beach and the sidewalk at her reduced speed.

Time taken to walk on the beach = Distance / Speed = 10 / 0.1 = 100 minutes

Time taken to walk on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 14 / 0.2 = 70 minutes

The total time taken to complete the entire 24-mile walk is the sum of the time taken on the beach and the sidewalk:

Total time = 100 + 70 = 170 minutes

Q: Ananya walks 24 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 miles of walking on the beach and 14 miles of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?

A: Let's think step by step.

Ananya walks 10 miles on the beach and 14 miles on the sidewalk.
On the beach, Ananya walks at a decreased speed, which is half of her original speed.
So, her speed on the beach is x/2.
On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach.
So, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * (x/2) = x.
However, due to the injury, her speed has decreased by half on the sidewalk as well.
So, her speed on the sidewalk is x/2.

We know that Ananya spends 50 minutes walking on the beach.
Since she walks 10 miles on the beach, her speed on the beach is 10 miles / 50 minutes = 0.2 miles/minute.
So, x/2 = 0.2 miles/minute.
Solving for x, we get x = 0.4 miles/minute.

Now, we know that Ananya walks at a speed of 0.4 miles/minute on the beach and 0.4 miles/minute on the sidewalk.
We also know that she walks 10 miles on the beach and 14 miles on the sidewalk.
So, the time it takes for her to walk on the beach is 10 miles / 0.4 miles/minute = 25 minutes.
The time it takes for her to walk on the sidewalk is 14 miles / 0.4 miles/minute = 35 minutes.

The total time it takes for Ananya to complete the entire 24-mile walk is 25 minutes + 35 minutes = 60 minutes.
However, this is not the final answer. We need to consider the last day when Ananya works overtime and can respond to 10% more emails than usual.

On the last day, Ananya can respond to 10% more emails than usual.
So, she can respond to 10 * 1.1 = 11 emails on the last day.
The total number of emails Ananya responds to in a 6 day work week is 60 + 11 = 71.
However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the total time it takes for Ananya to complete the entire 24-mile walk.

Since Ananya walks 24 miles in 60 minutes, her speed is 24 miles / 60 minutes = 0.4 miles/minute.
However, we already know that Ananya's speed on the beach and sidewalk is 0.4 miles/minute.
So, the time it takes for Ananya to complete the entire 24-mile walk is indeed 60 minutes.

How much money does he make in a week?",1243.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes**

The first 2 complexes have 100 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these 2 complexes is:
100 + 100 = 200 apartments

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of apartments in the last complex**

The last complex is 35% bigger than the other 2 combined, which means it is 135% of the other 2 combined. To calculate this, we multiply the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes by 1.35:
200 x 1.35 = 270 apartments

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of apartments in all 3 complexes**

Now we add the number of apartments in the last complex to the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes:
200 + 270 = 470 apartments

**Step 4: Calculate the number of vacant apartments**

9 apartments from each of the first 2 complexes were vacant, so the total number of vacant apartments is:
9 + 9 = 18 apartments

**Step 5: Calculate the number of apartments that Oscar collects garbage from**

We subtract the number of vacant apartments from the total number of apartments:
470 - 18 = 452 apartments

The first 2 apartment complexes have 100 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these complexes is 2 * 100 = 200.

The last apartment complex is 35% bigger than the other 2 combined. To find the number of apartments in the last complex, we need to calculate 35% of 200 and add it to 200.

35% of 200 is 0.35 * 200 = 70.

So, the last complex has 200 + 70 = 270 apartments.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apartments in all 3 complexes: 200 + 270 = 470.

However, 9 apartments from each of the first 2 complexes were vacant, so we need to subtract these apartments from the total: 470 - 9 - 9 = 452.

Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each place, so he collects garbage from 452 apartments 5 times a week. The total number of collections per week is 452 * 5 = 2260.

He gets paid ₣0.5 per collection for each apartment, so his total earnings from collections per week are 2260 * 0.5 = ₣1130.

He also earns an additional 10% in tips, so his total earnings from tips per week are 10% of ₣1130, which is 0.1 * 1130 = ₣113.

   30 minutes / 2 = 15 pairs of 2 minutes
   Cost = Number of pairs * Price per pair
   Cost = 15 * ₺0.1
   Cost = ₺1.5

Now, let's add up the costs of these parts:
Total cost = ₺8 + ₺21 + ₺1.5 = ₺30.5

Since the total bill is less than ₺25, there is no discount, so the final cost is ₺30.5.",30.5,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

For the first 10 minutes, the price is ₺0.8 per minute. 
The cost for the first 10 minutes is 10 * ₺0.8 = ₺8.

For the next 30 minutes (from 11-40 minutes), the price drops to ₺0.7 per minute.
The cost for the next 30 minutes is 30 * ₺0.7 = ₺21.

For the last 20 minutes (from 41-60 minutes), the price drops to ₺0.1 per 2 minutes.
Since the price is ₺0.1 per 2 minutes, we need to convert the 20 minutes to pairs of 2 minutes, which is 10 pairs of 2 minutes. The cost for the last 20 minutes is 10 * ₺0.1 * 2 = ₺2.

The total cost for the 60-minute call is ₺8 + ₺21 + ₺2 = ₺31.

Since the total bill is more than ₺25, there's a 20% discount on the total bill.
The discount is 20% of ₺31, which is 0.2 * ₺31 = ₺6.20.

After the discount, the total bill is ₺31 - ₺6.20 = ₺24.80.

The answer is ₺24.80.",24.8,0,"Let's think step by step.

The price per minute is ₺0.8 for the first 10 minutes.
The price per minute is ₺0.7 for the next 30 minutes (from 11th to 40th minute).
The price per minute is ₺0.1 for the last 30 minutes (from 41st to 60th minute).

First, let's calculate the cost for the first 10 minutes:
The cost for the first 10 minutes is 10 * 0.8 = 8.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the next 30 minutes:
The cost for the next 30 minutes is 30 * 0.7 = 21.

Finally, let's calculate the cost for the last 30 minutes:
Since the price is ₺0.1 per 2 minutes, we need to calculate the cost for 30 minutes in terms of 2-minute intervals:
There are 15 intervals of 2 minutes in 30 minutes.
The cost for the last 30 minutes is 15 * 0.1 * 2 = 30.

Now, let's add up the costs for all three parts:
The total cost is 8 + 21 + 30 = 59.

Since the total bill is more than ₺25, we get a 20% discount on the total bill:
The discount is 20% of 59, which is 0.2 * 59 = 11.8.
The final bill after the discount is 59 - 11.8 = 47.2.

The answer is 47.2.",47.2,0

However, due to a recent injury, the janitor has become slower and it will take them twice as long to clean a room these days. If they work for 8 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?",50.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The janitor originally took 6 minutes per room.
   Due to the injury, they now take twice as long, which is 6 * 2 = 12 minutes per room.

2. The total number of rooms is 200. 
   So, the total time required to clean all rooms at the original rate would be 200 * 6 = 1200 minutes.
   At the new rate, it would take 200 * 12 = 2400 minutes.

3. Since the janitor has 10 days to complete the task, we first need to find the total minutes available in 10 days.
   There are 24 hours in a day, and 60 minutes in an hour. 
   So, the total minutes available in a day is 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes.
   In 10 days, that's 1440 * 10 = 14400 minutes.

4. The janitor works for 8 hours a day, which is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day.

5. The janitor's new rate would take 2400 minutes to clean all rooms, and they have 14400 minutes to do it.
   So, the percentage of time they spend cleaning is the time spent cleaning (2400 minutes) divided by the total time available (14400 minutes).

   To find the percentage, we can use the formula (time spent cleaning / total time available) * 100
   That is (2400 / 14400) * 100 = 16.67%

   Therefore, on average, the janitor spends approximately 16.67% of their day cleaning rooms.",16.67,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Q: A janitor has to clean a building with 200 rooms. They have 10 days to get it done. It takes them 6 minutes per room. However, due to a recent injury, the janitor has become slower and it will take them twice as long to clean a room these days. If they work for 8 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?

A: Let's think step by step.

The janitor starts with 6 minutes per room.
Due to the injury, they will take twice as long, so it will now take 6 * 2 = 12 minutes per room.

The total number of minutes they will spend cleaning in one day is the product of the time it takes per room and the number of rooms, divided by the number of days:
The total minutes per day is (12 * 200) / 10 = 240 minutes.

The janitor works for 8 hours a day, which is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning:
The percentage of time spent cleaning is (240 / 480) * 100 = 50%.

The answer is 50%.",50.0,1

As the skillet of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 70 pop in the first 10 seconds of cooking, then 2 times that amount in the next 10 seconds. The kernels increase to 4 times the initial popping rate in the next 10 seconds. In the final 10 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 10 seconds. After Noah takes the skillet off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. Noah gives one-fifth of the made popcorn to his brother Luca. How many more pieces of popcorn does Noah have to eat than his brother?",399.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 10-second interval**

* First 10 seconds: 70 kernels
* Next 10 seconds: 2 times the initial amount = 2 × 70 = 140 kernels
* Next 10 seconds: 4 times the initial amount = 4 × 70 = 280 kernels
* Final 10 seconds: half the rate of the past 10 seconds = 0.5 × 280 = 140 kernels

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of kernels that popped**

Total kernels = 70 + 140 + 280 + 140 = 530 kernels

**Step 3: Calculate the number of kernels that popped from residual heat**

A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds = 0.25 × 140 = 35 kernels

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of kernels that popped**

Total kernels = 530 (from cooking) + 35 (from residual heat) = 565 kernels

**Step 5: Calculate the number of kernels that Noah gives to his brother**

One-fifth of the total kernels = 1/5 × 565 = 113 kernels

**Step 6: Calculate the number of kernels that Noah has left**

Kernels left = Total kernels - Kernels given to brother = 565 - 113 = 452 kernels

**Step 7: Calculate the difference in the number of kernels between Noah and his brother**

Difference = Kernels left with Noah - Kernels left with Luca = 452 - 113 = 339 kernels

So, Noah has 339 more pieces of popcorn to eat than his brother.",339.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 10 seconds.

In the first 10 seconds, 70 kernels popped.
In the next 10 seconds, the kernels popped at a rate 2 times the initial rate. So, 2 * 70 = 140 kernels popped in the next 10 seconds.
In the next 10 seconds, the kernels popped at a rate 4 times the initial rate. So, 4 * 70 = 280 kernels popped in the next 10 seconds.
In the final 10 seconds, the kernels popped at a rate half the rate of the past 10 seconds. So, 0.5 * 280 = 140 kernels popped in the final 10 seconds.

Now, let's find out how many kernels popped in total. 
70 (first 10 seconds) + 140 (next 10 seconds) + 280 (next 10 seconds) + 140 (final 10 seconds) = 530 kernels popped in total.

Then, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds popped from the residual heat. 
0.25 * 140 = 35 kernels popped from the residual heat.
So, the total number of kernels is 530 + 35 = 565 kernels.

Noah gives one-fifth of the kernels to his brother Luca. 
0.2 * 565 = 113 kernels given to Luca.

To find the number of kernels Noah has, we subtract the kernels given to Luca from the total number of kernels. 
565 - 113 = 452 kernels left with Noah.

The problem asks how many more pieces of popcorn Noah has than his brother. Since Noah has 452 kernels and his brother has 113, we subtract the brother's kernels from Noah's kernels. 
452 - 113 = 339.

The answer is 339.",339.0,0,"I'll answer the original question you provided in the format you requested.

Q: Noah is popping popcorn for a snack. As the skillet of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 70 pop in the first 10 seconds of cooking, then 2 times that amount in the next 10 seconds. The kernels increase to 4 times the initial popping rate in the next 10 seconds. In the final 10 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 10 seconds. After Noah takes the skillet off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. Noah gives one-fifth of the made popcorn to his brother Luca. How many more pieces of popcorn does Noah have to eat than his brother?

A: Let's think step by step.

In the first 10 seconds, 70 kernels pop.
In the next 10 seconds, 2 times that amount pop, so 2 * 70 = 140 kernels pop.
In the next 10 seconds, 4 times the initial popping rate pop, so 4 * 70 = 280 kernels pop.
In the final 10 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate, so 280 / 2 = 140 kernels pop.
After the skillet is removed from the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds pop from the residual heat, so 140 / 4 = 35 kernels pop.
The total number of kernels that popped is 70 + 140 + 280 + 140 + 35 = 565 kernels.

Noah gives one-fifth of the made popcorn to his brother Luca, so he gives 565 / 5 = 113 kernels to Luca.
Noah has 565 - 113 = 452 kernels left.

The answer is 452 - 113 = 339.",339.0,0
gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct,"A building is made out of 5 white bricks, twice as many orange bricks, and an unknown number of green bricks. If there are 30 bricks in the building in total, what percentage of bricks are green?",50.0,"To find the percentage of green bricks, we need to first find the number of green bricks. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The building has 5 white bricks.
2. It has twice as many orange bricks as white bricks, so the number of orange bricks is 2 x 5 = 10.
3. The total number of white and orange bricks is 5 + 10 = 15.
4. Since there are 30 bricks in total, the number of green bricks is 30 - 15 = 15.

Now that we know the number of green bricks, we can find the percentage of green bricks:

Percentage of green bricks = (Number of green bricks / Total number of bricks) x 100
= (15 / 30) x 100
= 0.5 x 100
= 50%

Therefore, 50% of the bricks in the building are green.",50.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

There are 5 white bricks.
There are twice as many orange bricks as white bricks, so there are 2 * 5 = 10 orange bricks.
We are not given the number of green bricks, so let's call it x.
The total number of bricks is 5 (white) + 10 (orange) + x (green) = 30.

We can now solve for x:
5 + 10 + x = 30
15 + x = 30
x = 30 - 15
x = 15

So, there are 15 green bricks.

Now that we know the total number of bricks, we can find the percentage of green bricks:
Number of green bricks = 15
Total number of bricks = 30

The percentage of green bricks = (15 / 30) * 100
The percentage of green bricks = 0.5 * 100
The percentage of green bricks = 50%

The answer is 50%.",50.0,1,,50.0,1

Olivia, who is younger than Bodhi but older than Keisha, will be 42 in 7 years. How much younger is Keisha than the average age of all three?",18.0,"Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Olivia will be 42 in 7 years. So, her current age is 42 - 7 = 35.

2. Since Olivia and Bodhi are 24 years apart, and Olivia is younger than Bodhi, Bodhi's current age is 35 + 24 = 59.

3. Olivia and Keisha are 15 years apart, and Olivia is older than Keisha, so Keisha's current age is 35 - 15 = 20.

4. Now, let's find the average age of the three: 
   Average = (Olivia's age + Bodhi's age + Keisha's age) / 3
   Average = (35 + 59 + 20) / 3
   Average = 114 / 3
   Average = 38

5. Keisha's age is 20, so to find out how much younger she is than the average, we subtract her age from the average:
   Difference = Average - Keisha's age
   Difference = 38 - 20
   Difference = 18

So, Keisha is 18 years younger than the average age of all three.",18.0,1,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Olivia will be 42 in 7 years, so her current age is 42 - 7 = 35.

Since Olivia is 24 years younger than Bodhi, Bodhi's current age is 35 + 24 = 59.

Olivia is 15 years older than Keisha, so Keisha's current age is 35 - 15 = 20.

The average age of all three is (35 + 59 + 20) / 3 = 38.

Keisha is 20 years old, so to find out how much younger she is than the average age, we need to subtract her age from the average age: 38 - 20 = 18.

However, the question asks how much younger Keisha is than the average age of all three, which is 38. Since Keisha is younger than the average, we need to subtract her age from the average age.

The answer is 18.",18.0,1,,18.0,1
