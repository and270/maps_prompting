She bought 6 dozen croissants which cost $19 per dozen, 4 dozen macarons which cost $77 per dozen, and 3 dozen brownies for $118 per dozen. How much was the total cost if she received 25% discount on all purchases?",582.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of each item**

* 6 dozen croissants at $19 per dozen: 6 x $19 = $114
* 4 dozen macarons at $77 per dozen: 4 x $77 = $308
* 3 dozen brownies at $118 per dozen: 3 x $118 = $354

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost before discount**

Add up the costs of all the items: $114 + $308 + $354 = $776

**Step 3: Calculate the discount**

Beatriz received a 25% discount on all purchases. To calculate the discount, multiply the total cost by 0.25 (which is the same as 25%): $776 x 0.25 = $194

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost after discount**

Subtract the discount from the total cost: $776 - $194 = $582

Therefore, the total cost of Beatriz's purchases after the 25% discount is $582.",582.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the baked goods before the discount.

Beatriz bought 6 dozen croissants at $19 per dozen.
So, the cost of the croissants is 6 * $19 = $114.

She bought 4 dozen macarons at $77 per dozen.
So, the cost of the macarons is 4 * $77 = $308.

She bought 3 dozen brownies at $118 per dozen.
So, the cost of the brownies is 3 * $118 = $354.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the baked goods.
The total cost is $114 + $308 + $354 = $776.

Since Beatriz received a 25% discount on all purchases, we need to calculate the discount amount.
The discount amount is 25% of $776, which is 0.25 * $776 = $194.

Now, let's subtract the discount amount from the total cost to get the final amount Beatriz paid.
The final amount is $776 - $194 = $582.

The answer is $582.",582.0,1,,582.0,1

But as I pour it, I spill 7 liters of the mango drink. To make up for that, I add 7 liters of water to the mix. What percentage of the final mix is water?",50.0,"To find the percentage of water in the final mix, we need to calculate the total amount of water and the total amount of the final mix.

1. Initially, you have 16 liters of mango drink, which is one-ninth water. So the amount of water in the 16 liters of mango drink is 16 * (1/9) = 1.78 liters (approximately).

2. You also have 14 liters of apple drink, which is one-half water. So the amount of water in the 14 liters of apple drink is 14 * (1/2) = 7 liters.

3. Now, you add 16 liters of mango drink + 14 liters of apple drink = 30 liters of the mix. But you spill 7 liters of the mango drink. So, the total amount of the mix after spilling is 30 - 7 = 23 liters.

4. The amount of water after spilling the mango drink is 1.78 liters (from the mango drink) + 7 liters (from the apple drink) = 8.78 liters.

5. To make up for the spilled drink, you add 7 liters of water to the mix. Now, the total amount of water in the mix is 8.78 liters + 7 liters = 15.78 liters.

6. The total amount of the final mix is 23 liters (initial mix) + 7 liters (water added) = 30 liters.

7. To find the percentage of water in the final mix, we divide the total amount of water by the total amount of the final mix and multiply by 100: (15.78 / 30) * 100 â‰ˆ 52.6%.

So, the percentage of water in the final mix is approximately 52.6%.",52.6,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's find out how much water is in the initial 16 liters of mango drink. It's one-ninth water, so we multiply 16 by 1/9 to get the amount of water in the mango drink.

16 * (1/9) = 16/9 = 1.78 liters of water in the mango drink.

Now, let's find out how much water is in the initial 14 liters of apple drink. It's one-half water, so we multiply 14 by 1/2 to get the amount of water in the apple drink.

14 * (1/2) = 7 liters of water in the apple drink.

Now, we need to add the mango drink and the apple drink. But we spill 7 liters of the mango drink, so we subtract that from the total volume of the mango drink before adding it to the apple drink.

The volume of the mango drink after spilling is 16 - 7 = 9 liters.

The total volume of the mixture is 9 liters (remaining mango drink) + 14 liters (apple drink) = 23 liters.

The amount of water in the mixture is the sum of the water in the mango drink and the apple drink.

1.78 liters (water in mango drink) + 7 liters (water in apple drink) = 8.78 liters of water.

To find the percentage of the final mix that is water, we divide the amount of water by the total volume of the mixture and multiply by 100.

(8.78 liters / 23 liters) * 100 = 38.17%

1. Mei can skip at 2 miles per hour.

Since she can skip at 1/2 the speed of her running speed, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2:

Running speed = 2 miles/hour Ã— 2 = 4 miles/hour

2. Mei can run four times faster than she can walk.

Let's call her walking speed ""x"" miles per hour. Then, her running speed is 4x miles per hour. We already know that her running speed is 4 miles per hour, so we can set up the equation:

4x = 4

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

x = 1 mile/hour

So, Mei can walk at 1 mile per hour.

3. Time spent running: 2/5 of 10 hours = 4 hours
Time spent skipping: 1/2 of 10 hours = 5 hours
Time spent walking: 10 hours - 4 hours - 5 hours = 1 hour

4. Distance traveled while running: 4 hours Ã— 4 miles/hour = 16 miles
Distance traveled while skipping: 5 hours Ã— 2 miles/hour = 10 miles
Distance traveled while walking: 1 hour Ã— 1 mile/hour = 1 mile

Therefore, Mei can travel 27 miles in 10 hours.",10.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Mei can skip at a rate of 2 miles per hour.

Since she can skip at 1/2 as fast as she can run, her running speed is 2 / (1/2) = 2 * 2 = 4 miles per hour.

Mei can run four times faster than she can walk, so her walking speed is 4 / 4 = 1 mile per hour.

She spends 2/5 of the time running, which is 2/5 * 10 = 4 hours.

She spends 1/2 of the time skipping, which is 1/2 * 10 = 5 hours.

The remaining time is 10 - 4 - 5 = 1 hour, which she spends walking.

So, the total distance traveled while running is 4 hours * 4 miles per hour = 16 miles.

The total distance traveled while skipping is 5 hours * 2 miles per hour = 10 miles.

Your daily calorie target is 2300, and you have already consumed 1200 calories. Additionally, you have exercised for 100 calories. However, since you burned 100 calories, they should be subtracted from the calories consumed. So, the total calories you have consumed is 1200 - 100 = 1100 calories.

Your remaining daily calorie target is 2300 - 1100 = 1200 calories.

Since each serving of cookies has 200 calories, you can calculate the total calories from the bag by multiplying the number of servings by the calories per serving. The 150 oz bag has 5 servings, so 5 servings * 200 calories/serving = 1000 calories.

To find out how many ounces you can eat, you can divide the calories you still have available (1200) by the calories per serving (200).

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total calories in the 150 oz bag.
The bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 200 calories.
So, the total calories in the bag is 5 * 200 = 1000 calories.

You have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories, so you have used a total of 1200 + 100 = 1300 calories.

Your daily calorie target is 2300, and you have used 1300 calories, so you have 2300 - 1300 = 1000 calories left.

Since each serving of cookies has 200 calories, you can eat 1000 / 200 = 5 servings.

Since each serving is 150 oz / 5 = 30 oz, you can eat 5 * 30 = 150 oz.

Therefore, Pavel will make â‚º330 after receiving a 10% tip on every purchase.",10.0,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Pavel sells three kinds of flowers. Let's find out how much he will make from each type of flower after rounding the prices to the nearest dollar.

Tulips are sold for â‚º3.24, which rounds to $3 per basket.
Lilies are sold for â‚º3.57, which rounds to $3 per basket.
Orchids are sold for â‚º5.16, which rounds to $5 per basket.

Pavel sells:
- 19 baskets of tulips at $3 per basket, so the total for tulips is 19 * 3 = $57.
- 17 baskets of lilies at $3 per basket, so the total for lilies is 17 * 3 = $51.
- 35 baskets of orchids at $5 per basket, so the total for orchids is 35 * 5 = $175.

Now, let's find out the total amount Pavel will make: $57 + $51 + $175 = $283.

Pavel will receive a 10% tip on every purchase. To find the total tip, multiply the total amount by 0.1 (which is 10%): $283 * 0.1 = $28.30.

Now, let's add the tip to the total amount: $283 + $28.30 = $311.30.

The answer is $311.30.",311.3,0,"I'll provide the corrected solution in the format you requested.

Q: Pavel has a flower stand at the community market. Pavel sells three kinds of flowers: tulips, lilies and orchids. Pavel usually sells tulips for â‚º3.24 per basket, lilies for â‚º3.57 per basket and orchids for â‚º5.16 per basket. Pavel has no change today, so Pavel has decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. Pavel sells 19 baskets of tulips, 17 baskets of lilies and 35 baskets of orchids. How much will Pavel make, after receiving a 10% tip on every purchase?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Pavel made from selling the flowers.
The price of tulips is â‚º3.24 per basket, and Pavel sold 19 baskets, so the total amount of money made from tulips is 19 * 3.24 = â‚º61.56.
The price of lilies is â‚º3.57 per basket, and Pavel sold 17 baskets, so the total amount of money made from lilies is 17 * 3.57 = â‚º60.89.
The price of orchids is â‚º5.16 per basket, and Pavel sold 35 baskets, so the total amount of money made from orchids is 35 * 5.16 = â‚º180.60.

So, the total amount of money Pavel made from selling the flowers is 61.56 + 60.89 + 180.60 = â‚º303.05.

Next, let's calculate the 10% tip on every purchase.
The total amount of money Pavel made is â‚º303.05, and the tip is 10% of this amount, so the tip is 0.10 * 303.05 = â‚º30.30.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money Pavel will make, including the tip.
The total amount of money Pavel made from selling the flowers is â‚º303.05, and the tip is â‚º30.30, so the total amount of money Pavel will make is 303.05 + 30.30 = â‚º333.35.

She already has 12 potted plants on each of the 65 window ledges of her large country home. She also purchased 140 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 4 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Kayla remain with?",703.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of potted plants Kayla already has on her window ledges**

She has 12 potted plants on each of the 65 window ledges, so:

12 potted plants/ledge Ã— 65 ledges = 780 potted plants

**Step 2: Add the new potted plants she received last week**

She received 43 new potted plants:

780 potted plants (already had) + 43 potted plants (new) = 823 potted plants

**Step 3: Add the new potted plants she purchased yesterday**

She purchased 140 new plants at a 50% discount, which means she got 50% off the original price. However, this information is not necessary to calculate the total number of plants she has. We can simply add the number of plants she purchased:

823 potted plants (already had) + 140 potted plants (new) = 963 potted plants

**Step 4: Calculate the number of potted plants she will give away**

She will give 4 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family, and she has 65 ledges:

4 potted plants/ledge Ã— 65 ledges = 260 potted plants

**Step 5: Calculate the total number of potted plants Kayla will remain with**

Subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she has:

963 potted plants - 260 potted plants = 703 potted plants

Therefore, Kayla will remain with 703 potted plants.",703.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Kayla starts with the plants she already has. 
She has 65 window ledges, and each has 12 plants.
So, the total number of plants she already has is 65 * 12 = 780.

She received 43 new plants from the nursery.
So, the total number of plants she has now is 780 + 43 = 823.

She then bought 140 new plants at a 50% discount.
Since it's a 50% discount, she paid for half the price, which is 140 / 2 = 70 plants.
So, the total number of plants she has now is 823 + 70 = 893.

Kayla gives 4 plants from each of the 65 window ledges to her friends and family.
So, she gives away a total of 65 * 4 = 260 plants.

Now, let's find out how many plants Kayla has left.
She had 893 plants and gave away 260.
So, the number of plants left is 893 - 260 = 633.

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Kayla already has on her window ledges.
She has 12 potted plants on each of the 65 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants is 12 * 65 = 780.

Next, let's calculate the total number of new potted plants Kayla received and purchased.
She received 43 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery, and she purchased 140 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount. Since she purchased at a 50% discount, she actually paid for 140 / 2 = 70 new plants. So, the total number of new potted plants is 43 + 70 = 113.

Now, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Kayla has before giving any away.
She already had 780 potted plants, and she received and purchased 113 new potted plants, so the total number of potted plants is 780 + 113 = 893.

Next, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Kayla will give away.
She will give 4 potted plants from each of the 65 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants she will give away is 4 * 65 = 260.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Kayla will remain with.
She had 893 potted plants and will give away 260, so the total number of potted plants she will remain with is 893 - 260 = 633.

On Monday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. On Tuesday, he finished homework early and watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. On Wednesday, he got to stay up late, so he watched two 5-hour episodes. On Thursday, he watched four episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 24 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?",5.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Noah watched TV for a total of 24 hours. We also know that he watched TV for different lengths of time on each day.

On Saturday and Sunday, he watched 4-hour episodes each night, which is a total of 8 hours per day. Since there are 2 days, the total hours watched on these days is 8 x 2 = 16 hours.

On Tuesday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. We need to convert the 45-minute show to hours, which is 45/60 = 0.75 hours. So, the total hours watched on Tuesday is 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched two 5-hour episodes, which is a total of 10 hours.

On Thursday, he watched four episodes, each 15 minutes. We need to convert the 15-minute episodes to hours, which is 15/60 = 0.25 hours per episode. Since there are 4 episodes, the total hours watched on Thursday is 4 x 0.25 = 1 hour.

Now, let's add up the total hours watched on each day:

Saturday and Sunday: 16 hours
Monday: x hours (we don't know this yet)
Tuesday: 3.75 hours
Wednesday: 10 hours
Thursday: 1 hour

Total hours watched: 16 + x + 3.75 + 10 + 1 = 30.75 + x

We know that the total hours watched is 24 hours, so we can set up an equation:

30.75 + x = 24

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 30.75 from both sides:

x = 24 - 30.75
x = -6.75

However, we can't have a negative number of hours, so this doesn't make sense. Let's go back to the problem and see if we can find another way to solve it.

We know that Noah watched 15-minute episodes on Monday, and we want to find out how many of these episodes he watched. Let's call the number of episodes ""n"". Since each episode is 15 minutes, the total time watched on Monday is 15n minutes.

We know that the total time watched on Monday is x hours, where x is the number of hours we found earlier. We can convert x to minutes by multiplying by 60:

x hours x 60 minutes/hour = 60x minutes

Since we know that the total time watched on Monday is 15n minutes, we can set up an equation:

60x = 15n

We know that x is not a whole number, but n is a whole number. We can try to find a value of n that makes the equation true.

Let's try n = 1:

60x = 15(1)
60x = 15
x = 15/60
x = 0.25

This doesn't seem right, since we know that x is not a whole number. Let's try n = 2:

60x = 15(2)
60x = 30
x = 30/60
x = 0.5

This still doesn't seem right. Let's try n = 3:

60x = 15(3)
60x = 45
x = 45/60
x = 0.75

This is getting closer, but we still need to find a value of n that makes the equation true.

Let's try n = 4:

60x = 15(4)
60x = 60
x = 60/60
x = 1

This seems right, since we know that x is not a whole number. However, we need to check if this value of n makes the equation true.

60x = 15n
60(1) = 15(4)
60 = 60

This is true, so we have found the correct value of n.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",4.0,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Let's think step by step.
Noah watched TV for a total of 24 hours.
On Saturday and Sunday, he watched 4-hour episodes each night, so he watched 2 * 4 = 8 hours on those days.
On Monday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes x. Since each episode is 15 minutes, the total time he watched on Monday is 15x minutes. We need to convert this to hours, so we divide by 60: (15x)/60 = 0.25x hours.
On Tuesday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. We need to convert the 45-minute show to hours: 45/60 = 0.75 hours. So, the total time he watched on Tuesday is 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.
On Wednesday, he watched two 5-hour episodes, so he watched 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he watched four episodes, each 15 minutes. We need to convert this to hours: 4 * 15/60 = 1 hour.
Now, let's add up the total time he watched on each day: 8 + 0.25x + 3.75 + 10 + 1 = 23.25 + 0.25x hours.
We know that the total time he watched is 24 hours, so we can set up the equation: 23.25 + 0.25x = 24.
Now, let's solve for x: 0.25x = 24 - 23.25 = 0.75.
Divide both sides by 0.25: x = 0.75 / 0.25 = 3.
So, Noah watched 3 episodes of the 15-minute show on Monday.
The answer is 3.",3.0,0,"I see what's going on here. I made a mistake in my previous response. Let me provide the correct solution in the examples format.

Q: A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 41 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city. If the city is 18 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/3 of the city?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total distance the fog bank covers in 41 minutes.
It takes 41 minutes to cover every 3 miles, so the total distance covered in 41 minutes is 41 * 3 = 123 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance the fog bank needs to cover to reach 1/3 of the city.
The city is 18 miles across, so 1/3 of the city is 18 / 3 = 6 miles.

Now, let's calculate the time it will take for the fog bank to cover 1/3 of the city.
Since it takes 41 minutes to cover 3 miles, it will take 41 / 3 * 1 = 13.67 minutes to cover 1 mile. To cover 6 miles, it will take 13.67 * 6 = 82 minutes.

However, this is not the correct answer. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 41 minutes. To find the time it takes to cover 1 mile, we can divide 41 by 3, which is 41 / 3 = 13.67 minutes. To find the time it takes to cover 6 miles, we can multiply 13.67 by 6, which is 82 minutes. However, this is not the correct answer.

If she used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.",504.0,"## Step 1: Determine the ratio of sugar to water
The ratio of sugar to water is given as 63:14.

## Step 2: Determine the ratio of water to milk
The ratio of water to milk is given as 7:9.

## Step 3: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the water ratios
To combine the ratios, we need to find the LCM of 14 and 7, which is 14.

## Step 4: Scale the sugar ratio to match the LCM
To match the LCM of 14, we multiply the sugar ratio by 1 (since 63 is already a multiple of 7 and 14 is a multiple of 7), so the sugar ratio remains 63:14.

## Step 5: Scale the milk ratio to match the LCM
To match the LCM of 14, we multiply the milk ratio by 2 (since 7 is a factor of 14), so the milk ratio becomes 18:14.

## Step 6: Combine the ratios
Now we have the combined ratio of sugar:water:milk as 63:14:18.

## Step 7: Determine the total number of parts in the ratio
The total number of parts in the ratio is 63 + 14 + 18 = 95.

## Step 8: Find the value of one part
To find the value of one part, we divide the total amount of sugar (760 teaspoons) by the number of parts of sugar in the ratio (63). 760 / 63 = 12.079 (approximately).

## Step 9: Calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used
Since the value of one part is approximately 12.079, we multiply this by the number of parts of sugar in the ratio (63) to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used. 12.079 * 63 = 760.

The final answer is: $\boxed{760}$",760.0,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Let's think step by step.
The ratio of sugar to water is 63:14.
This means that for every 63 teaspoons of sugar, Fatima uses 14 cups of water.
The ratio of water to milk is 7:9.
This means that for every 7 cups of water, Fatima uses 9 tablespoons of milk.
We can use the ratio of sugar to water to find the number of cups of water used.
Let's say the number of cups of water used is x.
Then, the number of teaspoons of sugar used is 63x.
We are given that the total number of teaspoons of sugar used is 760.
So, we can set up the equation: 63x = 760.
To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 63:
x = 760 / 63
x = 12.06 (approximately)
Now that we know the number of cups of water used, we can find the number of tablespoons of milk used.
Let's say the number of tablespoons of milk used is y.
Then, the number of cups of water used is 7y.
We know that x = 12.06, so we can set up the equation: 7y = 12.06.
To solve for y, we can divide both sides by 7:
y = 12.06 / 7
y = 1.73 (approximately)
Now that we know the number of tablespoons of milk used, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar used.
We know that the ratio of sugar to water is 63:14, and the number of cups of water used is x = 12.06.
So, the number of teaspoons of sugar used is 63x = 63(12.06) = 759.78.

Q: Fatima makes coffee using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 63:14. She also uses 9 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water. If she used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.

First, let's find the total number of cups of water used.
The ratio of sugar to water is 63:14, so for every 63 teaspoons of sugar, 14 cups of water are used.
Let's assume the number of teaspoons of sugar used is x.
Then, the number of cups of water used is 14x/63.

Next, let's find the total number of tablespoons of milk used.
She uses 9 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water.
So, the number of tablespoons of milk used is (14x/63) * 9 / 7.

Now, let's add up the total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk used.
The total is x + 14x/63 + (14x/63) * 9 / 7.

We are given that the total is 760.
So, we can set up the equation:
x + 14x/63 + (14x/63) * 9 / 7 = 760

To solve for x, we can start by simplifying the equation:
x + 14x/63 + 18x/63 = 760
Combine like terms:
(63x + 14x + 18x) / 63 = 760
Combine like terms:
95x / 63 = 760

Now, let's multiply both sides by 63 to get rid of the fraction:
95x = 760 * 63
95x = 47880

Now, let's divide both sides by 95 to solve for x:
x = 47880 / 95
x = 505.26

Since we are looking for the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, we can round x to the nearest whole number.

She noticed that she was out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new package of spoons. Later, her husband also bought a package of 17 new spoons and gave them to Rania. While Rania was making the shrimp scampi, she used eleven of the spoons to sample her shrimp scampi. The guests also brought 3 packs of spoons, each having 13 inside them. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 86 spoons. How many spoons were in the package that Rania bought?",41.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Rania's husband bought a package of 17 new spoons.
2. Rania used 11 spoons to sample her shrimp scampi.
3. The guests brought 3 packs of spoons, each with 13 spoons inside, so they brought a total of 3 x 13 = 39 spoons.
4. Rania had a total of 86 spoons left after using some and receiving new ones.

To find out how many spoons were in the package that Rania bought, we need to subtract the number of spoons that Rania's husband, Rania herself, and the guests brought from the total number of spoons.

Let x be the number of spoons in the package that Rania bought.

The total number of spoons is 86. We subtract the number of spoons that Rania's husband, Rania herself, and the guests brought:

86 = x + 17 (Rania's husband) + 11 (Rania) + 39 (guests)

Combine the constants:

86 = x + 67

Subtract 67 from both sides:

19 = x

So, the package that Rania bought had 19 spoons.",19.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Rania starts with some spoons, but we don't know how many.
She buys a new package of spoons.
Her husband gives her 17 more spoons.
She uses 11 spoons to sample her shrimp scampi.
Her guests bring 3 packs of 13 spoons each, so a total of 3 * 13 = 39 spoons.
So, the number of spoons she had after the guests arrived is 39 + 11 (the spoons she used) = 50.
When she sets the table, she has a total of 86 spoons.
So, the total number of spoons Rania has at the beginning and bought is 86.
The number of spoons at the beginning and the 17 her husband gave her is 50.
So, the number of spoons she bought is 86 - 50 - 17 = 19.
However, since we initially found that she had 50 spoons after receiving the 17 spoons from her husband, we need to set up the equation as follows: Rania had some spoons, got 19 more from the store, and received 17 from her husband. Then she used 11 and got 39. Since we know that the total number of spoons is 86, we can represent this as:
Spoons at the beginning + 19 + 17 - 11 + 39 = 86

Simplifying this expression: 
Let x be the number of spoons at the beginning.
x + 19 + 17 - 11 + 39 = 86
x + 64 = 86.
Subtract 64 from both sides: 
x = 22

Since she bought 19 spoons and had 22 at the start, the answer is actually 19.",19.0,0,"Q: Fatima makes coffee using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 63:14. She also uses 9 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water. If she used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's find the total number of cups of water used.
The ratio of sugar to water is 63:14, so for every 63 teaspoons of sugar, 14 cups of water are used.
Let's assume the number of teaspoons of sugar used is x.
Then, the number of cups of water used is 14x/63.

Next, let's find the total number of tablespoons of milk used.
She uses 9 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water.
So, the number of tablespoons of milk used is (14x/63) * 9 / 7.

Now, let's add up the total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk used.
The total is x + 14x/63 + (14x/63) * 9 / 7.

We are given that the total is 760.
So, we can set up the equation:
x + 14x/63 + (14x/63) * 9 / 7 = 760

To solve for x, we can start by simplifying the equation:
x + 14x/63 + 18x/63 = 760
Combine like terms:
(63x + 14x + 18x) / 63 = 760
Combine like terms:
95x / 63 = 760

Now, let's multiply both sides by 63 to get rid of the fraction:
95x = 760 * 63
95x = 47880

Now, let's divide both sides by 95 to solve for x:
x = 47880 / 95
x = 505.26

The result is not an integer. However, let's continue with the equation.
x = 47880 / 95
x = 505.26

Since we cannot have a fraction of a teaspoon, we need to find the closest integer value for x.
However, let's try to simplify the equation again.

x + 14x/63 + (14x/63) * 9 / 7 = 760

To simplify, let's first calculate (14x/63) * 9 / 7:
(14x/63) * 9 / 7 = (14x * 9) / (63 * 7) = (126x) / 441

Now, let's replace this value in the equation:
x + 14x/63 + (126x/441) = 760

To solve for x, we can start by finding a common denominator for the fractions:
x + (14x * 7) / (63 * 7) + (126x) / (441) = 760
x + 98x/441 + 126x/441 = 760

Now, let's combine the fractions:
(441x + 98x + 126x) / 441 = 760

Combine like terms:
(665x) / 441 = 760

Now, let's multiply both sides by 441 to get rid of the fraction:
665x = 760 * 441
665x = 334960

Now, let's divide both sides by 665 to solve for x:
x = 334960 / 665
x = 502.43

Since we cannot have a fraction of a teaspoon, we need to find the closest integer value for x.
x = 502

1. Calculate the total area of the orange field in square meters:
   Jin has 55 square meters of orange field.

2. Determine the total number of oranges per square meter:
   There are 44 oranges per one-half a square meter. Since a square meter is equal to two half-square meters, we multiply the number of oranges per half-square meter by 2:
   44 oranges/half-square meter * 2 half-square meters/square meter = 88 oranges/square meter

3. Calculate the total number of oranges per square meter:
   Jin has 55 square meters of orange field, so we multiply the number of oranges per square meter by the total number of square meters:
   88 oranges/square meter * 55 square meters = 4840 oranges

1. Fatima has six times as many friends as Noah. Since Fatima has 108 friends, we can set up an equation to find Noah's number of friends:
   Let N represent Noah's number of friends.
   Fatima's friends = 6N
   We know Fatima has 108 friends.
   6N = 108
   Solve for N by dividing both sides by 6:
   N = 108 / 6
   N = 18

2. Jasmine has two times as many friends as Noah. Since Noah has 18 friends, we can find Jasmine's number of friends:

Average friends = (Fatima's friends + Noah's friends + Jasmine's friends) / 3
Average friends = (108 + 18 + 36) / 3
Average friends = 162 / 3
Average friends = 54

The average number of LinkedIn friends for Fatima, Noah, and Jasmine is 54.",54.0,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Fatima has 108 friends on LinkedIn.
Fatima has six times as many friends as Noah, so we can represent the number of Noah's friends as x. This means that 6x = 108.
To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6: x = 108 / 6 = 18.
So, Noah has 18 friends on LinkedIn.

Jasmine has two times as many friends as Noah, so we can represent the number of Jasmine's friends as 2x. Since we know that x = 18, we can multiply 2 by 18 to find the number of Jasmine's friends: 2x = 2 * 18 = 36.

Now that we know the number of friends each person has, we can find the average number of friends: (108 + 18 + 36) / 3 = 162 / 3 = 54.

- She'll also lose 3 more hours of consulting work, so that's 3 * 82 = â‚£246.

Isabella has the option to either do her taxes herself or hire a financial advisor. We need to compare the income she'll earn if she does her taxes herself with the cost of hiring a financial advisor.

If Isabella does her taxes herself, she'll lose two types of income:
1. She'll be able to do 12 fewer hours of consulting work, resulting in a loss of 12 * â‚£82 = â‚£984.
2. She'll need to spend 3 hours mailing the completed tax documents, which is a loss of 3 * â‚£82 = â‚£246.

Total income lost if she does the taxes herself is â‚£984 + â‚£246 = â‚£1230.

The cost of hiring a financial advisor is â‚£82 per hour.

To find out how much more money she'll have if she hires a financial advisor, we need to calculate the difference between the income she loses and the cost of the advisor.

So, the difference is â‚£1230 (income lost) + â‚£82 (cost of the advisor) = â‚£1312.

However, it is not entirely clear that the extra 82 she is paying in the advisor is actually a loss for her, the question is asking for how much more money she will have if she hires an advisor. To make that clear, let's rephrase our previous answer as follows:

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row?,43.75,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 and the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row, and then find the difference between the two probabilities.

**Probability of rolling a number greater than 10:**

There are 10 numbers greater than 10 on a 20-sided die (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20). So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is:

10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5

**Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row:**

The probability of rolling an odd number on a 20-sided die is 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5, since there are 10 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19) out of 20.

To find the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row, we need to multiply the probability of rolling an odd number four times:

(1/2) Ã— (1/2) Ã— (1/2) Ã— (1/2) = 1/16 = 0.0625

**Difference between the two probabilities:**

Now, we need to find the difference between the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 and the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row:

0.5 - 0.0625 = 0.4375

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.4375 Ã— 100 = 43.75%

So, Luis is 43.75% more likely to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll four odd numbers in a row.",10.0,0,"To determine how much more likely it is for Luis to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll four odd numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probability of each event.

**Calculating the probability of rolling a number greater than 10:**

A standard 20-sided die has the numbers 1-20. There are 10 numbers greater than 10 (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20). 

The probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is the number of favorable outcomes (10) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (20). 

So, the probability is 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

**Calculating the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row:**

There are 10 odd numbers on a 20-sided die (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19). 

To roll four odd numbers in a row, Luis must roll an odd number for each of the four consecutive rolls. 

The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5.

Since the rolls are independent events, we multiply the probabilities of each event. 

The probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16 = 0.0625 or 6.25%.

**Comparing the probabilities:**

To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll four odd numbers in a row, we subtract the probability of rolling four odd numbers from the probability of rolling a number greater than 10.

The difference is 50% - 6.25% = 43.75%.

He also found that there were 1/6 as many ladybugs as ants. To find the number of ladybugs, we will first find the total number of ladybugs and ants (since we know the ratio between the two).
Let's call the number of ladybugs 'x'. We know that there are 24 ants, and the ratio of ladybugs to ants is 1/6.
So, x / 24 = 1/6. 

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 24:
x = 24 * (1/6)
x = 4

So, there are 4 ladybugs. 

Now, let's add up the total number of animals:

1. Yuki stopped being pen pals with 4 people, but he still has 8 - 4 = 4 pen pals left.

2. Each of his 4 pen pals sends 3 letters a week, and each letter is 10 pages long. So, each pen pal sends 3 x 10 = 30 pages per week.

3. Since Yuki has 4 pen pals, the total number of pages he receives per week is 4 x 30 = 120 pages.

4. Yuki responds in kind, so he sends 120 pages back to his pen pals each week.

5. Since Yuki can write 1 page every 14 minutes, the total time he spends writing per week is 120 pages x 14 minutes/page = 1680 minutes.

6. To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 1680 minutes Ã· 60 = 28 hours.

Yuki was pen pals with 8 people, but stopped being pen pals with 4 of them. 
So, he is still pen pals with 8 - 4 = 4 people.

Each of them sends 3 letters a week, and each letter is 10 pages long. 
So, the total number of pages they send him per week is 4 * 3 * 10 = 120 pages.

Since he responds in kind, he sends 120 pages as well.

In a week, he has to write 120 pages for his pen pals.

Since he can write 1 page every 14 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes he spends writing in a week.

There are 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day, and 7 days in a week. 
So, the total number of minutes in a week is 7 * 24 * 60 = 10080 minutes.

Since he writes 120 pages in a week, and each page takes 14 minutes, the total time he spends writing in a week is 120 * 14 = 1680 minutes.

To find the time he spends writing per day, we divide the total weekly writing time by 7:

We know that two-thirds of the total number of people left after 45 minutes. To find the number of people who left, we need to calculate two-thirds of the initial total number of people. people_left = (2/3) * total_people = (2/3) * 72 = 48.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of people who remained at the gathering.
Since 48 people left, the number of people who remained can be found by subtracting the number of people who left from the initial total number of people. people_remaining = total_people - people_left = 72 - 48 = 24.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of nurses who remained at the gathering.
We know that 22 lawyers remained, and we need to find out how many nurses stayed. Since the total number of people remaining is 24, and 22 of them are lawyers, the number of nurses who remained can be found by subtracting the number of lawyers from the total number of people remaining. nurses_remaining = people_remaining - lawyers = 24 - 22 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",2.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

At the beginning, there were 72 people in total, out of which 23 were lawyers and the rest were nurses. 

So, the number of nurses at the beginning is 72 - 23 = 49.

After 45 minutes, two-thirds of the people left. 
The total number of people who left is 2/3 * 72 = 48.

So, the number of people who remained is 72 - 48 = 24.

We are given that 22 lawyers remained.
Since the total number of people who remained is 24, the number of nurses who remained is 24 - 22 = 2.

In the third year, the stock price increases by 25%. By the end of the third year, how much profit has Ananya made?",435.0,"To find the profit Ananya made, we need to calculate the final value of her shares and subtract the initial value.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial value of Ananya's shares**

Ananya buys 12 shares of a stock for Â¥80 each. So, the initial value of her shares is:

12 shares Ã— Â¥80/share = Â¥960

**Step 2: Calculate the value of Ananya's shares after the first year**

The stock price increases by 55% in the first year. To find the new value of the shares, we need to calculate 55% of the initial value and add it to the initial value.

55% of Â¥960 = 0.55 Ã— Â¥960 = Â¥528

New value of shares after the first year = Initial value + Increase
= Â¥960 + Â¥528
= Â¥1488

**Step 3: Calculate the value of Ananya's shares after the second year**

The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. To find the new value of the shares, we need to calculate 25% of the value after the first year and subtract it from the value after the first year.

25% of Â¥1488 = 0.25 Ã— Â¥1488 = Â¥372

New value of shares after the second year = Value after the first year - Decrease
= Â¥1488 - Â¥372
= Â¥1116

**Step 4: Calculate the value of Ananya's shares after the third year**

The stock price increases by 25% in the third year. To find the new value of the shares, we need to calculate 25% of the value after the second year and add it to the value after the second year.

25% of Â¥1116 = 0.25 Ã— Â¥1116 = Â¥279

New value of shares after the third year = Value after the second year + Increase
= Â¥1116 + Â¥279
= Â¥1395

**Step 5: Calculate the profit Ananya made**

To find the profit Ananya made, we need to subtract the initial value from the final value.

Profit = Final value - Initial value
= Â¥1395 - Â¥960
= Â¥435

Therefore, Ananya made a profit of Â¥435 by the end of the third year.",435.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Ananya buys 12 shares of the stock for Â¥80 each.
The initial cost is 12 * 80 = 960 yen.

The stock price increases by 55% in the first year.
First, we need to find 55% of 80.
55% of 80 is 0.55 * 80 = 44.
So, the price increases to 80 + 44 = 124 yen.

The number of shares remains the same, 12.
So, the value of Ananya's shares is 12 * 124 = 1490 yen.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%.
25% of 124 is 0.25 * 124 = 31.
So, the price decreases to 124 - 31 = 93 yen.

The number of shares remains the same, 12.
So, the value of Ananya's shares is 12 * 93 = 1116 yen.

In the third year, the stock price increases by 25%.
25% of 93 is 0.25 * 93 = 23.25.
So, the price increases to 93 + 23.25 = 116.25 yen.

The number of shares remains the same, 12.
So, the value of Ananya's shares is 12 * 116.25 = 1395 yen.

To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the final value.
The profit is 1395 - 960 = 435 yen.

How many friends can she invite?",2.0,"To find out how many friends Emma can invite, we need to subtract the total costs of transportation, laser tag, pinball tokens, and roller coaster rides from her budget.

1. Calculate the cost of laser tag: 
Number of friends and Emma = x + 1
Cost of laser tag per person = â‚¬6
Total cost of laser tag = (x + 1) * 6
Total cost of laser tag = 6x + 6

2. Calculate the cost of roller coaster rides: 
Cost of roller coaster per ride = â‚¬10
Emma wants to ride the roller coaster 3 times
Cost of roller coaster for Emma = 10 * 3 = â‚¬30
x friends will also ride the roller coaster 3 times
Cost of roller coaster for friends = 10 * 3 * x = 30x
Total cost of roller coaster = Cost for Emma + Cost for friends
Total cost of roller coaster = 30 + 30x

3. Calculate the total cost for pinball tokens:
Cost of pinball tokens per person = â‚¬4
Total cost of pinball tokens = (x + 1) * 4
Total cost of pinball tokens = 4x + 4

4. Calculate the total cost of the bus for transportation:
Cost of the bus = â‚¬60

5. Now, let's add up all the costs:

Total cost = 6x + 6 + 30x + 30 + 4x + 4 + 60
Total cost = 40x + 100

6. Emma's budget is â‚¬180, so we'll set up the equation:

40x = 80
x = 80 / 40

Emma's dad has budgeted â‚¬180 for the birthday party.

Emma wants to play laser tag, which costs â‚¬6 per round.
She wants to have â‚¬4 in pinball tokens.
She wants to ride the roller coaster three times, which costs â‚¬10 per ride.
The total cost for these activities is 6 + 4 + (10 * 3) = 6 + 4 + 30 = 40.

Emma also needs to rent a bus for the day, which costs â‚¬60.

So, the total cost for the activities and the bus is 40 + 60 = 100.

Emma has a budget of â‚¬180, so she can spend up to â‚¬180.
The total cost for the activities and the bus is â‚¬100, which is less than the budget.
However, we need to find out how many friends Emma can invite.

Let's assume the cost per friend is x.
The cost for Emma herself is not included in the budget, so we only need to consider the cost for her friends.
The total cost for the friends is 100, and there are x friends.
So, the equation is x * (number of friends) = 100.

However, we also need to consider the cost of the bus, which is â‚¬60.

To find the number of friends, we need to divide the total cost by the cost per friend.
x = 120 / (number of friends).

However, we are looking for the number of friends, not the cost per friend.
Let's rearrange the equation: number of friends = 120 / x.

We still need to find the value of x.
Let's go back to the original equation: x * (number of friends) = 100.
We know that the total cost for the activities and the bus is â‚¬100.
The cost for the activities is â‚¬40, and the cost for the bus is â‚¬60.
The cost per friend is the total cost minus the cost for the activities and the bus.

First, let's subtract the absent students from the total number of students to find the number of students present:

Q: There are 80 fourth-graders at Oak Ridge School. 34 of them are girls. On Thursday, 8 fourth-grade girls and 7 fourth-grade boys were absent. On Thursday, what percentage of the present fourth-grade students were boys?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of students present on Thursday.
There are 80 fourth-graders in total.
8 girls and 7 boys were absent, so the number of absent students is 8 + 7 = 15.
The number of present students is 80 - 15 = 65.

Next, we need to find the number of boys present on Thursday.
There are 34 girls in total.
8 girls were absent, so the number of present girls is 34 - 8 = 26.
The number of boys in total is 80 - 34 = 46.
7 boys were absent, so the number of present boys is 46 - 7 = 39.

Now, we need to find the percentage of present boys.
The number of present boys is 39.
The total number of present students is 65.
To find the percentage, we divide the number of present boys by the total number of present students and multiply by 100:

How much does he earn in a year after paying 25% in taxes?,1296.0,"To calculate the carpenter's yearly income, we need to first find out how much he earns in a month, and then multiply it by 12.

1. Calculate the number of days the carpenter works in a month: 
   The carpenter works 2 weeks every month. There are 7 days in a week. 
   So, the carpenter works 2 * 7 = 14 days every month.

2. Since he also works 6 additional days a week, but only 2 weeks, we'll multiply the 6 by 1 and add it to the 14 to get the total days he works per month.
   14 (from weeks) + 6 (additional days) = 20 days per month.

3. Now we'll find out his monthly income. The carpenter gets paid Â¥12 per day.
   Monthly income = 12 * 20 = Â¥240

4. Since there are 12 months in a year, we'll multiply the monthly income by 12.
   Yearly income = 240 * 12 = Â¥2880

5. The carpenter pays 25% in taxes, which means 75% of his income is left after paying taxes.
   To find the amount of taxes, we'll multiply the yearly income by 0.25 (25%).
   Taxes = 2880 * 0.25 = Â¥720

6. Now, we subtract the taxes from the yearly income to find the net income.
   Net income = Yearly income - Taxes
             = 2880 - 720

So, Jamal slew 270 giants.

3. Luis slew four times as many giants as Jamal. To find out how many giants Luis slew, we need to calculate four times 270.

Four times 270 = 4 Ã— 270

If the length of his room is 16 feet longer that its width, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?",68.0,"To solve this problem, we need to first find the width and length of the room. Let's call the width ""w"" and the length ""l"". We know that the area of the room is 225 square feet, so we can write an equation:

w Ã— l = 225

We also know that the length of the room is 16 feet longer than its width, so we can write another equation:

l = w + 16

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

w Ã— (w + 16) = 225

Expanding the left-hand side of the equation, we get:

w^2 + 16w = 225

Rearranging the equation to form a quadratic equation, we get:

w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0

Now we can factor the quadratic equation:

(w + 25)(w - 9) = 0

This tells us that either (w + 25) = 0 or (w - 9) = 0.

Solving for w, we get:

w + 25 = 0 --> w = -25 (not possible, since width cannot be negative)

w - 9 = 0 --> w = 9

So the width of the room is 9 feet.

Now we can find the length of the room by substituting w into the equation l = w + 16:

l = 9 + 16
l = 25

So the length of the room is 25 feet.

Now we can find the perimeter of the room by using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 Ã— (length + width)

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 68 feet.",68.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Kai's office is a rectangle with an unknown width (W) and a length (L) that is 16 feet longer than the width, so L = W + 16.

We know that the area of the rectangle is 225 square feet, which is given by the formula: Area = Length * Width.

We can write this as an equation: W * (W + 16) = 225.

To find the width, we can expand the equation: W^2 + 16W = 225.

Then, rearrange it to the form of a quadratic equation: W^2 + 16W - 225 = 0.

Now, we need to solve this quadratic equation to find the value of W. We can use the quadratic formula: W = (-b Â± âˆš(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 1, b = 16, and c = -225.

W = (-16 Â± âˆš(16^2 - 4(1)(-225))) / 2(1)
W = (-16 Â± âˆš(256 + 900)) / 2
W = (-16 Â± âˆš1156) / 2
W = (-16 Â± 34) / 2

Now we have two solutions for W:
W = (-16 + 34) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
W = (-16 - 34) / 2 = -50 / 2 = -25 (we discard this negative solution since width cannot be negative)

So, the width is 9 feet. Since the length is 16 feet longer than the width, the length is W + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25 feet.

Now that we know the width and the length, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width).
Perimeter = 2 * (25 + 9)
Perimeter = 2 * 34
Perimeter = 68

On average, how many cards per color are there?",54.0,"To find the average number of cards per color, we need to find the total number of cards of each color and then divide by the number of colors.

Let's break down the information:

1. Pink cards: 30
2. Red cards: 70% more than pink cards
   To find 70% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.7: 30 * 0.7 = 21

What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remaining remoras?,20.0,"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that is the combined length of the remaining remoras, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the total length of the remoras that are attached to the shark.
2. Calculate the number of remoras that remain after 1/5 of them go away.
3. Find the combined length of the remaining remoras.
4. Divide the combined length of the remaining remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

Step 1: Find the total length of the remoras that are attached to the shark.

There are 15 remoras, each 15 inches long. So, the total length of the remoras is:
15 remoras * 15 inches/remora = 225 inches

Step 2: Calculate the number of remoras that remain after 1/5 of them go away.

1/5 of the remoras go away, so the number of remoras that remain is:
15 remoras - (1/5 * 15 remoras) = 15 remoras - 3 remoras = 12 remoras

Step 3: Find the combined length of the remaining remoras.

The remaining remoras are 12 in number, each 15 inches long. So, the combined length of the remaining remoras is:
12 remoras * 15 inches/remora = 180 inches

Step 4: Divide the combined length of the remaining remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

The length of the shark is 75 feet, which is equal to 900 inches. So, the percentage of the shark's body length that is the combined length of the remaining remoras is:

First, we need to find the combined length of the remoras initially attached to the shark.
15 remoras, each 15 inches long, so the combined length is 15 * 15 = 225 inches.

Now, we need to convert the shark's length to inches to make it comparable with the combined length of the remoras.
1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so the shark's length is 75 * 12 = 900 inches.

Now, we know that 1/5 of the remoras go away. So, the number of remoras left is 15 - (1/5 * 15) = 15 - 3 = 12.

The combined length of the remaining remoras is 12 * 15 = 180 inches.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that is the combined length of the remaining remoras.
The percentage is (combined length of remaining remoras / shark's length) * 100

Yuki has 2/4 as many tubes of pink paint as Sanjay. Since Sanjay has 10 tubes of pink paint, we can calculate Yuki's tubes as follows:

Yuki's pink tubes = (2/4) Ã— Sanjay's pink tubes
= (2/4) Ã— 10
= 5

**Step 2: Calculate the number of tubes of blue paint Yuki has**

Yuki has thrice as many tubes of blue paint as Sanjay. Since Sanjay has 3 tubes of blue paint, we can calculate Yuki's tubes as follows:

Yuki's blue tubes = 3 Ã— Sanjay's blue tubes
= 3 Ã— 3
= 9

**Step 3: Calculate the combined number of pink tubes that Sanjay and Yuki have**

Sanjay has 10 tubes of pink paint, and Yuki has 5 tubes of pink paint. The combined number of pink tubes is:

Combined pink tubes = Sanjay's pink tubes + Yuki's pink tubes

**Step 4: Calculate the number of tubes of black paint Andre has**

Andre has six times as many tubes of black paint as the combined number of pink tubes that Sanjay and Yuki have. We calculated the combined number of pink tubes in Step 3:

Combined pink tubes = 15

Andre's black tubes = 6 Ã— Combined pink tubes
= 6 Ã— 15

**Step 5: Calculate the combined number of blue tubes that Sanjay and Yuki have**

Sanjay has 3 tubes of blue paint, and Yuki has 9 tubes of blue paint. The combined number of blue tubes is:

Andre has 6 fewer tubes of white paint than the combined number of blue tubes that Sanjay and Yuki have. We calculated the combined number of blue tubes in Step 5:

Combined blue tubes = 12

Andre's white tubes = Combined blue tubes - 6
= 12 - 6
= 6

**Step 7: Calculate the total number of tubes of paint Andre has**

Andre has 90 tubes of black paint and 6 tubes of white paint. The total number of tubes of paint Andre has is:

Total tubes = Andre's black tubes + Andre's white tubes

130 + 13 + 143 + 286 = 472

Therefore, Kayla has written a total of 472 letters.",472.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Step 1: Kayla writes the alphabet 5 times.
The alphabet has 26 letters.
So, the number of letters she writes in the first step is 5 * 26 = 130.
She writes this for the first time.

Step 2: Kayla writes 3/6 of the alphabet, which is half of it, once.
Half of 26 letters is 26 / 2 = 13.
So, the number of letters she writes in the second step is 13.
She writes this for the second time.

Step 3: Kayla re-writes everything she has already written.
She has written 130 + 13 = 143 letters so far.
So, the number of letters she writes in the third step is 143.
She writes this for the third time.

Step 4: Kayla has written 143 letters, and then she re-writes everything she has already written.
She re-writes 143 letters again.
However, the instructions say she re-writes everything she has written so far, which means she is re-writing everything she has written up to this point. 
She has written 143 letters so far. However, the problem becomes slightly ambiguous here as it says re-write ""everything she has written so far."" We will assume that the first three steps have already been counted.

Step 5: Kayla re-writes everything she has written so far and this time the interpretation is clear that it will be the last time she re-writes for this round and the final re-write.  (The first three steps have been counted already)

So, she re-writes everything that has been written in the first three steps and this is her last re-write.

Since we have already written the letter count for the first three steps (130 + 13 + 143 = 286), the answer is 286.

How many letters has Kayla written in total?

A: Let's think step by step.

Kayla writes the alphabet in full five times.
Since the alphabet has 26 letters, writing it in full five times means she writes 5 * 26 = 130 letters.

She then writes three-sixths of the alphabet once.
Three-sixths of the alphabet is (3/6) * 26 = 13 letters.

So, the total number of letters she has written so far is 130 + 13 = 143 letters.

When the water is warm, Carlos swims a kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times as long. How much longer does Carlos take to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day than 9 kilometers on a cold day?",272.0,"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Carlos to swim 1 kilometer on a warm day, and then how long it takes him to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day and 9 kilometers on a cold day.

**Step 1: Find the time it takes Carlos to swim 1 kilometer on a warm day**

When the water is warm, Carlos swims a kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times as long as it takes him to swim a kilometer on a cold day. Since it takes him 11 minutes to swim a kilometer on a cold day, we multiply 11 by 4 and add 9:

4 Ã— 11 = 44
44 + 9 = 53

So, it takes Carlos 53 minutes to swim 1 kilometer on a warm day.

**Step 2: Find the time it takes Carlos to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day**

Since it takes Carlos 53 minutes to swim 1 kilometer on a warm day, we multiply 53 by 7:

53 Ã— 7 = 371

So, it takes Carlos 371 minutes to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day.

**Step 3: Find the time it takes Carlos to swim 9 kilometers on a cold day**

Since it takes Carlos 11 minutes to swim 1 kilometer on a cold day, we multiply 11 by 9:

11 Ã— 9 = 99

So, it takes Carlos 99 minutes to swim 9 kilometers on a cold day.

**Step 4: Find the difference in time**

To find out how much longer it takes Carlos to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day than 9 kilometers on a cold day, we subtract the time it takes him to swim 9 kilometers on a cold day from the time it takes him to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day:

371 - 99 = 272

Therefore, Carlos takes 272 minutes longer to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day than 9 kilometers on a cold day.",9.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Carlos swims a kilometer in 11 minutes when the water is cold.

When the water is warm, Carlos swims a kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times as long as when the water is cold. Four times the time it takes in cold water is 4 * 11 = 44 minutes. 

So, when it's warm, Carlos swims a kilometer in 44 + 9 = 53 minutes.

To find out how much longer Carlos takes to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day than 9 kilometers on a cold day, we need to calculate the time for each scenario and then find the difference.

On a cold day, it takes 11 minutes to swim a kilometer. So, it takes 11 * 9 = 99 minutes to swim 9 kilometers.

On a warm day, it takes 53 minutes to swim a kilometer. So, it takes 53 * 7 = 371 minutes to swim 7 kilometers.

The difference in time is 371 - 99 = 272 minutes.

1. The child has 13 marbles.
2. His friend has 2 fewer marbles than two times what he has. Let's call the number of marbles the child has ""x"". Then, two times what he has is 2x.
3. Two times what he has minus 2 is 2x - 2.
4. Since the child has 13 marbles, his friend has 2x - 2 marbles.
5. To find the number of marbles the friend has, we need to know the value of x. However, we can express the number of marbles the friend has in terms of x.
6. The total number of marbles they have together is the sum of the marbles the child has and the marbles the friend has: 13 + (2x - 2).
7. To find the total number of marbles, we need to know the value of x. However, we can simplify the expression: 13 + 2x - 2 = 11 + 2x.
8. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to find the value of x. However, we can express the total number of marbles in terms of x.

But, let's try to find the value of x. We know that the friend has 2 fewer marbles than two times what the child has. Since the child has 13 marbles, two times what he has is 2(13) = 26. The friend has 2 fewer marbles than 26, so the friend has 26 - 2 = 24 marbles.

Nadia's daily production = 9 Ã— 8 = 72 customers

Uma operates at the same speed as the average of Emma and Nadia. To find Uma's daily production, we need to find the average of Emma's and Nadia's daily production:
Average of Emma and Nadia = (8 + 72) / 2 = 40 customers
Uma's daily production = 40 customers

40% of â‚£10 = 0.4 x â‚£10 = â‚£4
Cost of more expensive brand = â‚£10 + â‚£4 = â‚£14 per kilogram

To find the percentage of green spools, divide the total number of green spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100:
(44 Ã· 550) Ã— 100 = 8%

Therefore, 8% of Emma's spools are green.",8.0,1,"Let's think step by step to find the percentage of green spools Emma has.

Emma has 4 types of spools: light green, dark green, light black, and dark black.

1. She has 17 light green spools.
2. She has 27 dark green spools.
3. So, the total number of green spools is 17 + 27 = 44.

Next, we are told that she has ten times as many magenta spools as green spools. 
The total number of green spools is 44.

4. To find the total number of magenta spools, we multiply the number of green spools by 10.
   So, the number of magenta spools is 44 * 10 = 440.

Now, we have the total number of all spools (green and magenta).
5. The total number of spools is the sum of green spools and magenta spools.
   Total spools = 44 (green) + 440 (magenta) = 484.

We need to find the percentage of green spools.
6. To find the percentage, we divide the number of green spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100.
   The number of green spools is 44.
   The total number of spools is 484.
   So, the percentage of green spools is (44 / 484) * 100 = 9.09 (rounded to two decimal places).

The answer is 9.09%.",9.09,0,"Q: Emma has 17 light green spools of thread, 27 dark green spools of thread, 49 light black spools of thread, and 17 dark black spools of thread. She also has ten times as many magenta spools as green spools. What percent of her spools are green?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of green spools. Emma has 17 light green spools and 27 dark green spools.
So, the total number of green spools is 17 + 27 = 44.

Next, we need to find the total number of magenta spools. Emma has ten times as many magenta spools as green spools.
So, the total number of magenta spools is 10 * 44 = 440.

Now, we need to find the total number of spools. Emma has 44 green spools, 440 magenta spools, 49 light black spools, and 17 dark black spools.
So, the total number of spools is 44 + 440 + 49 + 17 = 550.

To find the percentage of green spools, we need to divide the number of green spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100.
So, the percentage of green spools is (44 / 550) * 100 = 8.0%.

However, I made a mistake earlier. Let's recalculate the percentage.
The total number of green spools is 44.
The total number of spools is 550.
So, the percentage of green spools is (44 / 550) * 100 = 8.0%.

Wait, I made another mistake! I should have calculated the percentage as a decimal and then converted it to a percentage.
The total number of green spools is 44.
The total number of spools is 550.
So, the decimal percentage of green spools is 44 / 550 = 0.08.
To convert it to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.08 * 100 = 8.0%.

However, I should have expressed the answer as a percentage in the format ""x.x%"". Let me correct that.

He can make giant cubes that use 12 grams per cube, medium cubes that use 11 grams, small cubes that use 1/4 of gram, and tiny cubes that are half the size of small cubes. If he makes 8 giant cubes, 24 small cubes, 15 medium cubes, and eight tiny cubes, how many grams of water does he have left?",76.0,"To find out how many grams of water Oliver has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the total amount of water available.

1. Giant cubes: 
   Oliver makes 8 giant cubes that use 12 grams each. 
   Total grams used for giant cubes: 8 * 12 = 96 grams

2. Small cubes: 
   Oliver makes 24 small cubes that use 1/4 gram each. 
   First, we need to convert 1/4 gram into decimal form: 1/4 = 0.25
   Total grams used for small cubes: 24 * 0.25 = 6 grams

3. Tiny cubes: 
   Oliver makes 8 tiny cubes, and tiny cubes are half the size of small cubes. 
   Since small cubes use 0.25 grams, tiny cubes use 0.25 / 2 = 0.125 grams each.
   Total grams used for tiny cubes: 8 * 0.125 = 1 gram

4. Medium cubes: 
   Oliver makes 15 medium cubes that use 11 grams each. 
   Total grams used for medium cubes: 15 * 11 = 165 grams

Now, we add up the total grams used for each type of cube: 
96 + 6 + 1 + 165 = 268 grams

Oliver started with 344 grams of water and used 268 grams. 
To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total amount used from the original amount:
344 - 268 = 76 grams

Oliver has 76 grams of water left.",76.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Oliver starts with 344 grams of water.

He makes 8 giant cubes that use 12 grams per cube.
So, the total amount of water used for giant cubes is 8 * 12 = 96 grams.

He makes 24 small cubes that use 1/4 gram per cube.
Since 1/4 gram is the same as 0.25 grams, the total amount of water used for small cubes is 24 * 0.25 = 6 grams.

He makes 15 medium cubes that use 11 grams per cube.
So, the total amount of water used for medium cubes is 15 * 11 = 165 grams.

He makes 8 tiny cubes that are half the size of small cubes.
Since small cubes use 0.25 grams, tiny cubes use 0.25 / 2 = 0.125 grams per cube.
The total amount of water used for tiny cubes is 8 * 0.125 = 1 gram.

So, the total amount of water used is 96 + 6 + 165 + 1 = 268 grams.

To find out how many grams of water Oliver has left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water.
So, the amount of water left is 344 - 268 = 76 grams.

How many like to paint if the number that like to read is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing hurling?",99.0,"To find the number of students who like to paint, we need to first find the number of students who like to read. 

Let's start by finding the number of students who like to read. We are told that the number of students who like to read is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing hurling. 

Number of students who like to play hurling = 6
Number of students who like to read = 4 * 6 - 3
= 24 - 3
= 21

Now, we know that the total number of students who like to bake, play hurling, paint, or read is 160. 

Number of students who like to bake = 34
Number of students who like to play hurling = 6
Number of students who like to read = 21

Total number of students who like to bake, play hurling, or read = 34 + 6 + 21
= 61

Now, we can find the number of students who like to paint by subtracting the total number of students who like to bake, play hurling, or read from the total number of students.

Number of students who like to paint = Total number of students - Total number of students who like to bake, play hurling, or read
= 160 - 61
= 99

Therefore, 99 students like to paint.",99.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we know that 34 students like to bake and 6 like to play hurling. We need to find out how many like to paint.

We are also given that the number of students who like to read is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing hurling. Let's call the number of students who like to play hurling ""h"". Then, the number of students who like to read is 4h - 3.

We know that the total number of students is 160. We can set up an equation to represent this:

34 (baking) + 6 (hurling) + (4h - 3) (reading) + x (painting) = 160

We need to find the value of x, which is the number of students who like to paint.

First, let's simplify the equation by combining the constants:

34 + 6 + (4h - 3) + x = 160

This simplifies to:

41 + 4h - 3 + x = 160

Combine the constants:

38 + 4h + x = 160

Now, let's isolate the term with the variable (4h) by subtracting 38 from both sides:

4h + x = 122

We are not given a direct value for x, but we are given a relationship between the number of students who like to read and the number who like to play hurling. We can use this relationship to find the value of h.

We know that the number of students who like to read is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing hurling, so we can write an equation:

4h - 3 = number of students who like to read

We are also given that the number of students who like to read is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing hurling. Let's call the number of students who like to read ""r"". Then, we can write:

r = 4h - 3

We know that the total number of students is 160, and we have already accounted for 34 + 6 = 40 students who like to bake or play hurling. The remaining students like to read or paint. We can set up an equation to represent this:

40 + r + x = 160

Substitute the expression for r:

40 + (4h - 3) + x = 160

Simplify the equation:

40 + 4h - 3 + x = 160

Combine the constants:

37 + 4h + x = 160

Now, let's isolate the term with the variable (4h) by subtracting 37 from both sides:

4h + x = 123

We now have two equations:

4h + x = 122
4h + x = 123

These two equations are identical, which means that we have an infinite number of solutions. However, we can still find the value of h by using the fact that the number of students who like to read is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing hurling.

We can write an equation based on this relationship:

r = 4h - 3

We know that the number of students who like to read is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing hurling. We can also write an equation based on the fact that the total number of students is 160:

40 + r + x = 160

Substitute the expression for r:

40 + (4h - 3) + x = 160

Simplify the equation:

40 + 4h - 3 + x = 160

Combine the constants:

37 + 4h + x = 160

Now, let's isolate the term with the variable (4h) by subtracting 37 from both sides:

4h + x = 123

We can now solve for h by substituting the expression for x from the first equation (4h + x = 122) into the second equation (4h + x = 123):

4h + (122 - 4h) = 123

Simplify the equation:

4h + 122 - 4h = 123

122 = 123

This is a contradiction, which means that our initial assumption that the number of students who like to paint is a whole number is incorrect.

Now, let's isolate the term with the variable (4h) by subtracting 37 from both sides:

4h + x = 123

We can now solve for h by substituting the expression for x from the first equation (4h + x = 122) into the second equation (4h + x = 123):

Simplify the equation:

4h + 122 - 4h = 123

Combine like terms:

122 = 123

This is a contradiction, which means that our initial assumption that the number of students who like to paint is a whole number is incorrect.

A group of 160 students has various hobbies. 
34 like to bake.
6 like to play hurling.
The rest like to either paint or read.

Let's start by finding the total number of students who like to play hurling or paint. 
We know that 34 like to bake and 6 like to play hurling. 
So, the number of students who like to play hurling or paint is 160 - (34 + 6) = 160 - 40 = 120.

We are also given that the number of students who like to read is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing hurling. 
Let's represent the number of students who like to play hurling as H. 
Then, the number of students who like to read is 4H - 3.

We know that the total number of students who like to play hurling or paint is 120. 
So, the number of students who like to paint is 120 - (6) = 114.

We also know that the number of students who like to read is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing hurling. 
So, 4H - 3 = 114.

Now, let's solve for H. 
4H - 3 = 114
4H = 114 + 3
4H = 117
H = 117 / 4
H = 29.25

Since H represents the number of students who like to play hurling, it must be a whole number. 
However, we can see that 29.25 is not a whole number. 
This means that our previous equation 4H - 3 = 114 is not correct.

Let's re-examine the problem. 
We know that the number of students who like to read is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing hurling. 
So, the number of students who like to read is 4H - 3.

4H + 3 = 114
4H = 111
H = 111 / 4
H = 27.75

Since H represents the number of students who like to play hurling, it must be a whole number.

He has applied for help from the youth club, which has decided to cover a tenth of the cost of the music festival. His friends have also chipped in and will cover 1/2 of the music festival. How much money is Yuki missing if he has Â¥15 and the music festival costs Â¥490?",181.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The youth club will cover a tenth of the cost of the music festival. To find out how much they will cover, we need to multiply the total cost by 1/10:

Â¥490 Ã— 1/10 = Â¥49

So, the youth club will cover Â¥49.

2. Yuki's friends will cover 1/2 of the music festival. To find out how much they will cover, we need to multiply the total cost by 1/2:

Â¥490 Ã— 1/2 = Â¥245

So, Yuki's friends will cover Â¥245.

3. Now, let's add up the amount covered by the youth club and Yuki's friends:

Â¥49 + Â¥245 = Â¥294

This is the total amount covered by the youth club and Yuki's friends.

4. To find out how much money Yuki is missing, we need to subtract the total amount covered from the total cost of the music festival:

Â¥490 - Â¥294 = Â¥196

So, Yuki is missing Â¥196.

However, we also need to consider the Â¥15 that Yuki has. Since this is a small amount, we can ignore it for now and focus on the main question.

The final answer is: Â¥196",196.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Yuki needs Â¥490 for the music festival.
He has Â¥15, which is not enough to cover the cost.
The youth club will cover a tenth of the cost, which is Â¥490 / 10 = Â¥49.
His friends will cover 1/2 of the cost, which is Â¥490 / 2 = Â¥245.
So, the total amount of money Yuki has received is Â¥49 + Â¥245 = Â¥294.
Since Yuki needs Â¥490, he is missing Â¥490 - Â¥294 = Â¥196.

How much money does he have left, if he receives a 25% discount on the puzzle and a 20% on the pencil?",328.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Noah has initially**

Noah has 7 Â¥50 bills, so he has a total of:
7 x Â¥50 = Â¥350

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the puzzles**

Noah buys 2 puzzles for Â¥4 each, so the total cost of the puzzles is:
2 x Â¥4 = Â¥8

**Step 3: Calculate the discount on the puzzles**

Noah receives a 25% discount on the puzzles, so the discount amount is:
25% of Â¥8 = 0.25 x Â¥8 = Â¥2

The discounted price of the puzzles is:
Â¥8 - Â¥2 = Â¥6

**Step 4: Calculate the cost of the pencils**

Noah buys 4 packs of pencils for Â¥5 each, so the total cost of the pencils is:

**Step 7: Calculate the amount of money Noah has left**

Noah had Â¥350 initially and spent Â¥22 on puzzles and pencils, so he has:
Â¥350 - Â¥22 = Â¥328

The final answer is: Â¥328",328.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Noah starts with 7 Â¥50 bills.
The total amount of money Noah has initially is 7 * 50 = 350 Â¥.
He buys 2 puzzles for Â¥4 each.
The total cost of the puzzles is 2 * 4 = 8 Â¥.
Since he receives a 25% discount on the puzzle, the discount amount is 8 * 0.25 = 2 Â¥.
So, the actual amount he pays for the puzzle is 8 - 2 = 6 Â¥.
He also buys 4 packs of pencils for Â¥5 each.
The total cost of the pencils is 4 * 5 = 20 Â¥.
Since he receives a 20% discount on the pencils, the discount amount is 20 * 0.20 = 4 Â¥.
So, the actual amount he pays for the pencils is 20 - 4 = 16 Â¥.
The total amount he paid for the puzzles and pencils is 6 + 16 = 22 Â¥.
So, the amount of money Noah has left is 350 - 22 = 328 Â¥.

Day 1:
Initially, 27 people are infected.
Each infected person infects 3 others, so the total number of new infections on Day 1 is 27 * 3 = 81.
The total number of people infected on Day 1 is 27 (initially infected) + 81 (new infections) = 108.

Day 2:
The 108 people infected on Day 1 each infect 3 others, so the total number of new infections on Day 2 is 108 * 3 = 324.
The total number of people infected on Day 2 is 108 (infected on Day 1) + 324 (new infections) = 432.

1. There are 6 students playing table tennis.
2. Twice that number playing basketball means 2 x 6 = 12 students are playing basketball.

Therefore, there are 315 students in total.",315.0,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the number of students playing basketball. Since there are twice as many students playing basketball as there are playing table tennis, and there are 6 students playing table tennis, we can calculate the number of students playing basketball as follows:

Let's think step by step.
There are 6 students playing table tennis.
Twice that number are playing basketball.
So, the number of students playing basketball is 6 * 2 = 12.

Next, we need to find the total number of students playing badminton. We are given that there are 29 boys and 16 girls playing badminton, so we can calculate the total number of students playing badminton as follows:

Let's think step by step.
There are 29 boys playing badminton.
There are 16 girls playing badminton.
So, the total number of students playing badminton is 29 + 16 = 45.

Now, we need to find the number of students playing football. We are given that the number of students playing football is four times the combined number of students who play other sports. We have already calculated the number of students playing basketball (12) and badminton (45), so we can calculate the combined number of students playing other sports as follows:

Let's think step by step.
There are 12 students playing basketball.
There are 45 students playing badminton.
So, the combined number of students playing other sports is 12 + 45 = 57.

Since the number of students playing football is four times the combined number of students playing other sports, we can calculate the number of students playing football as follows:

Let's think step by step.
The combined number of students playing other sports is 57.
Four times that number are playing football.
So, the number of students playing football is 57 * 4 = 228.

Finally, we can calculate the total number of students by adding the number of students playing each sport:

Let's think step by step.
There are 6 students playing table tennis.
There are 12 students playing basketball.
There are 45 students playing badminton.
There are 228 students playing football.
So, the total number of students is 6 + 12 + 45 + 228 = 291.

The answer is 291.",291.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

There are 6 students playing table tennis.
Twice that number are playing basketball, so 2 * 6 = 12 students are playing basketball.

There are 29 boys and 16 girls playing badminton, so the total number of students playing badminton is 29 + 16 = 45.

The number of students playing football is four times the combined number of students who play other sports, so it is 4 * (18 + 45) = 4 * 63 = 252.

To find the total number of students, we add the number of students playing each sport: 18 + 45 + 252 = 315.

We know that each student only participates in one sport. This means that the total number of students is the sum of the number of students playing each sport.

However, we also know that the number of students playing football is four times the combined number of students who play other sports. This means that the number of students playing football is 4 times the sum of the number of students playing table tennis and basketball, and the number of students playing badminton.

First, we need to find the total number of blocks and stuffed animals combined.
The total number of blocks and stuffed animals is 31 + 6 = 37.
Since the number of action figures is twice the number of blocks and stuffed animals combined, the number of action figures is 2 * 37 = 74.
- The crayon box has 12 different colors of crayon.
- The tower of stacking rings has 33 multicolored rings on it.

Now, let's add up the number of toys Chen had before buying the bouncy balls:
31 (blocks) + 6 (stuffed animals) + 74 (action figures) + 12 (crayons) + 33 (stacking rings) = 156

Chen recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her nephew up to 196.
So, the number of bouncy balls is 196 - 156 = 40.

Each cow eats as much as a goat and alpaca eat combined. If there are 21 goats, 7 alpacas, and 21 cows, how many kilograms of grain does Alejandro need?",798.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Each goat needs 9 kilograms of grain.
2. Each alpaca needs 3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs. 
   To find out how much an alpaca needs, we need to calculate twice the amount each goat needs, which is 9 x 2 = 18. Then, we subtract 3 from that amount: 18 - 3 = 15. So, each alpaca needs 15 kilograms of grain.
3. Each cow eats as much as a goat and an alpaca eat combined. 
   To find out how much a cow eats, we need to add the amount each goat and alpaca eats: 9 + 15 = 24. So, each cow eats 24 kilograms of grain.
4. Now, let's calculate the total amount of grain needed for each type of animal:
   - Goats: 21 goats x 9 kilograms/goat = 189 kilograms
   - Alpacas: 7 alpacas x 15 kilograms/alpaca = 105 kilograms
   - Cows: 21 cows x 24 kilograms/cow = 504 kilograms

First, we need to find out how much grain each alpaca needs. We know that each goat needs 9 kilograms, and each alpaca needs 3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs.

So, twice the amount each goat needs is 2 * 9 = 18 kilograms.
Three kilograms less than that is 18 - 3 = 15 kilograms.

Now, we know that each cow eats as much as a goat and an alpaca eat combined. So, the amount each cow needs is 9 + 15 = 24 kilograms.

We have 21 goats, each needing 9 kilograms, so the total amount of grain for goats is 21 * 9 = 189 kilograms.

We have 7 alpacas, each needing 15 kilograms, so the total amount of grain for alpacas is 7 * 15 = 105 kilograms.

We have 21 cows, each needing 24 kilograms, so the total amount of grain for cows is 21 * 24 = 504 kilograms.

1. Calculate the number of occupied beds:
   The hospital has 1/8 of its beds occupied. To find the number of occupied beds, we multiply the total capacity by 1/8:
   Occupied beds = 800 * (1/8) = 800 * 0.125 = 100

2. Calculate the number of beds out of service:
   One-fifth of all the beds are out of service. To find the number of beds out of service, we multiply the total capacity by 1/5:

**Wednesday:**

* Total sales for Monday and Tuesday: Cupcakes (24 + 35) + Orange pies (12 + 28) = 59 + 40 = 99 boxes

If the cupcake cost â‚º10 and the orange pie cost â‚º22, how much was Andre's average daily earning?

A: Let's think step by step.

On Monday, Andre sold 24 boxes of cupcakes and 16 fewer boxes of orange pie than on Tuesday. Since he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes on Tuesday, he must have sold 24 + 11 = 35 boxes of cupcakes on Tuesday. Therefore, on Monday, he sold 35 - 11 = 24 boxes of cupcakes and 16 fewer boxes of orange pie, which is 28 - 16 = 12 boxes of orange pie.

On Tuesday, Andre sold 35 boxes of cupcakes and 28 boxes of orange pie.

On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. So, he sold 24 + 35 = 59 boxes of cupcakes and 12 + 28 = 40 boxes of orange pie.

The total amount of money he made on Wednesday is 59 * 10 + 40 * 22 = 590 + 880 = 1470.

First, let's find the number of volleyball players:
24% of 125 students are volleyball players.
To find 24% of 125, multiply 125 by 0.24:
125 x 0.24 = 30

So, there are 30 volleyball players. Since half of the volleyball players are absent, that's:

So, the number of volleyball players is 125 * 0.24 = 30.

Next, let's find out how many students are not volleyball players.
The total number of students is 125.
The number of volleyball players is 30.
So, the number of non-volleyball players is 125 - 30 = 95.

Now, let's find out how many students are part of the robotics club or choir.
40% of the remaining students are part of the robotics club or choir.
To find 40% of 95, we multiply 95 by 0.4.

However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a â‚¬5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Mei spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",22.0,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total space Mei needs to fill**
Since Mei wants to leave 13 feet between each plant, and the plants are 3 feet wide, the total space taken by each plant including the gap is 3 + 13 = 16 feet.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of plants Mei can fit**
The flower bed is 143 feet long, and each plant takes up 16 feet (3 feet for the plant and 13 feet for the gap). To find out how many plants she can fit, we'll divide the total length of the bed by the space each plant takes up.

Total space available = 143 feet
Space per plant = 16 feet
Total number of plants = Total space available / Space per plant
= 143 / 16
= 8.9375 (we can't have a fraction of a plant, so we'll round down to 8.9375 - since we already have 8 plants, we can fit 0.9375 more plants, but since we can't have a fraction of a plant, and 8 is the closest whole number we can fit, we will leave the last bit of space at the end empty or we can fit another plant there if the space is long enough, however we will calculate that in the next step)

Let's assume we will not fit another plant at the end, but if we choose to fit one, we will fit 9 plants.

**Step 3: Decide on the optimal number of plants**
As we have 8 plants already, we can fit 8 or 9 more plants in the remaining space. If we fit 8 more plants, the total number of plants will be 16. If we fit 9 more plants, the total number of plants will be 17. Let's check which option is more cost-effective.

**Option 1: 8 more plants**
Total plants = 8 (already have) + 8 (more) = 16
Since Mei has already 8 plants, and we are buying 8 more, we will receive the discount.

**Option 2: 9 more plants**
Total plants = 8 (already have) + 9 (more) = 17

**Step 4: Calculate the cost of plants**
If Mei buys 8 more plants, she'll get a discount. The cost of 8 plants is (8 * 9) - 5 = (72 - 5) = 67â‚¬. 
If Mei buys 9 more plants, the cost will be 9 * 9 = 81â‚¬

**Step 5: Calculate the cost of the entire purchase**
If Mei buys 8 more plants, the cost will be 67â‚¬ + the cost of the 8 plants she already owns (8 * 9 = 72â‚¬). The total cost will be 67 + 72 = 139â‚¬.

If Mei buys 9 more plants, the cost will be 81â‚¬ + the cost of the 8 plants she already owns (8 * 9 = 72â‚¬). The total cost will be 81 + 72 = 153â‚¬.

Since the total length of the bed is 143 and 9 plants and gaps will take up 9*16=144 feet, we can fit 9 plants in the bed including the spaces. Therefore, we will go with the 9 plants.

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many plants Mei can fit in her flower bed. To do this, we need to find the total space required for each plant, including the space between them.

Each plant is 3 feet wide, and Mei needs to leave 13 feet between every plant. So, the total space required for each plant is 3 + 13 = 16 feet.

**Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to peel 60 clams**

Yara can peel 6 clams per minute. To find the time it takes to peel 60 clams, we can divide 60 by 6:

60 clams / 6 clams/minute = 10 minutes

**Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to saute 60 clams**

Yara can saute 20 clams in 8 minutes. To find the time it takes to saute 60 clams, we can divide 60 by 20 and then multiply by 8:

60 clams / 20 clams = 3
3 x 8 minutes = 24 minutes

However, this is not the total time it takes to saute 60 clams. We need to consider that Yara can't work in parallel, so she needs to saute the clams one by one. Since she can saute 20 clams in 8 minutes, we can divide 60 by 20 and then multiply by 8:

60 clams / 20 clams = 3
3 x 8 minutes = 24 minutes

But we can also think of it as: Yara can saute 20 clams in 8 minutes, so she can saute 60 clams in 3 sets of 20 clams. Each set takes 8 minutes, so the total time is:

3 x 8 minutes = 24 minutes

**Step 3: Add the time it takes to wash the clams**

It takes 19 minutes to wash all the clams.

**Step 4: Add the time it takes to peel and saute the clams**

We calculated that it takes 10 minutes to peel the clams and 24 minutes to saute the clams. We add these two times together:

10 minutes + 24 minutes = 34 minutes

**Step 5: Add the time it takes to wash the clams**

We add the time it takes to wash the clams to the time it takes to peel and saute the clams:

34 minutes + 19 minutes = 53 minutes

Liam's uncle was 31 years old when he first saw the comet.
Liam was 62 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

To find the age difference, we need to find Liam's age when his uncle first saw the comet. 
Since Liam was 62 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, 31 years have passed since he saw the comet for the first time.
So, when his uncle first saw the comet, Liam was 62 - 31 = 31 years old.

Now, we can calculate the age difference between Liam's uncle and Liam.
Liam's uncle's age when Liam was 31 is not relevant to the problem, but we are comparing Liam's uncle's age when he saw the comet with Liam's age when he saw the comet for the second time.

So, Liam's uncle is 62 - 31 = 31 years older than Liam was when he saw the comet for the second time, but we need to compare Liam's age when his uncle saw the comet with Liam's age when he saw the comet for the second time.
Liam's age when his uncle first saw the comet was 31, and his age when he saw the comet for the second time was 62.
Let's compare Liam's age when he saw the comet for the second time with his uncle's age when he saw the comet.
Liam was 62 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
Liam's uncle was 31 years old when he saw the comet.
So, Liam's uncle is 62 - 31 = 31 years older than Liam.

However, this is still incorrect because we are comparing Liam's age when he saw the comet for the second time with his uncle's age when he saw the comet.
The question asks how much older Liam's uncle is than Liam.
Since Liam was 31 years old when his uncle first saw the comet, we need to find the age difference between Liam's uncle and Liam when they both saw the comet.
Liam's uncle saw the comet when he was 31 years old.
Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was 62 years old.

However, Liam's uncle saw the comet when he was 31 years old.
Liam was 31 years old when his uncle saw the comet.
So, to find the age difference, we need to find how much older Liam is than his uncle's age when Liam was 31.
Liam's uncle was 31 years old when Liam was 31.
Liam's uncle is 62 - 31 = 31 years older than 31,  but that is not correct and we are comparing Liam's age when his uncle was 31 with his uncle's age when he saw the comet.
The question asks how much older Liam's uncle is than Liam.
We need to compare Liam's age when his uncle was 31 years old with Liam's uncle's age when he saw the comet.
Liam was 31 years old when his uncle first saw the comet.
Liam's uncle was 31 years old when he saw the comet.
Since Liam was 31 when his uncle saw the comet, we can't find the age difference between Liam's age when his uncle was 31 and his uncle's age when he saw the comet.

Let's rephrase the problem: 
Liam's uncle was 31 years old when he saw the comet.
Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was 62 years old.
Liam was 31 years old when his uncle first saw the comet.
Since Liam was 31 when his uncle saw the comet, Liam's age when his uncle saw the comet is not different, and we can't find the age difference.
However, the problem is worded to compare Liam's uncle's age when Liam was 31 with Liam's age when he saw the comet for the second time, which is 62.

Liam's uncle was 31 years old when Liam was 31.
Liam's uncle saw the comet when he was 31.

Liam's age when his uncle saw the comet was 31.
Liam's uncle's age when he saw the comet was 31.
However, we want to find the age difference between Liam's uncle and Liam when Liam was 62.

Let's think about it in a different way:

However, we can find the age difference between Liam's uncle and Liam when Liam was 62.
The problem states that Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet.
Liam's uncle was 31 years old when he first saw the comet.

On Thursday, he picks half the amount of what he picked in the past 3 days combined. How many bananas does Ali have?",1119.0,"To find out the total number of bananas Ali has, we need to calculate the bananas he picked each day and then add them together.

1. On Monday, Ali picked 114 bananas.
2. On Tuesday, he picked 62 bananas.
3. On Wednesday, he picked quintuple (5 times) the number of bananas he picked on Monday, which is 5 x 114 = 570 bananas.
4. So far, Ali has picked 114 + 62 + 570 = 746 bananas.

Now, let's calculate the bananas he picked in the past 3 days combined (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday):
114 + 62 + 570 = 746 bananas

On Thursday, he picked half the amount of what he picked in the past 3 days combined, which is:
746 / 2 = 373 bananas

To find the total number of bananas Ali has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Thursday to the total:
746 + 373 = 1119 bananas

Therefore, Ali has 1119 bananas.",1119.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Ali picks 114 bananas on Monday.
He picks 62 bananas on Tuesday.
So, the total number of bananas picked in the first two days is 114 + 62 = 176.

On Wednesday, he picks quintuple the number of bananas he did on Monday.
Quintuple means 5 times, so he picks 5 * 114 = 570 bananas on Wednesday.

The total number of bananas picked in the first three days is 176 + 570 = 746.

On Thursday, he picks half the amount of what he picked in the past 3 days combined.
Half of 746 is 746 / 2 = 373.

So, the total number of bananas Ali has is 746 + 373 = 1119.

First, let's find the total number of questions in each category:

- Geography: 25% of 80 questions = 0.25 * 80 = 20 questions
- Chemistry: 15% of 80 questions = 0.15 * 80 = 12 questions
- Literature: Since the rest of the questions are equally divided between literature and geometry, we subtract the geography and chemistry questions from the total: 80 - 20 - 12 = 48 questions
- Geometry: 48 / 2 = 24 questions

Now, let's find the number of questions Kimia is sure to get correct in each category:

- Geography: 5% of 20 questions = 0.05 * 20 = 1 question
- Chemistry: 25% of 12 questions = 0.25 * 12 = 3 questions
- Literature: Half of 24 questions = 24 / 2 = 12 questions

Now, let's add up the questions Kimia is sure to get correct:
1 (geography) + 3 (chemistry) + 12 (literature) + 12 (geometry) = 28

Kimia is sure to get 28 points.",28.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the number of questions in each category. 
There are 80 questions in total.

The percentage of geography questions is 25%. 
So, the number of geography questions is 25% of 80, which is 0.25 * 80 = 20.

The percentage of chemistry questions is 15%. 
So, the number of chemistry questions is 15% of 80, which is 0.15 * 80 = 12.

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between literature and geometry, the percentage of these questions is 100% - 25% - 15% = 60%. 
So, the number of these questions is 60% of 80, which is 0.60 * 80 = 48.

But since these 48 questions are divided equally between literature and geometry, we need to divide 48 by 2.
So, there are 48 / 2 = 24 literature questions and 24 geometry questions.

We know Kimia is sure to get 25% of the chemistry questions. 
So, the number of chemistry questions she is sure to get is 0.25 * 12 = 3.

She is also sure to get 5% of the geography questions. 
So, the number of geography questions she is sure to get is 0.05 * 20 = 1.

Since she is sure to get half of the literature questions, she is sure to get 24 / 2 = 12 literature questions.

Similarly, since she is sure to get half of the geometry questions, she is sure to get 24 / 2 = 12 geometry questions.

The number of points she is sure to get is the sum of the points she is sure to get in each category.
So, she is sure to get 3 (chemistry) + 1 (geography) + 12 (literature) + 12 (geometry) = 28 points.

First, let's find the pounds of ore mined per day by one miner with a bronze pickaxe and a diamond pickaxe.

1. With a basic shovel, one miner can mine 5 pounds of ore per day.
2. With a bronze pickaxe, one miner can mine twice as much as with a basic shovel, so it's 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of ore per day.
3. With a diamond pickaxe, one miner can mine 80% more than with a bronze pickaxe. To find 80% of 10 pounds, we multiply 10 by 0.8, which is 8 pounds. Then we add 10 pounds to get 18 pounds of ore per day.

First, let's find out how many pounds of ore one miner can mine in a month with a bronze pickaxe and a diamond pickaxe.

With a basic shovel, one miner can mine 5 pounds of ore per day.

With a bronze pickaxe, one miner can mine twice as much as with a basic shovel, so 2 * 5 = 10 pounds of ore per day.

With a diamond pickaxe, one miner can mine 80% more than with a bronze pickaxe. 80% of 10 pounds is 0.8 * 10 = 8 pounds. So, with a diamond pickaxe, one miner can mine 10 + 8 = 18 pounds of ore per day.

Now, let's find out how many pounds of ore one miner can mine in a month (28 days) with a bronze pickaxe and a diamond pickaxe.

With a bronze pickaxe, one miner can mine 10 pounds of ore per day. In 28 days, one miner can mine 10 * 28 = 280 pounds of ore.

With a diamond pickaxe, one miner can mine 18 pounds of ore per day. In 28 days, one miner can mine 18 * 14 = 252 pounds of ore (since the second half of the month is 14 days).

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's find out how much ore one miner can mine in a day with a bronze pickaxe and a diamond pickaxe.

One miner can mine 5 pounds of ore per day with a basic shovel.

He can mine twice as much with a bronze pickaxe, so he can mine 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of ore per day with a bronze pickaxe.

He can mine 80% more with a diamond pickaxe than with a bronze pickaxe, so he can mine 10 + (10 * 0.8) = 10 + 8 = 18 pounds of ore per day with a diamond pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore one miner can mine in a month with 28 days.

With a basic shovel, one miner can mine 5 pounds of ore per day, so in 28 days, he can mine 5 * 28 = 140 pounds of ore.

With a bronze pickaxe, one miner can mine 10 pounds of ore per day, so in 28 days, he can mine 10 * 28 = 280 pounds of ore.

With a diamond pickaxe, one miner can mine 18 pounds of ore per day, so in 28 days, he can mine 18 * 28 = 504 pounds of ore.

Since the miners use bronze pickaxes in the first half of the month and diamond pickaxes in the second half, we need to find the total amount of ore mined by one miner in 14 days with a bronze pickaxe and 14 days with a diamond pickaxe.

One miner can mine 280 pounds of ore in 14 days with a bronze pickaxe and 504 pounds of ore in 14 days with a diamond pickaxe.

So, the total amount of ore mined by one miner in 28 days is 280 + 504 = 784 pounds of ore.

Now, let's find out how much ore 11 miners can mine in a month with 28 days.

She bought a jersey for $20, a pair of swimming leggings for $14 more than the jersey cost, and a pair of cleats that were originally $36 but were on sale for three-fourths price. She had a coupon for $1 off the package of $12 athletic headbands that she also bought. Finally, she got a duffle bag for $40 but with a 50% discount, and a water bottle for $3. How much did she spend on athletic gear?",115.0,"Let's break down Sophia's purchases step by step to calculate the total amount she spent.

1. The jersey cost $20.
2. The swimming leggings cost $14 more than the jersey. 
   So, the cost of the leggings = $20 (cost of jersey) + $14 = $34.

3. The original price of the cleats was $36. They were on sale for three-fourths price. 
   To find the sale price, multiply the original price by 3/4 (or 0.75). 
   Sale price of the cleats = $36 * 0.75 = $27.

4. The athletic headbands cost $12, and Sophia had a $1 coupon for them.
   So, the cost of the headbands = $12 - $1 = $11.

5. The duffle bag cost $40, and there's a 50% discount on it.
   To find the sale price, multiply the original price by 0.5 (or 50%).
   Sale price of the duffle bag = $40 * 0.5 = $20.

6. The cost of the water bottle is $3.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: 
Cost of jersey = $20
Cost of leggings = $34
Cost of cleats = $27
Cost of headbands = $11
Cost of duffle bag = $20
Cost of water bottle = $3

Total cost = $20 + $34 + $27 + $11 + $20 + $3 = $115

So, Sophia spent $115 on athletic gear.",115.0,1,"Let's break down Sophia's purchases step by step.

The first item Sophia bought was a jersey for $20.

The second item was a pair of swimming leggings for $14 more than the jersey cost. So, the cost of the leggings is $20 + $14 = $34.

The third item was a pair of cleats that were originally $36 but were on sale for three-fourths price. Three-fourths of $36 is $36 * 3/4 = $27. So, the cost of the cleats is $27.

The fourth item was a package of athletic headbands for $12, but Sophia had a coupon for $1 off. So, the cost of the headbands is $12 - $1 = $11.

The fifth item was a duffle bag for $40, but with a 50% discount. A 50% discount means Sophia paid half the price, which is $40 * 1/2 = $20.

The sixth item was a water bottle for $3.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

How many emails does Sophia respond to in a 5-day work week?",260.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of emails that don't require any response**

16% of 150 emails don't require any response. To find 16% of 150, we multiply 150 by 0.16:

150 x 0.16 = 24

So, 24 emails don't require any response.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of emails that require a response**

Since 24 emails don't require any response, we subtract 24 from the total number of emails (150) to find the number of emails that require a response:

150 - 24 = 126

**Step 3: Calculate the number of emails Sophia can respond to**

From the remaining 126 emails, Sophia can only respond to 11 less than half of them. To find half of 126, we divide 126 by 2:

126 Ã· 2 = 63

63 - 11 = 52

So, Sophia can respond to 52 emails.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of emails Sophia responds to in a 5-day work week**

Since Sophia receives 150 emails per day, and she responds to 52 emails per day, we multiply the number of emails she responds to per day by the number of days in a work week (5):

52 x 5 = 260

From the rest, Sophia can only respond to 11 less than half of them.
Half of 126 is 126 / 2 = 63.
11 less than half is 63 - 11 = 52.

Let's say Ananya gets x yards of fence.

Since Tara gets 190 yards more than Ananya, Tara gets x + 190 yards.

Since Umar gets 30 yards more than Tara, Umar gets (x + 190) + 30 = x + 220 yards.

The total number of yards of fence is 860, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 190) + (x + 220) = 860

Combine like terms:

3x + 410 = 860

Subtract 410 from both sides:

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 150

So Ananya gets 150 yards of fence.

To find out how much is left over for Ananya, we need to subtract the total amount of fence she got from the total amount of fence:

Then Tara gets x + 190 yards of fence.
And Umar gets (x + 190) + 30 yards of fence, which is x + 220 yards of fence.

We know that the total number of yards of fence is 860.

So, we can write the equation:
x + (x + 190) + (x + 220) = 860

Combining the x terms, we get:

He then spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?",33.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of classes Santiago takes per week**

Santiago takes 3 extra classes per day, and there are 6 periods in a day. So, he takes a total of 3 extra classes per day. Since he goes to class for 4 days a week, he takes a total of:

3 extra classes/day Ã— 4 days/week = 12 extra classes/week

**Step 2: Calculate the total time spent in class per week**

Each class is 30 minutes long, so the total time spent in class per week is:

12 extra classes/week Ã— 30 minutes/class = 360 minutes/week

**Step 3: Calculate the total time spent reviewing and preparing per week**

Santiago spends 15 minutes before each class to review and prepare. Since he takes 12 extra classes per week, he spends:

12 extra classes/week Ã— 15 minutes/class = 180 minutes/week

**Step 4: Calculate the total time spent learning per week**

The total time spent learning per week is the sum of the time spent in class and the time spent reviewing and preparing:

360 minutes/week (in class) + 180 minutes/week (reviewing and preparing) = 540 minutes/week

**Step 5: Convert the total time spent learning per week to hours**

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can convert the total time spent learning per week to hours by dividing by 60:

540 minutes/week Ã· 60 = 9 hours/week

**Step 6: Calculate the extra time spent learning on Saturday and Sunday**

Santiago spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. Since he spends 540 minutes/week learning, the extra time spent learning on Saturday and Sunday is:

540 minutes/week Ã· 9 = 60 minutes/week

**Step 7: Calculate the total time spent learning per week**

The total time spent learning per week is the sum of the time spent learning during the week and the extra time spent learning on Saturday and Sunday:

9 hours/week (during the week) + 60 minutes/week (Saturday and Sunday) = 9 hours/week + 1 hour/week = 10 hours/week

Therefore, Santiago spends a total of 10 hours per week learning.",10.0,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Santiago has to take 3 extra classes, and each class is 30 minutes long. He also spends 15 minutes before each class to review the study materials and prepare. So, the total time spent in class and preparation for each class is 30 + 15 = 45 minutes.

Since he has 3 extra classes, the total time spent in class and preparation for all 3 classes is 3 * 45 = 135 minutes.

He goes to class for 4 days a week, so the total time spent in class and preparation for the week is 135 * 4 = 540 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 540 / 60 = 9 hours.

He then spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. Since he spends 540 minutes in class and preparation during the week, one-ninth of this is 540 / 9 = 60 minutes.

So, the total time spent learning each week is 9 hours (in class and preparation) + 60 minutes (extra learning time) = 9 hours 1 minute.

However, since the question asks for the total time spent learning in hours, we can convert the 1 minute to hours by dividing by 60: 1 / 60 = 0.0167 hours (approximately).

Therefore, the total time spent learning each week is approximately 9 hours + 0.0167 hours = 9 hours.

He then spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?

A: Let's think step by step.

Santiago takes 3 extra classes, each 30 minutes long, so the total time spent in class is 3 * 30 = 90 minutes.
He also spends 15 minutes before each class, so the total time spent reviewing and preparing is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.
The total time spent in class and reviewing/preparing is 90 + 45 = 135 minutes.
Since he goes to class for 4 days a week, the total time spent in class and reviewing/preparing per week is 135 * 4 = 540 minutes.
He then spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. Since there are 2 days, he spends 2 * (1/9) * 540 = 120 minutes as extra learning time.

If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?",75.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Determine Olivia's original speed on the beach and sidewalk.

Let's call Olivia's original speed on the beach ""x"" kilometers per hour. Since she walks 10 kilometers on the beach, her time spent on the beach is 10/x hours.

Since Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 4x kilometers per hour. Since she walks 10 kilometers on the sidewalk, her time spent on the sidewalk is 10/(4x) = 2.5/x hours.

Step 2: Calculate Olivia's new speed on the beach and sidewalk after the injury.

Since Olivia's speed has decreased by half on both the beach and sidewalk, her new speed on the beach is x/2 kilometers per hour, and her new speed on the sidewalk is 4x/2 = 2x kilometers per hour.

Step 3: Calculate the time spent on the beach after the injury.

Since Olivia's new speed on the beach is x/2 kilometers per hour, and she walks 10 kilometers on the beach, her time spent on the beach is 10/(x/2) = 20/x hours.

Step 4: Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk after the injury.

Since Olivia's new speed on the sidewalk is 2x kilometers per hour, and she walks 10 kilometers on the sidewalk, her time spent on the sidewalk is 10/(2x) = 5/x hours.

Step 5: Use the given information to find the value of x.

We are given that 60 minutes of Olivia's walk is spent on the beach. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can set up the equation:

20/x = 60/60

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20/x = 1

Multiplying both sides by x, we get:

20 = x

So, Olivia's original speed on the beach is 20 kilometers per hour.

Step 6: Calculate the time spent on the beach and sidewalk after the injury.

Now that we know Olivia's original speed on the beach, we can calculate the time spent on the beach and sidewalk after the injury.

Time spent on the beach: 20/x = 20/20 = 1 hour = 60 minutes

Time spent on the sidewalk: 5/x = 5/20 = 0.25 hours = 15 minutes

Step 7: Calculate the total time spent walking.

The total time spent walking is the sum of the time spent on the beach and sidewalk:

Total time = 60 + 15 = 75 minutes

Therefore, it takes Olivia 75 minutes to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk.",20.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out Olivia's original speed on the beach and the sidewalk. Since she walks 10 kilometers on the beach and 10 kilometers on the sidewalk, we can assume that her original speed on the beach and the sidewalk is the same, let's call it S kilometers per minute.

Since she walks 10 kilometers on the beach in 60 minutes, her original speed on the beach is 10 / 60 = 1/6 kilometers per minute.

Now, we know that she walks four times faster on the sidewalk than on the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is 4 * (1/6) = 4/6 = 2/3 kilometers per minute.

However, due to the injury, her speed has decreased by half on both the beach and the sidewalk. 

So, her new speed on the beach is (1/6) / 2 = 1/12 kilometers per minute, and her new speed on the sidewalk is (2/3) / 2 = 1/3 kilometers per minute.

The time it takes for her to walk 10 kilometers on the beach at the new speed of 1/12 kilometers per minute is 10 / (1/12) = 10 * 12 = 120 minutes.

The time it takes for her to walk 10 kilometers on the sidewalk at the new speed of 1/3 kilometers per minute is 10 / (1/3) = 10 * 3 = 30 minutes.

So, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk is 120 + 30 = 150 minutes.

The answer is 150.",150.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Olivia walks 20 kilometers every day, with 10 kilometers on the beach and 10 kilometers on the sidewalk.

The original speed on the beach and the sidewalk is not given, but we know that Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach.

Let's assume her original speed on the beach is x km/h.

Then her original speed on the sidewalk is 4x km/h.

However, due to an injury, her speed has decreased by half on both the beach and the sidewalk.

So, her new speed on the beach is x/2 km/h, and her new speed on the sidewalk is 4x/2 = 2x km/h.

We know that 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. 

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

Let's use the formula Time = Distance / Speed to solve this part of the problem.

Time spent on the beach is 10 km / (x/2) = 20/x hours.

The time spent on the sidewalk is 10 km / (2x) = 5/x hours.

The total time for the entire walk is the sum of the times spent on the beach and the sidewalk.

Total time = 20/x + 5/x = (25/x) hours.

We are not given a specific value for x, but we do know that total time is equal to the total distance (20 km) divided by x. However, we can express the total time for the walk as 20/x hours.

But we also know that this walk takes a total of (25/x) hours. 

Since the problem asks us to give the time for the entire 20-kilometer walk, we can set up the equation: 

20/x = 25/x

To find the speed x in km/h, we can calculate the time it takes to walk 10 km on the beach:

20/x = 60/60

To find x, we multiply both sides of the equation by x:

20 = 1*x

We cannot solve for x with the given information.

However, we know that the time spent on the beach is 1 hour.

Since 10 km on the sidewalk takes 5/x hours, the speed on the sidewalk is 10 / (5/x) = 2x km/h.

We are given that the time spent walking on the sidewalk is equal to the time spent walking on the beach. The time spent on the sidewalk is 5/x hours.

So, 5/x = 1.

To find x, we multiply both sides of the equation by x:

5 = x

This value of x is the speed on the beach. To find the speed on the sidewalk, we multiply this value by 4: 4 * 5 = 20 km/h.

The time to walk 10 km on the sidewalk is 10 / 20 = 0.5 hours.

The total time for the walk is the sum of the times spent on the beach and the sidewalk.

Total time = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.

288 pancakes / 12 pancakes/dozen = 24 dozen pancakes

Therefore, Arjun will need 24 dozen pancakes for 10 weeks.",10.0,0,"I'll follow the format you provided to solve the problem step by step.

Q: If Arjun eats 3 pancakes a day for 57 days and then increases it to 9 pancakes a day for the rest of the days, how many dozens of pancakes will Arjun need for 10 weeks?
A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many days are in 10 weeks.
There are 7 days in a week.
So, the total number of days in 10 weeks is 10 * 7 = 70 days.

Arjun eats 3 pancakes a day for 57 days.
So, the number of pancakes he eats in the first 57 days is 3 * 57 = 171 pancakes.

The rest of the days are 70 - 57 = 13 days.
Arjun eats 9 pancakes a day for the rest of the days.
So, the number of pancakes he eats in the next 13 days is 9 * 13 = 117 pancakes.

The total number of pancakes Arjun eats in 10 weeks is 171 + 117 = 288 pancakes.

Since we need to find out how many dozens of pancakes Arjun needs, we divide the total number of pancakes by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12).
288 / 12 = 24.

How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?",12.0,"To find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we need to calculate how many eggs each person found and then subtract that from the total number of eggs hidden initially.

1. Initial number of eggs = 11 dozen = 11 * 12 = 132 eggs

2. James finds 4 eggs.

3. Tara finds 5 times as many eggs as James, so Tara finds = 5 * 4 = 20 eggs.

4. Winnie finds 4 less than Tara, so Winnie finds = 20 - 4 = 16 eggs.

5. Noah finds half as many eggs as Winnie, so Noah finds = 16 / 2 = 8 eggs.

6. Oscar finds 4 dozen eggs (48 eggs) more than Tara and James combined. 
   Tara and James combined = 20 + 4 = 24 eggs.
   Oscar finds = 24 + 48 = 72 eggs.

Now, let's add up how many eggs each person found:
James = 4
Tara = 20
Winnie = 16

How much money does he make in a week?,1539.0,"To find out how much money Oliver makes in a week, we need to determine the total number of apartments and the total amount of money he earns from each collection.

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the first two apartment complexes:
   Apartment 1: 300
   Apartment 2: 300
   Total = 300 + 300 = 600

2. Calculate the size of the third apartment complex:
   The third complex is 50% bigger than the first two combined. So, it is 1.5 times the size of the first two combined.
   Size of the third complex = 1.5 * 600 = 900

Oliver collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes.
The first 2 complexes have 300 apartments each.
So, the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes is 300 + 300 = 600.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of apartments in all 3 complexes.
The last complex is 50% bigger than the other 2 combined.
50% of 600 is 0.5 * 600 = 300.
So, the last complex has 600 + 300 = 900 apartments.
The total number of apartments in all 3 complexes is 600 + 900 = 1500.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of collections per week.
Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each place.
There are 1500 apartments in total.
So, the total number of collections per week is 1500 * 2 = 3000.

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Oliver earns per collection.
Oliver gets paid Â¥0.45 per collection for each apartment.
So, the total amount of money he earns per collection is 0.45 * 1500 = Â¥675.

Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each place and he gets paid Â¥0.45 per collection for each apartment. He also earns 14% on tips. How much money does he make in a week?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes.
The first 2 complexes have 300 apartments each.
So, the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes is 300 + 300 = 600.

The last complex is 50% bigger than the other 2 combined.
50% of 600 is 0.5 * 600 = 300.
So, the last complex has 600 + 300 = 900 apartments.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apartments.
The first 2 complexes have 600 apartments.
The last complex has 900 apartments.
So, the total number of apartments is 600 + 900 = 1500.

Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each place.
So, he collects garbage 2 * 2 = 4 times a week from each apartment.

He gets paid Â¥0.45 per collection for each apartment.
So, he earns Â¥0.45 * 4 = Â¥1.80 per apartment per week.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he earns per week.
He earns Â¥1.80 per apartment per week.
There are 1500 apartments.
So, the total amount he earns per week is 1500 * Â¥1.80 = Â¥2700.

He also earns 14% on tips.
14% of Â¥2700 is 0.14 * Â¥2700 = Â¥378.

If the force need to move the car is 2% of the total weight, how much force does Esteban need to push the car?",44.0,"To find the total weight of Esteban's car and its contents, we need to add up the weights of the car, luggage, children, and spare tires.

1. Weight of the car: 1350 pounds
2. Weight of the luggage: 450 pounds
3. Weight of Esteban's 4 children: 4 x 65 = 260 pounds
4. Weight of the two spare tires: 2 x 70 = 140 pounds

Total weight = Weight of the car + Weight of the luggage + Weight of the children + Weight of the spare tires
Total weight = 1350 + 450 + 260 + 140
Total weight = 2100 pounds

Now, to find the force needed to move the car, we need to calculate 2% of the total weight.

2% of a number is the same as 0.02 x the number. 
Force needed = 0.02 x Total weight
Force needed = 0.02 x 2100
Force needed = 42

So, Esteban needs to push the car with a force of 42 pounds.",42.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

The total weight of the car is 1350 pounds.
The total weight of the luggage is 450 pounds.
The total weight of Esteban's 4 children is 65 pounds * 4 = 260 pounds.
The total weight of the two spare tires is 70 pounds * 2 = 140 pounds.
So, the total weight of the luggage, children, and spare tires is 450 + 260 + 140 = 850 pounds.
Now, we add the weight of the car to get the total weight: 1350 + 850 = 2200 pounds.
The force needed to move the car is 2% of the total weight.
To find 2% of 2200, we multiply 2200 by 0.02: 2200 * 0.02 = 44.
The answer is 44.",44.0,1,,44.0,1
gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct,"Oscar, Arash are currently 27 years apart in age. Oscar and Ali are currently 18 years apart. If Oscar, who is younger than Arash but older than Ali, is 54 years old, what's the average of their ages?",57.0,"To find the average of their ages, we need to find the ages of Arash and Ali.

Since Oscar is 54 years old and is 27 years younger than Arash, we can find Arash's age by adding 27 to Oscar's age:

Arash's age = Oscar's age + 27
= 54 + 27
= 81

Since Oscar is 18 years older than Ali, we can find Ali's age by subtracting 18 from Oscar's age:

Ali's age = Oscar's age - 18
= 54 - 18
= 36

Now that we have the ages of Arash and Ali, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 3 (since there are 3 people):

Average age = (Oscar's age + Arash's age + Ali's age) / 3
= (54 + 81 + 36) / 3
= 171 / 3
= 57

So, the average of their ages is 57.",57.0,1,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Oscar is 54 years old.
Oscar and Arash are 27 years apart in age.
So, Arash is 54 + 27 = 81 years old.

Oscar and Ali are 18 years apart in age.
So, Ali is 54 - 18 = 36 years old.

To find the average of their ages, we need to add their ages and divide by the number of people.
The sum of their ages is 54 + 81 + 36 = 171.
There are 3 people.
So, the average of their ages is 171 / 3 = 57.

The answer is 57.",57.0,1,,57.0,1

They have 1126 peanut butter cupcakes, 1634 lemon cupcakes, and some blueberry cupcakes. What percentage of the cupcakes they have made are blueberry cupcakes?",60.0,"To find the percentage of blueberry cupcakes, we need to first find the total number of blueberry cupcakes. We can do this by subtracting the number of peanut butter and lemon cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes.

Total cupcakes = 6900
Peanut butter cupcakes = 1126
Lemon cupcakes = 1634

Blueberry cupcakes = Total cupcakes - (Peanut butter cupcakes + Lemon cupcakes)
= 6900 - (1126 + 1634)
= 6900 - 2760
= 4140

Now that we know the number of blueberry cupcakes, we can find the percentage by dividing the number of blueberry cupcakes by the total number of cupcakes and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blueberry cupcakes = (Blueberry cupcakes / Total cupcakes) x 100
= (4140 / 6900) x 100
= 0.6 x 100
= 60%

So, the blueberry cupcakes make up 60% of the total number of cupcakes.",60.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
