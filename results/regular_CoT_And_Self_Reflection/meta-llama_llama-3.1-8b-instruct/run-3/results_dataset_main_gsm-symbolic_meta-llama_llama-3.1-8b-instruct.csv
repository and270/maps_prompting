   Cost of eclairs = 6 * $18 = $108

2. Calculate the cost of the cookies:
   Sofia bought 7 dozen cookies at $74 per dozen.
   Cost of cookies = 7 * $74 = $518

3. Calculate the cost of the muffins:
   Sofia bought 8 dozen muffins at $116 per dozen.
   Cost of muffins = 8 * $116 = $928

4. Calculate the total cost:

Sofia bought 6 dozen eclairs.
The cost of each dozen eclairs is $18.
So, the total cost of eclairs is 6 * $18 = $108.

She bought 7 dozen cookies.
The cost of each dozen cookies is $74.
So, the total cost of cookies is 7 * $74 = $518.

She bought 8 dozen muffins.
The cost of each dozen muffins is $116.
So, the total cost of muffins is 8 * $116 = $928.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of eclairs, cookies, and muffins.

But as I pour it, I spill 5 liters of the peach drink. How much water is in the remaining 31 liters?",7.0,"To find the total amount of water in the remaining 31 liters, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of water in the 20 liters of peach drink:
   20 liters (peach drink) * 1/5 (water fraction) = 4 liters of water in the peach drink

2. Since 5 liters of the peach drink are spilled, we calculate the remaining volume of the peach drink:
   20 liters (initial peach drink) - 5 liters (spilled peach drink) = 15 liters of peach drink remaining

3. Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of peach drink:
   15 liters (remaining peach drink) * 1/5 (water fraction) = 3 liters of water in the remaining peach drink

4. Calculate the amount of water in the 16 liters of lemon drink:
   16 liters (lemon drink) * 1/4 (water fraction) = 4 liters of water in the lemon drink

5. Now, calculate the total amount of water in the remaining 31 liters:
   Total water = water in peach drink + water in lemon drink
   Total water = 3 liters + 4 liters
   Total water = 7 liters

So, there are 7 liters of water in the remaining 31 liters of the mixture.",31.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's find out how much water is in the 20 liters of peach drink.
The peach drink is 1/5 water, so the amount of water in 20 liters is 20 * (1/5) = 4 liters.

Next, let's find out how much water is in the 16 liters of lemon drink.
The lemon drink is 1/4 water, so the amount of water in 16 liters is 16 * (1/4) = 4 liters.

Now, let's add the peach drink and lemon drink together, but subtract the 5 liters that were spilled.
The total amount of drink is 20 + 16 - 5 = 31 liters.

The amount of water in the peach drink is 4 liters, and the amount of water in the lemon drink is 4 liters.
So, the total amount of water in the remaining 31 liters is 4 + 4 = 8 liters.

However, we also need to consider the water that was spilled. Since the peach drink is 1/5 water, the amount of water that was spilled is 5 * (1/5) = 1 liter.

So, the total amount of water in the remaining 31 liters is 8 + 1 = 9 liters.

The answer is 9.",9.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

I initially answered the question incorrectly. To solve it correctly, let's analyze it step by step.

First, we need to find out how much water is in the 20 liters of peach drink. Since the peach drink is 1/5 water, we multiply 20 by 1/5 to find the amount of water.

20 liters * 1/5 = 20 * 0.2 = 4 liters of water in the peach drink.

Next, we need to find out how much water is in the 16 liters of lemon drink. Since the lemon drink is 1/4 water, we multiply 16 by 1/4 to find the amount of water.

16 liters * 1/4 = 16 * 0.25 = 4 liters of water in the lemon drink.

Now, we have a total of 20 liters of peach drink and 16 liters of lemon drink. However, 5 liters of the peach drink are spilled, leaving us with 20 - 5 = 15 liters of peach drink.

The total amount of liquid after the spill is 16 liters of lemon drink + 15 liters of peach drink = 31 liters.

The amount of water in the peach drink that remains is 15 liters * 1/5 = 15 * 0.2 = 3 liters.

The total amount of water in the 31 liters is the water from the peach drink that remains (3 liters) plus the water from the lemon drink (4 liters), which is 3 + 4 = 7 liters.

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct,"Jasmine can run five times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is 3/5 as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 6 hours if she spends 2/4 of the time running and three-sixths of the time walking?",36.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find Jasmine's running speed. Since she can skip at a rate of speed that is 3/5 as fast as she can run, and her skipping speed is 6 miles per hour, we can set up the following equation:

   Let's denote Jasmine's running speed as R. Since skipping speed is 3/5 of the running speed:
   3/5 * R = 6 miles per hour

   To find R, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/3:
   R = 6 * (5/3)
   R = 10 miles per hour

   So, Jasmine's running speed is 10 miles per hour.

2. Since Jasmine can skip 3/5 as fast as she can run, we can also find her walking speed. Let's denote walking speed as W. We know that running speed (R) is 10 miles per hour. We are given that she can skip at a rate of speed that is 3/5 as fast as she can run. Since skipping speed is 6 miles per hour, we can set up the following equation:
   We actually already know the skipping speed. The equation to find walking speed would be if we didn't know the skipping speed. But we do, so we can just use the information to find running speed.

   Now we know her running speed, but we still need her walking speed. 

   Since Jasmine can run 5 times faster than she can walk, we can set up the following equation:
   R = 5 * W

   We already know R is 10 miles per hour, so:
   10 = 5 * W

   To find W, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:
   W = 10 / 5
   W = 2 miles per hour

   So, Jasmine's walking speed is 2 miles per hour.

3. Now, we know Jasmine spends 2/4 of the time running and 3/6 of the time walking. Since 2/4 can be reduced to 1/2 and 3/6 can be reduced to 1/2, the problem is actually asking for her to spend equal parts of the time walking and running. To find how many hours she spends walking and running, we multiply the total time (6 hours) by each fraction:
   Walking time: 6 * 1/2 = 3 hours
   Running time: 6 * 1/2 = 3 hours

4. Now we know Jasmine spends 3 hours walking and 3 hours running, so we can find the total distance covered. To do this, we multiply the speed by the time for each activity:
   Distance walked: W * walking time = 2 * 3 = 6 miles
   Distance run: R * running time = 10 * 3 = 30 miles

   To find the total distance covered, we add the distance walked and the distance run:
   Total distance = distance walked + distance run
   Total distance = 6 + 30
   Total distance = 36 miles

The final answer is 36 miles.",36.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Jasmine can skip at 6 miles per hour. Since she can skip at a rate of speed that is 3/5 as fast as she can run, we need to find her running speed first.

Let's denote her running speed as R. Since her skipping speed is 3/5 of her running speed, we can write the equation: 3/5 * R = 6.

To find R, we multiply both sides of the equation by 5/3: R = 6 * 5/3 = 10.

So, Jasmine's running speed is 10 miles per hour.

Now we know that she spends 2/4 of the time running and 3/6 (which is 1/2) of the time walking. Since the total time is 6 hours, we first need to find the time she spends walking.

3/6 of 6 hours is 3 hours, so she spends 3 hours walking.

2/4 of 6 hours is 3 hours, so she spends 3 hours running.

Now, let's find the distance she travels while walking. Her walking speed is unknown, but we know that she can run 10 miles per hour and her walking speed is 1/5 of her running speed (since it's 3/5 as fast as she can run). Her walking speed is 10 * 1/5 = 2 miles per hour.

The distance she travels while walking is 2 miles per hour * 3 hours = 6 miles.

Now, let's find the distance she travels while running. The distance she travels while running is 10 miles per hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.

In total, Jasmine can travel 6 miles (walking) + 30 miles (running) = 36 miles in 6 hours.

After that, we can calculate the total ounces of bread you can eat.

Step 1: Calculate the remaining daily calorie target
You have already consumed 1700 calories, and your daily calorie target is 2360. To find the remaining calories, subtract the consumed calories from the target:

Remaining calories = 2360 - 1700 = 660

Step 2: Calculate the number of servings of bread you can eat
Each serving of bread has 275 calories. To find out how many servings you can eat, divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:

Number of servings = 660 / 275 = 2.4

Since you can't eat a fraction of a serving, we'll round down to 2 servings.

Step 3: Calculate the total ounces of bread you can eat
You have a 300-ounce bag of bread with 5 servings. To find out how many ounces are in each serving, divide the total ounces by the number of servings:

Ounces per serving = 300 / 5 = 60

Total ounces = 2 * 60 = 120

Therefore, you can eat 120 ounces of bread.",120.0,0,"Let's think step by step to solve this problem.

A 300 ounces bag has 5 servings, so we need to find out how many calories are in the entire bag.
Each serving of the bag has 275 calories.
So, the total number of calories in the bag is 5 * 275 = 1375 calories.

You already consumed 1700 calories, and your daily calorie target is 2360.

Q: According to its nutritional info, a bag of breads has 275 calories per serving. If a 300 ounces bag has 5 servings, how many ounces can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2360 and you have already consumed 1700 calories?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day.
The daily calorie target is 2360.
You have already consumed 1700 calories.
So, the number of calories left is 2360 - 1700 = 660.

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in the bag of breads.
The bag has 5 servings.
Each serving has 275 calories.
So, the total number of calories in the bag is 5 * 275 = 1375.

Now, we need to find out how many ounces can be eaten.
The bag has 300 ounces.
The number of calories left is 660.
Each serving has 275 calories.
So, the number of servings that can be eaten is 660 / 275 = 2.4.

Since the bag has 5 servings, we can eat 2.4 servings, which is 2 full servings and 0.4 of a serving.

To find the number of ounces that can be eaten, we multiply the number of servings by the total number of ounces in the bag.
2 full servings is 2 * 5 = 10 servings.
0.4 of a serving is 0.4 * 5 = 2 ounces.
So, the total number of ounces that can be eaten is 10 + 2 = 12 ounces.

However, this is not the answer I previously provided. Let me re-evaluate the problem.

Since the bag has 5 servings, we can eat 2 full servings, which is 2 * 5 = 10 servings.
Each serving has 275 calories.
So, the total number of calories in 2 full servings is 2 * 275 = 550.
We have 660 calories left for the day.
So, we can eat the remaining 660 - 550 = 110 calories.

Since each serving has 275 calories, we can eat 110 / 275 = 0.4 of a serving.
0.4 of a serving is 0.4 * 5 = 2 ounces.

However, this is still not the answer I previously provided. Let me re-evaluate the problem again.

Since the bag has 5 servings, we can eat 2 full servings, which is 2 * 5 = 10 servings.
Each serving has 275 calories.
So, the total number of calories in 2 full servings is 2 * 275 = 550.
We have 660 calories left for the day.
So, we can eat the remaining 660 - 550 = 110 calories.

Since each serving has 275 calories, we can eat 110 / 275 = 0.4 of a serving.
0.4 of a serving is 0.4 * 5 = 2 ounces.

However, we still have 110 calories left, and each serving has 275 calories. We can eat 110 / 275 = 0.4 of a serving, which is 2 ounces. But we still have 110 - 110 = 0 calories left, which means we can't eat any more.

However, we still have 300 - 10 = 290 ounces left in the bag.

Since we can't eat any more calories, we can eat the remaining 290 ounces.

1. On Tuesday and Wednesday, he watched a 6-hour episode each night. 
   Total hours for Tuesday and Wednesday = 6 + 6 = 12 hours

2. On Thursday, we are trying to find the number of 30-minute episodes. Let's denote this as 'x'. Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, Thursday's total hours from the 30-minute show = 0.5x

3. On Friday, he watched a 2-hour episode and a 30-minute show.

If she used a total of 77 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.",53.0,"To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of sugar used in the total mixture. 

The ratio of sugar to water is 53:24. First, we need to find the total parts in the ratio by adding 53 and 24. 

53 + 24 = 77

Now, we know that the total number of teaspoons of sugar and water used is equal to the total parts of the ratio, which is 77. 

Since the number of teaspoons of sugar is 53 out of 77 parts, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar used by dividing the total teaspoons (77) by the total parts (77) and then multiplying by the number of parts of sugar (53).

teaspoons_of_sugar = (53/77) * 77

To simplify this, we can divide 53 by 77. 

53 / 77 = 0.6884 (approximately)

Multiplying this by 77 will give us the number of teaspoons of sugar used:

teaspoons_of_sugar = 0.6884 * 77

Q: Emma makes coffee using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 53:24. If she used a total of 77 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.

A: Let's think step by step.
The ratio of sugar to water is 53:24.
This means that for every 53 parts of sugar, there are 24 parts of water.
The total number of parts is 53 + 24 = 77.
Since Emma used a total of 77 parts, we can set up a proportion to find the number of parts that are sugar.
Let x be the number of parts that are sugar.
Then, the number of parts that are water is 77 - x.
We know that the ratio of sugar to water is 53:24, so we can set up the proportion:
53/24 = x/(77-x)
To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
53(77-x) = 24x
4079 - 53x = 24x
4079 = 77x
x = 4079/77
x = 53
So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Emma used is 53.

We know that the total number of spoons Ananya had after her husband gave her the new package is the sum of the spoons in the package she bought and the 17 spoons her husband gave her: x + 17.

Then, Ananya used 10 spoons, so the number of spoons left is (x + 17) - 10 = x + 7.

Finally, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 23 spoons, which means that x + 7 = 23.

Ananya starts with an unknown number of spoons, which we'll call the number of spoons in the package she bought. Let's denote this as x.

She used 10 spoons to sample her vegetable lasagna, so the total number of spoons left before setting the table is x + 17 - 10 = x + 7.

Later, she had a total of 23 spoons, so we can set up the equation x + 7 = 23.

To find the value of x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation: x + 7 - 7 = 23 - 7.

**Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**

There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, and 6). The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:

3 (favorable outcomes) / 6 (total outcomes) = 1/2 = 0.5

There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6.
So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

Part 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5.
The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50% (or 0.5).
The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 25% (or 0.25).

How much money did Yusuf make in July if the company performed very well for the whole month?",3712.0,"To find out how much money Yusuf made in July, we need to calculate his total earnings for the month. 

Step 1: Calculate his daily earnings.
Yusuf works a 7-hour shift each day and earns €27 per hour. So, his daily earnings would be:
Daily earnings = 7 hours * €27 per hour
Daily earnings = €189

Step 2: Calculate his weekly earnings.
Yusuf works 4 days a week. So, his weekly earnings would be:
Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * 4

How many engineers are left if 26 artists stayed at the conference?",66.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Initially, there are 64 artists and 51 engineers. 

The total number of people at the beginning is: 
64 (artists) + 51 (engineers) = 115 people.

After half an hour, one-fifth of the total number of people left. 
One-fifth of 115 people is: 
115 * 1/5 = 23 people.

Total people left after half an hour: 
115 - 23 = 92 people.

Now, we know that 26 artists stayed at the conference. 
The number of artists who left is: 
64 (initial artists) - 26 (remaining artists) = 38 artists.

Since 38 artists left and 23 people in total left, the number of engineers who left is: 
23 (total people left) - 38 (artists left) = -15. However, the number of engineers cannot be negative. This indicates an error in the initial problem statement.

Let's assume the problem meant that one-fifth of the artists and one-fifth of the engineers left, not one-fifth of the total people.

One-fifth of the artists left: 
64 * 1/5 = 12.8 (approximately 13 artists left).

Since we cannot have a fraction of people, this approach also has an issue. 

However, let's try to solve the problem with this assumption: 

The number of artists who left is: 
64 (initial artists) - 26 (remaining artists) = 38 artists.

The number of artists who left (13 in the previous calculation, which is incorrect, but for the purpose of this solution we'll use 38) and the actual number of engineers who left were equal. To find the number of engineers who left, we set the equation:

38 (artists left) = x (engineers left).

However, we know that 1/5 of the total engineers left. The total number of engineers is 51.

One-fifth of the engineers:
51 * 1/5 = 10.2 (approximately 10 engineers left).

Now we know that 10.2 is the number of engineers who left, however since we cannot have 0.2 engineers the most likely answer is 10 engineers.

Since 10 engineers left, the number of engineers remaining is: 
51 (initial engineers) - 10 (engineers left) = 41 engineers.",41.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Initially, there were 64 artists and 51 engineers at the conference.
So, the total number of people at the conference was 64 + 51 = 115.

One-fifth of the total number of people left after half an hour.
One-fifth of 115 is 115 / 5 = 23.
So, 23 people left the conference.

Now, there were 51 engineers initially and 23 people left, but we don't know how many of the 23 people who left were engineers. 

We know that 26 artists stayed at the conference. Since one-fifth of the total people left, three-fourth of the total people stayed. 
So, the fraction of the total people who stayed is 3/4 and the fraction of the total people who left is 1/4.
In the group of 23 people who left, 1/4 of the total people were engineers because 23 represents 1/4 of the total people. 
Since 115 is the total number of people, 1/4 of 115 is 23.
So, the fraction of engineers who left is the same as the fraction of the total people who left, which is 1/4. 
Since 1/4 of the total people were engineers, 1/4 of 51 engineers left. 
1/4 of 51 is 51 / 4 = 12.75. Since we cannot have a fraction of a person, 12.75 is rounded down to 12 engineers for the purpose of this question, but we will use the actual fraction for the remainder of the problem.
The actual fraction of engineers who left is 12.75 = 51/4.
Since 12.75 engineers left, 51 - 12.75 = 38.25 engineers stayed at the conference.
Since 26 artists stayed at the conference, we can find the number of engineers who stayed by subtracting the number of artists from the total number of people who stayed.
Since there were 64 artists initially, and 26 stayed, the number of artists who left is 64 - 26 = 38.
The total number of people who stayed is 115 - 23 = 92.
So, the number of people who stayed is the sum of the number of engineers who stayed and the number of artists who stayed. 
We know that the number of artists who stayed is 26, and the number of people who stayed is 92. 
So, the number of engineers who stayed is 92 - 26 = 66.

We are given that 26 artists stayed at the conference.
Since there were 64 artists initially, the number of artists who left is 64 - 26 = 38.

The total number of people who left is 23 (as calculated earlier).
Since 38 artists left, the number of engineers who left is 23 - 38 = -15 (which is not possible, as we cannot have a negative number of people).
However, we know that 23 people left in total, and 38 artists left, so the number of engineers who left is actually 38 - 23 = 15.

The roller coaster cost $11 a ride. How many friends can she invite?",1.0,"Let's break down the costs:

1. Laser tag: Sofia wants to play one round, but she also wants to make sure her friends can play one round. So, the total cost for laser tag will be the cost of one round for each person, including Sofia. 
   Cost of laser tag = $6 per person
2. Pinball tokens: Sofia wants $6 in pinball tokens.
3. Roller coaster: Sofia wants to ride the roller coaster 8 times. 
   Cost of roller coaster = $11 per ride

Let's calculate the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of laser tag + Cost of pinball tokens + Cost of roller coaster
Total cost = ($6 per person) + $6 + ($11 per ride * 8 rides)
Total cost = $6 per person + $6 + $88
Total cost = $6 per person + $94

Since Sofia has a budget of $200, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Number of people (including Sofia) * $6 per person + $94 = $200

Now, let's solve for the number of people:

Number of people * $6 per person = $200 - $94
Number of people * $6 per person = $106

Now, divide both sides by $6:

Number of people = $106 / $6

So, the total cost for laser tag will be 6 * x, where x is the number of friends.
The total cost for all activities is $94 + 6 * x.

A: Let's think step by step.
Sofia's mom has a budget of $200.

First, let's calculate the cost of the fudge. We need to break down the cost into two parts because of the discount. 

1. 16 kgs of fudge at ¥21 per kg will be 16 * ¥21 = ¥336.
2. The discount is 5 kgs 2/3. First, we convert 2/3 of a kg to a decimal, which is 0.67. So, the discount is 5 + 0.67 = 5.67 kgs. The discount price for 5.67 kgs will be 5.67 * ¥21 = ¥119.07. However, this is the discount value for 5.67 kgs at the full price. To find the discounted price per kg, we divide by the weight: 119.07 / 5.67 ≈ ¥21.00 per kg.

She scooped up 23 kgs. She also bought a mixed bag of sand dollars for ¥11.5 and 17 postcards that were ¥20.5 each. How much money does Sofia have left?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the fudge. Sofia buys 16 kgs at ¥21 per kg, which is 16 * 21 = ¥336. However, she gets 5 kgs 2/3 off, which is 5 * (2/3) = 3.33 kgs. So, the discount is 3.33 * 21 = ¥70. The cost of the fudge is 336 - 70 = ¥266.

Sofia also buys a mixed bag of sand dollars for ¥11.5 and 17 postcards that were ¥20.5 each. The total cost of the postcards is 17 * 20.5 = ¥349.5. The total cost of the sand dollars and postcards is 11.5 + 349.5 = ¥361.

The total cost of all the items is 266 (fudge) + 361 (sand dollars and postcards) = ¥627.

Sofia started with ¥1200. So, the amount of money she has left is 1200 - 627 = ¥573.

1. Noah slew 250 giants.

2. Luis slew 2/4 as many giants as Noah. To find out how many giants Luis slew, we need to multiply 250 by 2/4.

   2/4 = 0.5
   250 * 0.5 = 125

   So, Luis slew 125 giants.

3. Arash slew nine times as many giants as Luis. To find out how many giants Arash slew, we need to multiply 125 by 9.

   125 * 9 = 1125

   So, Arash slew 1125 giants.

4. Mateo slew 2/3 as many giants as Arash. To find out how many giants Mateo slew, we need to multiply 1125 by 2/3.

1. Calculate the total amount of money Liam spent on popcorn.
2. Determine the amount of money Liam had left after buying popcorn.
3. Calculate the amount of money Liam spent on pretzels.
4. Determine the number of pretzels Liam bought.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Liam spent on popcorn.

Liam bought 4 bags of popcorn at 25 cents each. To find the total amount spent on popcorn, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

4 bags × 25 cents/bag = 100 cents

Since there are 100 cents in 1 dollar, we can convert the total amount spent on popcorn to dollars:

100 cents = $1

Step 2: Determine the amount of money Liam had left after buying popcorn.

Liam had ₣1000 initially and spent $1 on popcorn. To find the amount of money left, we subtract the amount spent from the initial amount:

₣1000 - $1 = ₣999

However, we are given that Liam had 8% of his money left in change. This means that the amount left is 8% of ₣1000. To find the amount left, we can calculate 8% of ₣1000:

8% of ₣1000 = 0.08 × ₣1000 = ₣80

Since Liam had ₣80 left, we can set up an equation to find the amount spent:

₣1000 - x = ₣80

where x is the amount spent.

Solving for x, we get:

x = ₣920

This means that Liam spent ₣920 on popcorn and pretzels.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Liam spent on pretzels.

We already know that Liam spent $1 on popcorn. To find the amount spent on pretzels, we subtract the amount spent on popcorn from the total amount spent:

₣920 - $1 = ₣919

Since there are 100 cents in 1 dollar, we can convert the amount spent on pretzels to cents:

₣919 = 91900 cents

Step 4: Determine the number of pretzels Liam bought.

Each pretzel costs 100 cents. To find the number of pretzels Liam bought, we divide the amount spent on pretzels by the cost per pretzel:

91900 cents ÷ 100 cents/pretzel = 919 pretzels

Therefore, Liam bought 919 pretzels.",919.0,1,"I'll follow the format you provided to solve the problem step by step.

Q: The vending machines sell popcorn for 25 cents and pretzels for 100 cents. Liam spent ₣1000 and got 4 bags of popcorn and had 8% of his money left in change. How many pretzels did he buy?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money Liam spent on popcorn. 
Each bag of popcorn costs 25 cents.
Liam bought 4 bags of popcorn.
So, the total amount spent on popcorn is 4 * 25 = 100 cents.

Next, we need to find out how much money Liam had left after buying the popcorn. 
Liam started with ₣1000.
He spent ₣1 on popcorn (100 cents).
So, the amount of money left is ₣1000 - ₣1 = ₣999.

Since Liam had 8% of his money left in change, we can calculate the amount of money he spent on pretzels. 
8% of ₣1000 is ₣80.
So, the amount of money spent on pretzels is ₣1000 - ₣80 = ₣920.

Now, we need to find out how many pretzels Liam bought. 
Each pretzel costs 100 cents.
The total amount spent on pretzels is ₣920.
So, the number of pretzels bought is ₣920 / 100 = 9.2.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pretzel, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

A: Let's think step by step.

Liam starts with ₣1000.
He buys 4 bags of popcorn for 25 cents each.
The total cost of popcorn is 4 * 25 = ₣100.

**Cold Day:**
Tariq swims a mile in 16 minutes. To find out how long it takes him to swim 8 miles, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 8:

16 minutes/mile × 8 miles = 128 minutes

**Hot Day:**
When the water is warm, Tariq swims a mile in 6 minutes more than thrice as long as on a cold day. Thrice as long as 16 minutes is 16 × 3 = 48 minutes. Adding 6 minutes to that gives us:

48 minutes + 6 minutes = 54 minutes

54 minutes/mile × 8 miles = 432 minutes

**Difference:**
Now, we subtract the time it takes to swim 8 miles on a cold day from the time it takes to swim 8 miles on a hot day:

432 minutes - 128 minutes = 304 minutes

First, let's find out how long it takes Tariq to swim a mile on a warm day. 
When the water is warm, Tariq swims a mile in 6 minutes more than thrice as long as it takes him to swim a mile in cold water. 
Thrice the time it takes to swim a mile in cold water is 3 * 16 = 48 minutes. 
So, swimming in warm water takes 48 + 6 = 54 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it takes Tariq to swim 8 miles on a warm day.

Oscar sold 29 boxes of brownie on Friday.
He sold 12 fewer boxes of kiwi pie on Friday than on Saturday.
So, the number of kiwi pie boxes sold on Friday is 26 - 12 = 14.

On Saturday, he sold 11 more boxes of brownie than on Friday.
So, the number of brownie boxes sold on Saturday is 29 + 11 = 40.

How many students are leaving early?",48.0,"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of swimmers and the number of debate team members or dancers.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of swimmers**

20% of 100 students are swimmers. To find 20% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.20.

100 x 0.20 = 20

So, 20 students are swimmers.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of remaining students**

Since 20 students are swimmers, we subtract them from the total number of students to find the remaining students.

100 - 20 = 80

**Step 3: Calculate the number of debate team members or dancers**

35% of the remaining 80 students are debate team members or dancers. To find 35% of 80, we multiply 80 by 0.35.

80 x 0.35 = 28

So, 28 students are debate team members or dancers.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of students leaving early**

To find the total number of students leaving early, we add the number of swimmers and the number of debate team members or dancers.

20 (swimmers) + 28 (debate team members or dancers) = 48

First, let's find out how many students are swimmers. 
Mrs. Garcia's class has 100 students.
20% of the class are swimmers.
To find 20% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.2, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20.
So, 20 students are swimmers.

Next, we need to find out how many students are not swimmers.
100 students are in the class.
20 students are swimmers.
So, the number of non-swimmers is 100 - 20 = 80.

Now, we need to find out how many non-swimmers are debate team members or part of dancers.
35% of the remaining students are debate team members or part of dancers.
To find 35% of 80, we multiply 80 by 0.35, which is 0.35 * 80 = 28.
So, 28 students are debate team members or part of dancers.

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct,"Kimia has a flower bed that is 180 feet long. Kimia wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Kimia's flowers grow 3 feet wide so she needs to leave 15.0 feet between every plant. Kimia already owns 11 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ¥3 at the store, how much money will Kimia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",3.0,"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of plants Kimia can fit in her flower bed, and then calculate the total cost.

Step 1: Calculate the total space available for plants.
The flower bed is 180 feet long, and each plant requires a 3 feet space. However, Kimia needs to leave 15.0 feet between every plant. So, the total space available for each plant is 3 feet (for the plant) + 15 feet (for the gap) = 18 feet.

Since 18 feet is the space available for each plant, and we want to find out how many plants can fit, we need to divide the total length of the flower bed (180 feet) by the total space available for each plant (18 feet).

180 feet / 18 feet per plant = 10 plants

However, Kimia already owns 11 flowers. So, to find the total number of flowers she needs to buy, we subtract the number of flowers she already owns from the total number of flowers the flower bed can accommodate.

10 plants (available) - 11 plants (owned) = -1 plants (available to buy)

Since Kimia can't buy a fraction of a plant or a negative number of plants, this means that her flower bed is too small to accommodate 11 plants with the given spacing. If we consider the total available space in the flower bed for gaps of 15 feet and plants, we can fit 9 plants (the total is 162 feet for the 9 plants and 18 feet gaps). However, considering the 180 feet of the flower bed, we can fit 10 plants. So we have two cases in which the initial assumption is wrong.

Case 1: If we fit 9 plants, the total space used for gaps is 9*15 feet = 135 feet, and the total space used for plants is 9*3 feet = 27 feet, for a total of 162 feet. This leaves 18 feet of unused space in the flower bed.

Case 2: If we fit 10 plants, the total space used for gaps is 10*15 feet = 150 feet, and the total space used for plants is 10*3 feet = 30 feet, for a total of 180 feet. This leaves no unused space in the flower bed.

Now, since Kimia has 11 plants and her flower bed can accommodate either 9 or 10 plants with the current spacing, we must calculate the cost for both cases.

For Case 1 (9 plants):
Kimia needs to buy 9 plants (11 - 2 = 9 plants she already owns, 2 more than 10, considering she cannot buy a fraction of a plant)
9 plants * ¥3 = ¥27

For Case 2 (10 plants):
Kimia needs to buy 1 plant (11 - 10 = 1 plant she already owns)
1 plant * ¥3 = ¥3

Since we've considered different scenarios, we must identify the case that fits the scenario given (fit 3 feet wide plants with 15 foot gaps).",15.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Kimia's flower bed is 180 feet long.
She needs to leave 15.0 feet between every plant.
The width of each flower is 3 feet.
So, the total space required for each plant, including the space between them, is 3 + 15 = 18 feet.

To find out how many plants Kimia can fit in her flower bed, we need to divide the length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant.
So, the number of plants Kimia can fit is 180 / 18 = 10.

Kimia already owns 11 flowers, but we calculated that she can only fit 10 plants in her flower bed. This means she will need to buy 10 - 11 = -1 flowers. However, since we can't buy a negative number of flowers, this means that Kimia's flower bed is too small to fit the 11 flowers she already owns.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Since Kimia can only fit 10 plants in her flower bed, and she already owns 11 flowers, she will need to remove one flower to fit the remaining 10 flowers in her flower bed.

The cost of each flower is ¥3.
Kimia needs to buy 10 flowers.
So, the total amount of money she will spend at the store is 10 * ¥3 = ¥30.

Q: Kimia has a flower bed that is 180 feet long. Kimia wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Kimia's flowers grow 3 feet wide so she needs to leave 15.0 feet between every plant. Kimia already owns 11 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ¥3 at the store, how much money will Kimia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many plants Kimia needs to buy to fill up her flower bed. To do this, we need to find the total space required for the plants, including the space between them.

The length of the flower bed is 180 feet. Each plant grows 3 feet wide, and there needs to be 15.0 feet between every plant. Let's assume the number of plants is x. Then, the total space required for the plants and the space between them is:

3x + (x - 1) * 15.0

This is because there are x plants, and between each plant, there is a space of 15.0 feet. Since there are x - 1 spaces between x plants, we multiply (x - 1) by 15.0.

The total length of the flower bed is 180 feet, so we can set up the equation:

3x + (x - 1) * 15.0 = 180

Now, let's simplify the equation:

3x + 15x - 15 = 180

Combine like terms:

18x - 15 = 180

Add 15 to both sides:

18x = 195

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 10.83

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. Kimia needs to buy 11 plants (10.83 + 0.17).

Kimia already owns 11 flowers, so she needs to buy 0 plants. However, this is not the correct answer because we need to consider the space between the plants. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The total length of the flower bed is 180 feet. Each plant grows 3 feet wide, and there needs to be 15.0 feet between every plant. Let's assume the number of plants is x. Then, the total space required for the plants and the space between them is:

3x + (x - 1) * 15.0

However, this is not the correct way to calculate the total space required. We need to consider the total space required for the plants and the space between them as a single unit.

The total space required for each plant and the space between it is 3 + 15 = 18 feet. Since there are x plants, the total space required is:

18x

**Peeling 90 clams:**

Fatima can peel 10 clams per minute. To find out how long it will take her to peel 90 clams, we can divide 90 by 10:

90 ÷ 10 = 9 minutes

So, it will take Fatima 9 minutes to peel 90 clams.

Q: Comet Hale-Bopp orbits the sun every 55 years. Viktor's father saw the Comet when he was 23 years old. Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. How old was Viktor when he saw the Comet for the first time?

A: Let's think step by step.
Viktor's father saw the Comet when he was 23 years old.
This means that the Comet had orbited the sun 23 times since Viktor's father saw it.
Since the Comet orbits the sun every 55 years, we can find the number of years that have passed since Viktor's father saw the Comet:
23 * 55 = 1265 years
However, this is not the information we need. We need to find Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the second time.
Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.
Viktor's father was 23 years old when he saw the Comet.
So, Viktor was 3 * 23 = 69 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time.
Now, we need to find Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the first time.
Since the Comet orbits the sun every 55 years, and Viktor's father saw the Comet 23 years ago, we can assume that Viktor saw the Comet for the first time 55 years before his father saw it.
However, this is not the case. We need to find Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the first time, not the time when his father saw it.
Let's re-evaluate the information:
Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.
Viktor's father was 23 years old when he saw the Comet.
So, Viktor was 3 * 23 = 69 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time.
Now, we need to find Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the first time.
We know that Viktor was 3 times his father's age when he saw the Comet for the second time.
We also know that Viktor's father was 23 years old when he saw the Comet.
So, Viktor was 3 * 23 = 69 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time.

Q: Comet Hale-Bopp orbits the sun every 55 years. Viktor's father saw the Comet when he was 23 years old. Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. How old was Viktor when he saw the Comet for the first time?

A: Let's think step by step.
Viktor's father saw the Comet when he was 23 years old.
Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.
So, Viktor was 3 * 23 = 69 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
We are asked to find Viktor's age when he saw the comet for the first time.
Since Viktor was 69 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, we need to subtract the number of years that have passed since the first sighting.
Comet Hale-Bopp orbits the sun every 55 years, so it has orbited the sun 69 / 55 = 1.25 times since Viktor's father saw it.
However, this information is not necessary to find Viktor's age when he saw the comet for the first time.
We can simply use the information that Viktor was three times his father's age when he saw the comet for the second time.
Let's denote Viktor's age when he saw the comet for the first time as x.
Then, Viktor's age when he saw the comet for the second time is 3x.
We know that Viktor was 69 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, so 3x = 69.
To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3.
x = 69 / 3 = 23.
However, this is Viktor's age when he saw the comet for the second time, not the first time.
We are asked to find Viktor's age when he saw the comet for the first time.
Since Viktor was three times his father's age when he saw the comet for the second time, we can set up the equation x = 3 * 23 - 55.
However, this equation is not correct.
We can simply use the fact that Viktor was three times his father's age when he saw the comet for the second time.
Let's denote Viktor's age when he saw the comet for the first time as x.
Then, Viktor's father's age when he saw the comet is x / 3.
We know that Viktor's father was 23 years old when he saw the comet, so x / 3 = 23.
To find x, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by 3.
x = 23 * 3 = 69.
However, this is Viktor's age when he saw the comet for the second time, not the first time.
We are asked to find Viktor's age when he saw the comet for the first time.
Since Viktor's father was 23 years old when he saw the comet, Viktor was 23 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's find out how many history questions there are. Since 20% of the questions are history, we can calculate this as follows:
20% of 100 is 0.20 * 100 = 20 history questions.

Next, let's find out how many economics and chemistry questions there are. Since the rest of the questions are equally divided between economics and chemistry, we can calculate this as follows:
100 - 20 = 80 questions left
80 / 2 = 40 economics and chemistry questions each

Now, let's find out how many points Emma is sure to get from the history questions:
Emma is sure to get 5% of the 20 history questions. 5% of 20 is 0.05 * 20 = 1 point.

Next, let's find out how many points Emma is sure to get from the economics and chemistry questions:
Emma is sure to get a quarter of the 40 economics questions. A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 questions. Since each question is worth 1 point, Emma is sure to get 10 points from the economics questions.
Similarly, Emma is sure to get a quarter of the 40 chemistry questions. A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 questions. Since each question is worth 1 point, Emma is sure to get 10 points from the chemistry questions.

The Scavenger hunt team hid 160 toys.

The Johnson twins each found 49 toys, so together they found 2 * 49 = 98 toys.

All the other toys except 13 were found by their friends.

So, the total number of toys found by the friends is 160 - 98 - 13 = 49.

However, the statement ""all the other toys except 13"" means that 13 toys are not included in the count of toys found by the friends.

Q: The Scavenger hunt team hid 160 toys. The Johnson twins each found 49 toys. All the other toys except 13 were found by their friends. How many toys did the friends find?

A: Let's think step by step.

The Johnson twins found 49 toys each, so together they found 49 + 49 = 98 toys.

There are 160 toys in total, and 98 were found by the Johnson twins. This means that 160 - 98 = 62 toys were found by their friends.

How many kgs of ore can 20 trolls with titanium pickaxes mine in a month with 31 days?,8060.0,"Let's break down the information step by step:

1. One troll can mine 5 kgs of ore per day with bare hands.
2. With a nickel pickaxe, one troll can mine twice as much as with bare hands, so:
   5 kgs/day * 2 = 10 kgs/day
3. With a titanium pickaxe, one troll can mine 30% more than with a nickel pickaxe. To find 30% of 10 kgs, we multiply 10 by 0.3:
   10 kgs * 0.3 = 3 kgs
   Then, we add this to the amount mined with a nickel pickaxe:
   10 kgs + 3 kgs = 13 kgs/day
4. Now, we know that one troll can mine 13 kgs of ore per day with a titanium pickaxe.
5. We need to find out how much ore 20 trolls with titanium pickaxes can mine in a month with 31 days. To do this, we multiply the amount one troll can mine in a day by the number of trolls and the number of days:
   13 kgs/day * 20 trolls * 31 days = 13 kgs/day * 620 trolls-days
   Since we are multiplying the same units, we can simply multiply the numbers:

The increase of 30% more is calculated by taking 10 * 0.3.

Now, let's find out how much one troll with a titanium pickaxe can mine in a month with 31 days.
The total amount of ore one troll with a titanium pickaxe can mine in a month is 13 kgs * 31 days = 13 * 31 = 403 kgs.

1. Emma walks 11 miles on the beach and 16 miles on the sidewalk. 

2.  The total distance she covers is 27 miles, which is the sum of the distance covered on the beach (11 miles) and the distance covered on the sidewalk (16 miles).

3. We are given that Emma walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. 

   Let's denote the speed on the beach as 'x'. 
   Then, the speed on the sidewalk is 4x.

4. Time taken is equal to the distance divided by speed. 
   Time taken to walk on the beach = Distance / Speed = 11 / x
   Time taken to walk on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 16 / 4x

5. We are given that 66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach.

Emma walks 27 miles every day. The 27 miles include 11 miles of walking on the beach and 16 miles of walking on the sidewalk.

Let's think about the time it takes for her to walk on the beach. We know that she walks 11 miles on the beach, and it takes her 66 minutes to walk this distance.

To find out her speed on the beach, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time. 

So, her speed on the beach is 11 miles / 66 minutes = 0.1667 miles per minute.

Now, let's think about the time it takes for her to walk on the sidewalk. We know that she walks 16 miles on the sidewalk, and her speed on the sidewalk is four times her speed on the beach.

So, her speed on the sidewalk is 4 * 0.1667 miles per minute = 0.6668 miles per minute.

Now, let's find out how long it takes for her to walk 16 miles on the sidewalk. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed.

So, the time it takes for her to walk 16 miles on the sidewalk is 16 miles / 0.6668 miles per minute = 24 minutes.

Now, let's find out the total time it takes for her to complete the entire 27-mile walk. We know that it takes her 66 minutes to walk 11 miles on the beach and 24 minutes to walk 16 miles on the sidewalk.

4. Convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
   Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

1. Tariq hid 9 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we can calculate the total number of eggs:
9 dozen x 12 eggs/dozen = 108 eggs

2. Noah finds 5 eggs. So, the number of eggs left is:
108 - 5 = 103 eggs

3. Emma finds four times as many as Noah. Since Noah found 5 eggs, Emma finds:
4 x 5 = 20 eggs

So, the number of eggs left is:
103 - 20 = 83 eggs

4. Olivia finds 2 less than Emma. Since Emma found 20 eggs, Olivia finds:
20 - 2 = 18 eggs

So, the number of eggs left is:
83 - 18 = 65 eggs

5. Alejandro finds 1/2 as many as Olivia. Since Olivia found 18 eggs, Alejandro finds:

How much money does he make in a week?,2538.0,"To calculate how much Ali makes in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the first 3 complexes:

Number of apartments in each of the first 3 complexes = 300
Total number of apartments in the first 3 complexes = 3 * 300 = 900

Step 2: Calculate the number of apartments in the last complex, which is 35% bigger than the other 3 combined:

35% of 900 is 0.35 * 900 = 315
So the last complex has 900 + 315 = 1215 apartments

Step 3: Calculate the total number of apartments in all 4 complexes:

Total number of apartments = 900 + 1215 = 2115

Step 4: Calculate the number of garbage collections per week for each complex:

Ali collects garbage 3 times a week from each place. So, the total number of collections per week for all 4 complexes = 4 * 3 = 12 collections

Step 5: Calculate the total amount Ali earns per collection:

Ali gets paid €0.4 per collection for each apartment. So, the total amount he earns per collection from all apartments = 0.4 * 2115 = €846

Since he collects garbage 12 times a week, the total amount he makes in a week = 846 * 12 = €10152",10152.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Ali collects garbage from 4 different apartment complexes. 

First, we need to find the total number of apartments in the first 3 complexes.
The first 3 complexes have 300 apartments each.

Now, we need to find the number of apartments in the last complex, which is 35% bigger than the other 3 combined.
To find 35% of 900, we multiply 0.35 by 900.
0.35 * 900 = 315.

Now, we add the 35% to the total number of apartments in the first 3 complexes to find the total number of apartments in the last complex.

Gabriel caught 3 trouts, but the question doesn't mention the weight of the first 3 trouts. However, it mentions the weight of the last 3 trouts. Let's assume the question is asking about the last 3 trouts.

The weight of the last 3 trouts is 43 + 45 + 28 = 116 kilograms.

The price of each kilogram of trout is ¥0.5.

So, the total amount Gabriel will earn is 116 * 0.5 = ¥58.

However, since the question mentions that Gabriel caught 5 trouts, we need to find the weight of the first 2 trouts.

Let's assume the weight of the first trout is x kilograms and the weight of the second trout is y kilograms.

The total weight of all 5 trouts is x + y + 43 + 45 + 28 = 116 + x + y.

Since Gabriel caught 5 trouts, the total weight of all 5 trouts is the sum of the weights of the first 3 trouts and the last 3 trouts.

We already know the weight of the last 3 trouts is 116 kilograms.

So, the total weight of all 5 trouts is 116 + x + y.

The price of each kilogram of trout is ¥0.5.

However, the question doesn't provide the weights of the first 2 trouts, so we cannot find the exact amount Gabriel will earn.

A: Let's think step by step.
Gabriel caught 5 trouts.
The total weight of the trouts is the sum of their individual weights.
The first trout weighs 43 kilograms.
The second trout weighs 45 kilograms.
The last trout weighs 28 kilograms.
So, the total weight of the trouts is 43 + 45 + 28 = 116 kilograms.
Since a kilogram of trout costs ¥0.5, the total amount Gabriel will earn is the total weight of the trouts multiplied by the cost per kilogram.
So, the total amount Gabriel will earn is 116 * 0.5 = ¥58.00.
However, this is not the total amount he will earn, but rather the amount he will earn per kilogram. To find the total amount he will earn, we need to multiply the amount he will earn per kilogram by the total number of kilograms.
Since Gabriel caught 5 trouts, the total number of kilograms is 5.

If they work 11 hours each day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?",50.0,"To find out the average percentage of the day spent cleaning rooms, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, calculate the total number of minutes the cleaner has to clean all rooms:
   Total minutes in a day = 11 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 660 minutes
   Total number of rooms = 110
   Total minutes to clean all rooms = 110 rooms * 15 minutes/room = 1650 minutes

2. Now, divide the total minutes to clean all rooms by the total minutes in a day to find the fraction of the day spent cleaning:
   Fraction of the day spent cleaning = Total minutes to clean all rooms / Total minutes in a day
   Fraction of the day spent cleaning = 1650 minutes / 660 minutes

3. To find the decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator:
   Fraction of the day spent cleaning = 1650 / 660 = 2.5

4. Now, convert the decimal to a percentage:
   Percentage of the day spent cleaning = (Fraction of the day spent cleaning) * 100
   Percentage of the day spent cleaning = 2.5 * 100 = 250%

However, this percentage doesn't make sense because you cannot spend more than 100% of the day on a single activity. It means the cleaner is spending more time than they have available to clean all the rooms. 

To understand the problem better, let's calculate the total available minutes for cleaning over 5 days:
   Total minutes for 5 days = 5 days * 660 minutes/day = 3300 minutes

Now, divide the total minutes to clean all rooms by the total available minutes for cleaning to find the fraction of the total available minutes spent cleaning:
   Fraction of the total available minutes spent cleaning = Total minutes to clean all rooms / Total available minutes
   Fraction of the total available minutes spent cleaning = 1650 minutes / 3300 minutes

To find the decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator:
   Fraction of the total available minutes spent cleaning = 1650 / 3300 = 0.5

Now, convert the decimal to a percentage:
   Percentage of the total available minutes spent cleaning = (Fraction of the total available minutes spent cleaning) * 100

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 11 hours is 11 * 60 = 660 minutes per day.

So, the total time available to clean the hospital is 5 * 660 = 3300 minutes.

The percentage of their day spent cleaning rooms is (1650 / 3300) * 100.
To find the percentage, we can simplify the fraction: (1650 / 3300) = (165 / 330) = (33 / 66) = (11 / 22).
