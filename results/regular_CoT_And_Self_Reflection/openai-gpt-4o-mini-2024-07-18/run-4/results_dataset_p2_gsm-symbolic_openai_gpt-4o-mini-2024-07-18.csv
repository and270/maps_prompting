gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Sophia went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, and 60 mini cheesecakes. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,"To find the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen, we can start by calculating the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes before the discount.

1. **Calculate the cost of the donuts:**
   - Sophia bought 60 donuts.
   - Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, the number of dozens of donuts she bought is:
     \[
     \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ dozens}
     \]
   - The cost per dozen of donuts is $19, so the total cost for the donuts is:
     \[
     5 \text{ dozens} \times 19 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 95 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:**
   - Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes.
   - The number of dozens of mini cupcakes she bought is:
     \[
     \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ dozens}
     \]
   - The cost per dozen of mini cupcakes is $33, so the total cost for the mini cupcakes is:
     \[
     5 \text{ dozens} \times 33 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 165 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   - Let \( x \) be the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen.
   - The total cost for the mini cheesecakes is:
     \[
     5 \text{ dozens} \times x \text{ dollars/dozen} = 5x \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost before the discount is:
     \[
     95 + 165 + 5x = 260 + 5x \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Apply the 20% discount:**
   - The total amount paid after the discount is $1500. The equation for the total cost after the discount is:
     \[
     (260 + 5x) \times (1 - 0.20) = 1500
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     (260 + 5x) \times 0.80 = 1500
     \]
   - Dividing both sides by 0.80:
     \[
     260 + 5x = \frac{1500}{0.80} = 1875
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 260 from both sides:
     \[
     5x = 1875 - 260 = 1615
     \]
   - Divide by 5:
     \[
     x = \frac{1615}{5} = 323
     \]

Thus, the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is \(\boxed{323}\) dollars.",323.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the donuts:**
   - Sophia bought 60 donuts.
   - Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, she bought \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $19.
   - So, the total cost for the donuts is \( 5 \times 19 = 95 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:**
   - Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes.
   - She bought \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $33.
   - So, the total cost for the mini cupcakes is \( 5 \times 33 = 165 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   - Let \( x \) be the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen.
   - She bought 60 mini cheesecakes, which is \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozen.
   - So, the total cost for the mini cheesecakes is \( 5x \) dollars.
   - The total cost before the discount is \( 95 + 165 + 5x \).

4. **Apply the 20% discount:**
   - The total amount paid after the discount is $1500.
   - The total cost before the discount can be expressed as \( 0.8 \times (95 + 165 + 5x) = 1500 \).

5. **Set up the equation:**
   - \( 0.8 \times (260 + 5x) = 1500 \).
   - Dividing both sides by 0.8 gives:
   \[
   260 + 5x = \frac{1500}{0.8} = 1875.
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 260 from both sides:
   \[
   5x = 1875 - 260 = 1615.
   \]
   - Divide by 5:
   \[
   x = \frac{1615}{5} = 323.
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is $323.

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving. A 300 grams bag has 6 servings. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?",350.0,"To determine how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara, we first need to calculate their remaining calorie allowances based on their daily calorie targets and what they have already consumed.

### Step 1: Calculate Daily Calorie Target
1. **Hiroshi's Weight**: 220 lbs
   - Daily Calorie Target = 15 calories/pound × 220 lbs = 3300 calories

2. **Tara's Weight**: 140 lbs
   - Daily Calorie Target = 15 calories/pound × 140 lbs = 2100 calories

### Step 2: Calculate Remaining Calories
1. **Hiroshi's Caloric Situation**:
   - Total Calories Consumed = 1100 calories (food) + 200 calories (exercise burned) = 1100 - 200 = 900 calories net consumed
   - Remaining Calories = Daily Calorie Target - Net Calories Consumed
   - Remaining Calories = 3300 - 900 = 2400 calories

2. **Tara's Caloric Situation**:
   - Total Calories Consumed = 900 calories (food) + 200 calories (ice cream) = 1100 calories
   - Remaining Calories = Daily Calorie Target - Total Calories Consumed
   - Remaining Calories = 2100 - 1100 = 1000 calories

### Step 3: Calculate Popcorn Servings Needed
1. **Calories per Serving of Popcorn**: 200 calories
2. **Hiroshi's Remaining Servings**:
   - Remaining Servings = Remaining Calories / Calories per Serving
   - Remaining Servings = 2400 / 200 = 12 servings

3. **Tara's Remaining Servings**:
   - Remaining Servings = Remaining Calories / Calories per Serving
   - Remaining Servings = 1000 / 200 = 5 servings

### Step 4: Calculate Grams of Popcorn
1. **Total Grams of Popcorn per Bag**: 300 grams
2. **Grams per Serving**: 300 grams / 6 servings = 50 grams/serving

3. **Hiroshi's Total Grams of Popcorn**:
   - Total Grams = Remaining Servings × Grams per Serving
   - Total Grams = 12 servings × 50 grams/serving = 600 grams

4. **Tara's Total Grams of Popcorn**:
   - Total Grams = Remaining Servings × Grams per Serving
   - Total Grams = 5 servings × 50 grams/serving = 250 grams

### Step 5: Calculate the Difference
- Difference in Grams = Hiroshi's Total Grams - Tara's Total Grams
- Difference in Grams = 600 grams - 250 grams = 350 grams

### Conclusion
Hiroshi needs to consume **350 grams more popcorn** than Tara.",350.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate Hiroshi's daily calorie target:**
   - Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs.
   - The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight.
   - So, Hiroshi's daily calorie target is 220 lbs * 15 calories/lb = 3300 calories.

2. **Calculate Hiroshi's net calorie intake:**
   - Hiroshi has already consumed 1100 calories.
   - He has burned 200 calories through exercise.
   - So, his net calorie intake is 1100 - 200 = 900 calories.

3. **Calculate how many more calories Hiroshi can consume:**
   - Hiroshi's remaining calorie allowance is 3300 - 900 = 2400 calories.

4. **Calculate the calories in one serving of popcorn:**
   - A bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving.
   - There are 6 servings in a 300 grams bag.
   - So, the total calories in the bag is 200 calories/serving * 6 servings = 1200 calories.

5. **Calculate how many servings of popcorn Hiroshi can consume:**
   - To find out how many servings Hiroshi can consume with his remaining 2400 calories, we divide:
   - 2400 calories / 200 calories/serving = 12 servings.

6. **Calculate the total grams of popcorn Hiroshi can consume:**
   - Since one bag (300 grams) contains 6 servings, each serving is 300 grams / 6 = 50 grams.
   - Therefore, 12 servings would be 12 * 50 grams = 600 grams.

7. **Calculate Tara's daily calorie target:**
   - Tara weighs 140 lbs.
   - So, her daily calorie target is 140 lbs * 15 calories/lb = 2100 calories.

8. **Calculate Tara's net calorie intake:**
   - Tara has already consumed 900 calories from food and 200 calories from ice cream.
   - So, her total consumption is 900 + 200 = 1100 calories.

9. **Calculate how many more calories Tara can consume:**
   - Tara's remaining calorie allowance is 2100 - 1100 = 1000 calories.

10. **Calculate how many servings of popcorn Tara can consume:**
    - To find out how many servings Tara can consume with her remaining 1000 calories, we divide:
    - 1000 calories / 200 calories/serving = 5 servings.

11. **Calculate the total grams of popcorn Tara can consume:**
    - Each serving is 50 grams, so 5 servings would be 5 * 50 grams = 250 grams.

12. **Calculate how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara:**
    - Hiroshi can consume 600 grams, and Tara can consume 250 grams.
    - The difference is 600 grams - 250 grams = 350 grams.

The answer is 350 grams.",350.0,1,,350.0,1

She already has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges of her large country home. She also purchased 200 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Daphne remain with?",335.0,"To find out how many potted plants Daphne will have remaining, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of potted plants Daphne currently has:**
   - She has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges.
   - Total plants from ledges = 8 plants/ledge × 56 ledges = 448 plants.

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 60 minutes to cover every 4 miles of the city. However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city, we first need to understand the initial conditions and the effect of the wind speed change.

1. **City Size**: The city is 80 miles across.
2. **Distance to Cover 1/4 of the City**: 
   \[
   \text{1/4 of the city} = \frac{80 \text{ miles}}{4} = 20 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Fog Coverage Rate**: The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes. Therefore, the rate of coverage is:
   \[
   \text{Rate} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{15 \text{ minutes}}
   \]

4. **Time to Cover 20 Miles at Initial Rate**:
   To find out how long it would take to cover 20 miles at the initial rate:
   \[
   \text{Time} = 20 \text{ miles} \times 15 \text{ minutes/mile} = 300 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Effect of Wind Speed Halving**: The problem states that the wind speed will be halved in one hour. This means that after 60 minutes, the fog will cover less distance than it would have at the initial rate.

   - In the first hour (60 minutes), the fog covers:
   \[
   4 \text{ miles}
   \]
   - After 60 minutes, the wind speed is halved, which means the fog will cover half the distance in the same amount of time. Therefore, the new rate becomes:
   \[
   \text{New Rate} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \div 2 = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{30 \text{ minutes}}
   \]

6. **Distance Covered After 60 Minutes**: After the first hour, the fog has covered 4 miles.

7. **Remaining Distance to Cover**: 
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance to cover} = 20 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} = 16 \text{ miles}
   \]

8. **Time to Cover Remaining 16 Miles at New Rate**:
   Using the new rate of \(\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{30 \text{ minutes}}\):
   \[
   \text{Time} = 16 \text{ miles} \times 30 \text{ minutes/mile} = 480 \text{ minutes}
   \]

9. **Total Time to Cover 20 Miles**:
   The total time to cover 20 miles is:
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 60 \text{ minutes} + 480 \text{ minutes} = 540 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, it will take **540 minutes** for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city.",4.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge.
2. We need to find out how long it takes for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city.
3. 1/4 of the city is 80 miles / 4 = 20 miles.
4. The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes.
5. To find out how long it takes to cover 20 miles, we first determine how many 4-mile segments are in 20 miles: 20 miles / 4 miles = 5 segments.
6. Since it takes 60 minutes to cover each 4-mile segment, the total time to cover 20 miles is 5 segments * 60 minutes/segment = 300 minutes.

Now, we need to consider the wind speed being halved in one hour. However, since the question asks for the time to cover 1/4 of the city (20 miles) without specifying that the fog bank's speed changes during that distance, we will assume the initial speed applies for the entire distance.

The answer is 300 minutes.",300.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes.
2. The total distance of the city from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge is 80 miles.
3. To find out how long it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, we first calculate 1/4 of 80 miles:
   \[
   \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ miles}
   \]
4. Next, we need to determine how long it takes to cover 20 miles. Since the fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, we can find the time to cover 1 mile:
   \[
   \text{Time to cover 1 mile} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ miles}} = 15 \text{ minutes per mile}
   \]
5. Now, we calculate the time to cover 20 miles:
   \[
   \text{Time to cover 20 miles} = 20 \text{ miles} \times 15 \text{ minutes per mile} = 300 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. However, we also need to consider that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. This means that after 60 minutes, the fog bank will cover less distance. 

7. In the first hour (60 minutes), the fog bank covers 4 miles. After this hour, the speed is halved, so it will cover only 2 miles in the next hour (60 minutes).

8. Therefore, in the first hour, the fog bank covers 4 miles, and in the second hour, it covers an additional 2 miles, totaling 6 miles in 120 minutes.

9. To cover the remaining distance to reach 20 miles, we need to cover 20 - 6 = 14 miles. 

10. Since the speed is halved, it will take 30 minutes to cover 1 mile (instead of 15 minutes). Thus, to cover 14 miles:
    \[
    \text{Time to cover 14 miles} = 14 \text{ miles} \times 30 \text{ minutes per mile} = 420 \text{ minutes}
    \]

11. Finally, we add the time taken to cover the first 6 miles (120 minutes) to the time taken to cover the remaining 14 miles (420 minutes):

On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 2-hour episodes. On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?",6.0,"To find out how many 15-minute episodes Santiago watched on Thursday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he spent watching TV from Tuesday to Sunday, excluding Thursday.

1. **Tuesday**: Watched 4 hours.
2. **Wednesday**: Watched 4 hours.
3. **Thursday**: Let \( x \) be the number of 15-minute episodes he watched.
4. **Friday**: Watched 3 hours and 45 minutes. We convert this to hours:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} + \frac{45 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 \text{ hours}
   \]
5. **Saturday**: Watched three 2-hour episodes:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]
6. **Sunday**: Watched three 15-minute episodes. We convert this to hours:
   \[
   3 \times \frac{15 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 3 \times 0.25 = 0.75 \text{ hours}
   \]

Now, we can sum the hours watched from Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:

\[
\text{Total hours from Tuesday to Sunday} = 4 + 4 + 3.75 + 6 + 0.75
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

- \( 4 + 4 = 8 \)
- \( 8 + 3.75 = 11.75 \)
- \( 11.75 + 6 = 17.75 \)
- \( 17.75 + 0.75 = 18.5 \)

So, the total time watched from Tuesday to Sunday (excluding Thursday) is 18.5 hours.

Since Santiago watched a total of 20 hours of TV, we can find the time he spent watching TV on Thursday:

\[
\text{Time watched on Thursday} = 20 - 18.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours}

Next, we convert 1.5 hours into minutes:

\[
1.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \times 60 = 90 \text{ minutes}

Thus, the number of 15-minute episodes Santiago watched on Thursday is \( \boxed{6} \).",6.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total hours watched from Tuesday to Saturday:**
   - On Tuesday, Santiago watched 4 hours.
   - On Wednesday, he watched another 4 hours.
   - On Thursday, he watched some 15-minute episodes (we'll calculate this later).
   - On Friday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. 
     - 45 minutes is 0.75 hours, so total for Friday is 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.
   - On Saturday, he watched three 2-hour episodes.
     - Total for Saturday is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

2. **Add the hours from Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday:**
   - Total hours from Tuesday and Wednesday: 4 + 4 = 8 hours.
   - Total hours from Friday: 3.75 hours.
   - Total hours from Saturday: 6 hours.
   - So, total hours from Tuesday to Saturday (excluding Thursday) is:
     - 8 + 3.75 + 6 = 17.75 hours.

3. **Calculate the total hours watched on Sunday:**
   - On Sunday, he watched three 15-minute episodes.
     - 15 minutes is 0.25 hours, so total for Sunday is 3 * 0.25 = 0.75 hours.

4. **Add the hours from Sunday to the total from Tuesday to Saturday:**
   - Total hours from Tuesday to Saturday (17.75) + Sunday (0.75) = 17.75 + 0.75 = 18.5 hours.

5. **Calculate the hours watched on Thursday:**
   - Santiago watched a total of 20 hours of TV in all.
   - We already calculated that he watched 18.5 hours from Tuesday to Sunday.
   - Therefore, the hours watched on Thursday is:
     - 20 - 18.5 = 1.5 hours.

6. **Convert the hours watched on Thursday to 15-minute episodes:**

She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, and uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the ratios and the total amounts given.

1. **Understanding the Ratios**:
   - The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 54:27. This can be simplified:
     \[
     \frac{54}{27} = 2
     \]
   - This means for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, there are 1 cup of water.

2. **Milk and Cream Ratios**:
   - Nia uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, which simplifies to 1 tablespoon of milk per cup of water.
   - She uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar.

3. **Setting Up the Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of teaspoons of sugar used.
   - From the sugar to water ratio, the number of cups of water used will be \( \frac{x}{2} \).
   - The number of tablespoons of milk used will be equal to the number of cups of water, which is \( \frac{x}{2} \).
   - The number of tablespoons of heavy cream used will be \( 2x \) (since she uses 2 tablespoons of cream for every teaspoon of sugar).

4. **Total Amounts**:
   - The total amount of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is given as 240:
     \[
     x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x + \frac{x}{2} = 240
     \]

5. **Combining Like Terms**:
   - Combine the terms:
     \[
     x + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = 240
     \]
     \[
     x + 2x + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 240

Thus, the number of teaspoons of sugar Nia used is \( \boxed{60} \).",60.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. We know that Nia uses sugar and water in a ratio of 54:27. This means for every 54 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 27 cups of water.

2. We can simplify this ratio. Dividing both parts by 27 gives us:
   - Sugar: 54 / 27 = 2
   - Water: 27 / 27 = 1
   So, the simplified ratio is 2:1. This means for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 1 cup of water.

3. Nia also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water. This means she uses 1 tablespoon of milk for every cup of water.

4. Additionally, she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar.

5. Now, we need to find out how many total parts are involved in her recipe. 
   - For sugar (S) and water (W), we have:
     - 2 parts of sugar (S) + 1 part of water (W) = 3 parts.
   - For milk (M), since she uses 1 tablespoon of milk for every cup of water, we can say:
     - 1 part of milk (M) for every 1 part of water (W) = 1 part.
   - For cream (C), she uses 2 tablespoons of cream for every teaspoon of sugar, which means:
     - 2 parts of cream (C) for every 2 parts of sugar (S) = 2 parts.

6. Now, let's add up all the parts:
   - Sugar: 2 parts
   - Water: 1 part
   - Milk: 1 part
   - Cream: 2 parts
   Total parts = 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6 parts.

7. We know that the total amount used is 240 teaspoons (which includes sugar, water, milk, and cream). Since there are 6 parts in total, we can find the value of each part:
   - Each part = Total amount / Total parts = 240 / 6 = 40.

8. Now, we can find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used:
   - Since sugar is 2 parts, the amount of sugar used is 2 * 40 = 80 teaspoons.

The answer is 80.",80.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Nia uses sugar and water in a ratio of 54:27. This means for every 54 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 27 cups of water. We can simplify this ratio:
   - 54:27 simplifies to 2:1 (since both numbers can be divided by 27).

2. Nia also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water. This means she uses 1 tablespoon of milk for every cup of water.

3. Additionally, she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar.

4. We know that the total amount of ingredients used (sugar, water, cream, and milk) is 240 teaspoons.

5. Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as \( S \), the number of cups of water as \( W \), the number of tablespoons of cream as \( C \), and the number of tablespoons of milk as \( M \).

6. From the ratio of sugar to water (2:1), we can express the cups of water in terms of teaspoons of sugar:
   - \( W = \frac{S}{2} \).

7. From the milk usage, since she uses 1 tablespoon of milk for every cup of water:
   - \( M = W = \frac{S}{2} \).

8. From the cream usage, since she uses 2 tablespoons of cream for every teaspoon of sugar:
   - \( C = 2S \).

9. Now we can set up the equation for the total amount of ingredients:
   \[
   S + W + C + M = 240.
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for \( W \), \( C \), and \( M \):
   \[
   S + \frac{S}{2} + 2S + \frac{S}{2} = 240.
   \]

10. Combining like terms:
   \[
   S + \frac{S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} + 2S = 240,
   \]
   \[
   4S = 240.
   \]

11. Solving for \( S \):
   \[
   S = \frac{240}{4} = 60.

She noticed that she was out of plastic forks, so she bought a new package of forks. Later, her husband also bought a package of 8 new forks and gave them to Aisha. While Aisha was making the stuffed peppers, she used sixteen of the forks to sample her stuffed peppers, then threw away 6 defective forks. The guests also brought 2 packs of forks, each having 6 inside them. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 32 forks. How many forks were in the package that Aisha bought?",34.0,"Let's denote the number of forks in the package that Aisha bought as \( x \).

1. Aisha bought \( x \) forks.
2. Her husband bought 8 forks.
3. Aisha used 16 forks to sample the stuffed peppers.
4. Aisha threw away 6 defective forks.
5. The guests brought 2 packs of forks, each containing 6 forks, which totals \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) forks.

Now, we can set up the equation to find the total number of forks Aisha had after all these transactions:

\[
\text{Total forks} = x + 8 - 16 - 6 + 12
\]

We know that the total number of forks Aisha had at the end was 32. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
x + 8 - 16 - 6 + 12 = 32

Now, simplify the left side:

\[
x + 8 - 16 - 6 + 12 = x + (8 - 16 - 6 + 12)

\[
= x + (8 + 12 - 16 - 6)

In addition, Ravi owns a 13-square yard apricot field that produces 12 apricots per square yard. The apricots can be harvested every 4 months. In the span of two years, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?",1764.0,"To find out how many more bananas Ravi harvests than apricots in two years, we will first calculate the total harvest of bananas and apricots separately, and then compare the two.

### Step 1: Calculate the total bananas harvested

1. **Banana field area**: 10 square yards
2. **Bananas per four-fifths of a square yard**: 36 bananas

To find the number of bananas per square yard, we first calculate how many bananas are produced in one square yard:

\[
\text{Bananas per square yard} = \frac{36 \text{ bananas}}{\frac{4}{5} \text{ square yards}} = 36 \times \frac{5}{4} = 45 \text{ bananas per square yard}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total number of bananas harvested from the 10 square yards:

\[
\text{Total bananas} = 10 \text{ square yards} \times 45 \text{ bananas per square yard} = 450 \text{ bananas}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many times Ravi can harvest in two years. Since he harvests every 4 months, there are:

\[
\text{Number of harvests in 2 years} = \frac{24 \text{ months}}{4 \text{ months per harvest}} = 6 \text{ harvests}
\]

Thus, the total number of bananas harvested in two years is:

\[
\text{Total bananas in 2 years} = 450 \text{ bananas} \times 6 = 2700 \text{ bananas}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total apricots harvested

1. **Apricot field area**: 13 square yards
2. **Apricots per square yard**: 12 apricots

Now, we calculate the total number of apricots harvested from the 13 square yards:

\[
\text{Total apricots} = 13 \text{ square yards} \times 12 \text{ apricots per square yard} = 156 \text{ apricots}
\]

Using the same number of harvests (6) as for the bananas, the total number of apricots harvested in two years is:

\[
\text{Total apricots in 2 years} = 156 \text{ apricots} \times 6 = 936 \text{ apricots}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference between bananas and apricots

Now we can find out how many more bananas Ravi harvests than apricots:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total bananas} - \text{Total apricots} = 2700 \text{ bananas} - 936 \text{ apricots} = 1764
\]

### Conclusion

Ravi harvests **1764 more bananas** than apricots in the span of two years.",1764.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of square yards for the banana field:**
   Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field.

2. **Determine the number of bananas per square yard:**
   There are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard. 
   To find the number of bananas per square yard, we can set up a proportion:
   \[
   \text{Bananas per square yard} = \frac{36 \text{ bananas}}{\frac{4}{5} \text{ square yards}} = 36 \times \frac{5}{4} = 45 \text{ bananas per square yard}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of bananas in the banana field:**
   \[
   \text{Total bananas} = 10 \text{ square yards} \times 45 \text{ bananas per square yard} = 450 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. **Determine the harvest frequency for bananas:**
   Ravi can harvest his bananas every 4 months. In 2 years, there are:
   \[
   2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months}
   \]
   The number of harvests in 2 years is:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ months}}{4 \text{ months/harvest}} = 6 \text{ harvests}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of bananas harvested in 2 years:**
   \[
   \text{Total bananas harvested} = 450 \text{ bananas} \times 6 \text{ harvests} = 2700 \text{ bananas}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of square yards for the apricot field:**
   Ravi has 13 square yards of apricot field.

7. **Determine the number of apricots per square yard:**
   There are 12 apricots per square yard.

8. **Calculate the total number of apricots in the apricot field:**
   \[
   \text{Total apricots} = 13 \text{ square yards} \times 12 \text{ apricots per square yard} = 156 \text{ apricots}
   \]

9. **Determine the harvest frequency for apricots:**
   Ravi can harvest his apricots every 4 months, just like the bananas. Thus, he also has 6 harvests in 2 years.

10. **Calculate the total number of apricots harvested in 2 years:**
    \[
    \text{Total apricots harvested} = 156 \text{ apricots} \times 6 \text{ harvests} = 936 \text{ apricots}

What is the least amount Arjun can spend on everything?",212.0,"To determine the least amount Arjun can spend, we will calculate the total cost of his purchases both with and without the membership discount.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost without membership

1. **Cost of folders**:
   \[
   12 \text{ folders} \times 4.75 \text{ dollars/folder} = 57.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of erasers**:
   \[
   8 \text{ erasers} \times 14.50 \text{ dollars/eraser} = 116.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of bond paper**:

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost with membership

1. **Cost of folders**:
   \[
   12 \text{ folders} \times 4.75 \text{ dollars/folder} = 57.00 \text{ dollars}

### Step 3: Compare the total costs

- Total cost without membership: $240.00
- Total cost with membership: $212.00

### Conclusion

The least amount Arjun can spend on everything is:
\[
\boxed{212.00} \text{ dollars}
\]",212.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost without any discounts:**
   - Cost of folders: 12 folders * $4.75 each = 12 * 4.75 = $57.00
   - Cost of erasers: 8 erasers * $14.50 each = 8 * 14.50 = $116.00
   - Cost of bond paper: 1 ream * $11.00 = $11.00
   - Cost of pencils: 7 pencils * $8.00 each = 7 * 8 = $56.00

   Now, let's add these costs together:
   - Total cost = $57.00 + $116.00 + $11.00 + $56.00 = $240.00

2. **Calculate the total cost with membership and a 20% discount:**
   - Membership fee = $20.00
   - Total cost before discount = $240.00
   - Discount = 20% of $240.00 = 0.20 * 240 = $48.00
   - Total cost with membership = $240.00 - $48.00 + $20.00 = $240.00 - $48.00 + $20.00 = $212.00

3. **Calculate the total cost without membership and a 5% discount:**
   - Total cost before discount = $240.00
   - Discount = 5% of $240.00 = 0.05 * 240 = $12.00
   - Total cost without membership = $240.00 - $12.00 = $228.00

4. **Compare the two total costs:**
   - Total cost with membership = $212.00
   - Total cost without membership = $228.00

The least amount Arjun can spend on everything is the lower of the two totals.

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Yusuf is rolling a twenty-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row, than that he rolls four even numbers in a row?",50.0,"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events: rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row and rolling four even numbers in a row with a twenty-sided die.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5.

A twenty-sided die has the numbers 1 through 20. The numbers greater than 5 are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. 

Counting these, we find:
- Numbers greater than 5: 15 (from 6 to 20)

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is:
\[
P(\text{greater than 5}) = \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is:
\[
P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) = P(\text{greater than 5}) \times P(\text{greater than 5}) = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) \times \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \frac{9}{16}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the probability of rolling an even number.

The even numbers on a twenty-sided die are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20. 

Counting these, we find:
- Even numbers: 10 (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20)

The probability of rolling an even number is:
\[
P(\text{even}) = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling an even number four times in a row is:
\[
P(\text{even four times}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16}
\]

### Step 5: Compare the two probabilities.

Now we have:
- Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice: \(\frac{9}{16}\)
- Probability of rolling four even numbers: \(\frac{1}{16}\)

### Step 6: Calculate the difference in percentage points.

To express these probabilities as percentages:
- Probability of rolling greater than 5 twice:
\[
\frac{9}{16} \times 100 = 56.25\%
\]
- Probability of rolling four even numbers:
\[
\frac{1}{16} \times 100 = 6.25\%
\]

Now, we find the difference:
\[
\text{Difference} = 56.25\% - 6.25\% = 50\%
\]

### Final Answer

Yusuf is **50 percentage points** more likely to roll a number greater than 5 twice in a row than to roll four even numbers in a row.",5.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a twenty-sided die.**
   - The numbers greater than 5 on a twenty-sided die are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
   - There are 15 numbers greater than 5.
   - The total number of outcomes on a twenty-sided die is 20.
   - So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is:
     \[
     P(\text{greater than 5}) = \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row.**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is:
     \[
     P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) = P(\text{greater than 5}) \times P(\text{greater than 5}) = 0.75 \times 0.75 = 0.5625
     \]

3. **Determine the probability of rolling an even number on a twenty-sided die.**
   - The even numbers on a twenty-sided die are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20.
   - There are 10 even numbers.
   - So, the probability of rolling an even number is:
     \[
     P(\text{even}) = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]

4. **Calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row.**
   - The probability of rolling an even number four times in a row is:
     \[
     P(\text{four evens}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.5^4 = 0.0625
     \]

5. **Calculate the difference in probabilities.**
   - Now, we find the difference in percentage points between the two probabilities:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) - P(\text{four evens}) = 0.5625 - 0.0625 = 0.5
     \]

6. **Convert the difference to percentage points.**
   - To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     \text{Difference in percentage points} = 0.5 \times 100 = 50
     \]

1. Mia found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. 
   - Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13.

3. Mia found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
   \]
4. In total, the number of animals in the plot is the sum of bees, beetles, rabbits, and wasps:
   - Bees: 9
   - Beetles: 6
   - Rabbits: 13
   - Wasps: 24
   \[
   \text{Total animals} = 9 + 6 + 13 + 24 = 52
   \]
5. Now, we need to find the percentage of animals that were rabbits:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of rabbits} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of rabbits}}{\text{Total animals}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{13}{52} \right) \times 100

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?",11000.0,"To determine how much more the total cost will be than Mrs. Lee's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the townhouse after applying the discount and adding the brokerage and transfer fees.

1. **Calculate the discount on the selling price:**
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = 400,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 25\% \text{ of } 400,000 = 0.25 \times 400,000 = 100,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = 400,000 - 100,000 = 300,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee (5% of the selling price):**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 5\% \text{ of } 400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the transfer fee (12% of the selling price):**
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 12\% \text{ of } 400,000 = 0.12 \times 400,000 = 48,000

5. **Determine how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Lee's budget:**
   \[
   \text{Budget} = 340,000

1. The selling price of the property is $400,000.
2. Mrs. Lee can get a 25% discount on the selling price.
   - The discount amount is 25% of $400,000:
     \[
     \text{Discount} = 0.25 \times 400,000 = 100,000
     \]
   - So, the discounted price is:
     \[
     \text{Discounted Price} = 400,000 - 100,000 = 300,000

3. Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price:
   - The brokerage fee is:
     \[
     \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000

4. Now, we calculate the transfer fee, which is 12% of the selling price:
   - The transfer fee is:
     \[
     \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 400,000 = 48,000

5. Now, we can calculate the total cost of the property, which includes the discounted price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee:
   - The total cost is:

He also paid $440000 for the remaining loan amount on the villa, and $5000 for closing costs. Dr. Brown used the net proceeds from selling the villa to invest in stocks. The stocks gained 10% each year for two years. How much were Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years?",80465.0,"To find Dr. Brown's net proceeds after selling his villa and investing in stocks, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the legal fees**:
   \[
   \text{Legal Fees} = 2\% \text{ of } 550,000 = 0.02 \times 550,000 = 11,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the realtor fee**:
   \[
   \text{Realtor Fee} = 5\% \text{ of } 550,000 = 0.05 \times 550,000 = 27,500

3. **Calculate the total costs incurred from the sale**:
   \[
   \text{Total Costs} = \text{Legal Fees} + \text{Realtor Fee} + \text{Closing Costs} + \text{Remaining Loan Amount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Costs} = 11,000 + 27,500 + 5,000 + 440,000 = 483,500

4. **Calculate the net proceeds from the sale**:
   \[
   \text{Net Proceeds} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Total Costs}

Thus, Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years are **$80,465**.",80465.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the legal fees:**
   - The selling price of the villa is $550,000.
   - The legal fees are 2% of the selling price.
   - Legal fees = 2% of $550,000 = 0.02 * 550,000 = $11,000.

2. **Calculate the realtor fee:**
   - The realtor fee is 5% of the selling price.
   - Realtor fee = 5% of $550,000 = 0.05 * 550,000 = $27,500.

3. **Calculate the total fees paid:**
   - Total fees = Legal fees + Realtor fee = $11,000 + $27,500 = $38,500.

4. **Calculate the net proceeds from the sale:**
   - Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees - Remaining loan amount - Closing costs.
   - Remaining loan amount = $440,000.
   - Closing costs = $5,000.
   - Net proceeds = $550,000 - $38,500 - $440,000 - $5,000 = $66,500.

5. **Calculate the investment growth over two years:**
   - The stocks gain 10% each year.
   - After the first year, the value of the investment = Net proceeds + (10% of Net proceeds).
   - Value after 1 year = $66,500 + (0.10 * $66,500) = $66,500 + $6,650 = $73,150.
   - After the second year, the value of the investment = Value after 1 year + (10% of Value after 1 year).
   - Value after 2 years = $73,150 + (0.10 * $73,150) = $73,150 + $7,315 = $80,465.

An eighth of the tennis balls are indigo, and all except an eighth of those indigo balls are marked. How many marked balls are there in total?",16.0,"To find the total number of marked balls, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of balls**: The juggler can juggle 160 balls.

2. **Golf balls**: 
   - \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the balls are golf balls.
   - Number of golf balls = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 160 = 32 \).

3. **Tennis balls**: 
   - The rest of the balls are tennis balls.
   - Number of tennis balls = Total balls - Golf balls = \( 160 - 32 = 128 \).

4. **Yellow golf balls**: 
   - \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the golf balls are yellow.
   - Number of yellow golf balls = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 32 = 16 \).

5. **Marked yellow golf balls**: 
   - \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the yellow golf balls are marked.

7. **Marked indigo tennis balls**: 
   - All except \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the indigo balls are marked.
   - Number of unmarked indigo tennis balls = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 16 = 2 \).
   - Therefore, the number of marked indigo tennis balls = Total indigo tennis balls - Unmarked indigo tennis balls = \( 16 - 2 = 14 \).

8. **Total marked balls**:

We know that there are 16 girls, and the number of boys is one-fourth the number of girls. Therefore, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Number of girls} = \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4

   - Total spotted puppies = Jamal's spotted puppies + Gabriel's spotted puppies + Yuki's spotted puppies
   - Total spotted puppies = 23 + 13 + 702 = 738 spotted puppies.

5. **Calculate the number of unspotted puppies for Jamal:**
   - Jamal's unspotted puppies = Total puppies - Spotted puppies
   - Jamal's unspotted puppies = 131 - 23 = 108 unspotted puppies.

6. **Determine how many of Jamal's unspotted puppies actually have spots:**
   - Half of Jamal's unspotted puppies have spots: 
   - Jamal's newly spotted puppies = 108 / 2 = 54 puppies.

7. **Calculate the new total number of spotted puppies:**
   - New total spotted puppies = Previous total spotted puppies + Newly spotted puppies
   - New total spotted puppies = 738 + 54 = 792 spotted puppies.

8. **Calculate the percentage of puppies that have spots:**
   - Percentage of spotted puppies = (Total spotted puppies / Total puppies) * 100
   - Percentage of spotted puppies = (792 / 880) * 100 ≈ 90%.

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Uma saw a 40-foot shark with 18 remoras, each 16 inches long attached to it. Then, 1/6 of the remoras swam away. Later, Uma saw another 10-foot shark with 6 remoras, each 8 inches long, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?",45.0,"To find the average percentage of each shark's body length that is covered by the remoras, we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert the lengths of the remoras from inches to feet.**
2. **Calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each shark.**
3. **Determine how many remoras remain after some swim away.**
4. **Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that is covered by the remaining remoras.**
5. **Find the average percentage for both sharks.**

### Step 1: Convert the lengths of the remoras to feet

- For the first shark, each remora is 16 inches long. 
  \[
  \text{Length in feet} = \frac{16 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 1.33 \text{ feet}
  \]

- For the second shark, each remora is 8 inches long.
  \[
  \text{Length in feet} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 0.67 \text{ feet}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each shark

- For the first shark (40-foot shark) with 18 remoras:
  \[
  \text{Total length of remoras} = 18 \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
  \]

- For the second shark (10-foot shark) with 6 remoras:
  \[
  \text{Total length of remoras} = 6 \times \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} = 4 \text{ feet}
  \]

### Step 3: Determine how many remoras remain after some swim away

- For the first shark, \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the remoras swim away:
  \[
  \text{Number of remoras that swim away} = \frac{1}{6} \times 18 = 3
  \]
  \[
  \text{Remaining remoras} = 18 - 3 = 15
  \]

- The total length of the remaining remoras for the first shark:
  \[
  \text{Total length of remaining remoras} = 15 \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ feet} = 20 \text{ feet}
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras

- For the first shark:
  \[
  \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{40 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 50\%
  \]

- For the second shark:
  \[
  \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{4 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 40\%
  \]

### Step 5: Find the average percentage for both sharks

\[
\text{Average percentage} = \frac{50\% + 40\%}{2} = \frac{90\%}{2} = 45\%

Thus, the average percentage of each shark's body length that is covered by the remoras is **45%**.",45.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the first shark:**
   - There are 18 remoras, each 16 inches long.
   - Total length of remoras = 18 * 16 = 288 inches.

2. **Convert the shark's length from feet to inches:**
   - The first shark is 40 feet long.
   - 1 foot = 12 inches, so 40 feet = 40 * 12 = 480 inches.

3. **Calculate the percentage of the first shark's body length covered by the remoras:**
   - Percentage = (Total length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100
   - Percentage for the first shark = (288 / 480) * 100 = 60%.

4. **Determine how many remoras swam away:**
   - 1/6 of the 18 remoras swam away.
   - Number of remoras that swam away = 18 / 6 = 3.
   - Remaining remoras = 18 - 3 = 15.

5. **Calculate the total length of the remaining remoras:**
   - Remaining remoras = 15, each 16 inches long.
   - Total length of remaining remoras = 15 * 16 = 240 inches.

6. **Calculate the percentage of the first shark's body length covered by the remaining remoras:**
   - Percentage for the remaining remoras = (240 / 480) * 100 = 50%.

7. **Now, calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the second shark:**
   - There are 6 remoras, each 8 inches long.
   - Total length of remoras = 6 * 8 = 48 inches.

8. **Convert the second shark's length from feet to inches:**
   - The second shark is 10 feet long.
   - 10 feet = 10 * 12 = 120 inches.

9. **Calculate the percentage of the second shark's body length covered by the remoras:**
   - Percentage for the second shark = (48 / 120) * 100 = 40%.

10. **Calculate the average percentage of both sharks:**
    - Average percentage = (Percentage of first shark + Percentage of second shark) / 2
    - Average percentage = (60 + 40) / 2 = 50%.

The answer is 50%.",50.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the first shark.

1. Uma saw a 40-foot shark with 18 remoras, each 16 inches long.
   - Convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet: 
     16 inches = 16 / 12 = 1.33 feet (approximately).
   - The total length of the remoras is:
     18 remoras * 1.33 feet/remora = 24 feet (approximately).

2. Then, 1/6 of the remoras swam away.
   - The number of remoras that swam away is:
     18 * (1/6) = 3 remoras.
   - The remaining number of remoras is:
     18 - 3 = 15 remoras.
   - The total length of the remaining remoras is:
     15 remoras * 1.33 feet/remora = 19.95 feet (approximately).

3. Now, we calculate the percentage of the first shark's body length covered by the remaining remoras:
   - The percentage is calculated as:
     (Total length of remaining remoras / Length of the shark) * 100
   - So, the percentage for the first shark is:
     (19.95 feet / 40 feet) * 100 = 49.875% (approximately 49.88%).

Next, we calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the second shark.

4. Uma saw another 10-foot shark with 6 remoras, each 8 inches long.
   - Convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet:
     8 inches = 8 / 12 = 0.67 feet (approximately).
   - The total length of the remoras is:
     6 remoras * 0.67 feet/remora = 4 feet (approximately).

5. Now, we calculate the percentage of the second shark's body length covered by the remoras:
   - The percentage is calculated as:
     (Total length of remoras / Length of the shark) * 100
   - So, the percentage for the second shark is:
     (4 feet / 10 feet) * 100 = 40%.

Finally, we find the average percentage of both sharks' body lengths covered by the remoras.

6. The average percentage is:
   (Percentage of first shark + Percentage of second shark) / 2
   - So, the average percentage is:
     (49.875% + 40%) / 2 = 44.9375% (approximately 44.94%).

Carlos has 720 almonds, 7 bowls and 3 tables. Unfortunately, 2 tables break. Carlos then eats one-fifth of all the almonds. How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?",14.0,"To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the capacity of the bowls and tables.**
   - Each bowl can hold 24 almonds.
   - Each table can hold three times that, which is \(3 \times 24 = 72\) almonds.

2. **Determine the total capacity of the bowls and tables before any breakage.**
   - Carlos has 7 bowls, so the total capacity of the bowls is:
     \[
     7 \text{ bowls} \times 24 \text{ almonds/bowl} = 168 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - Carlos has 3 tables, so the total capacity of the tables is:
     \[
     3 \text{ tables} \times 72 \text{ almonds/table} = 216 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total capacity of all bowls and tables combined is:
     \[
     168 \text{ almonds} + 216 \text{ almonds} = 384 \text{ almonds}
     \]

3. **Account for the broken tables.**
   - After 2 tables break, Carlos has:
     \[
     3 - 2 = 1 \text{ table}
     \]
   - The capacity of the remaining table is:
     \[
     1 \text{ table} \times 72 \text{ almonds/table} = 72 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - Now, the total capacity with the remaining table is:
     \[
     168 \text{ almonds (bowls)} + 72 \text{ almonds (remaining table)} = 240 \text{ almonds}
     \]

4. **Calculate how many almonds Carlos has after eating some.**
   - Carlos starts with 720 almonds and eats one-fifth of them:
     \[
     \text{Almonds eaten} = \frac{1}{5} \times 720 = 144 \text{ almonds}

   - The remaining almonds are:
     \[
     720 - 144 = 576 \text{ almonds}

5. **Determine how many more bowls are needed to hold the remaining almonds.**
   - Carlos can currently hold 240 almonds with the remaining bowls and table.
   - The number of additional almonds that need to be placed in bowls is:
     \[
     576 - 240 = 336 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - To find out how many additional bowls are needed, we divide the additional almonds by the capacity of each bowl:
     \[
     \text{Additional bowls needed} = \frac{336 \text{ almonds}}{24 \text{ almonds/bowl}} = 14 \text{ bowls}
     \]

Thus, Carlos needs **14 more bowls** to place all the remaining almonds.",14.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the capacity of the tables**: 
   Each bowl can hold 24 almonds. 
   Each table can hold three times that, so:
   \[
   \text{Capacity of each table} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ almonds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and tables**:
   Carlos has 7 bowls and 3 tables, but 2 tables break, leaving him with:
   \[
   \text{Remaining tables} = 3 - 2 = 1 \text{ table}

   \[
   \text{Total capacity of remaining table} = 1 \times 72 = 72 \text{ almonds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = 168 + 72 = 240 \text{ almonds}

3. **Determine how many almonds Carlos has left after eating**:
   Carlos starts with 720 almonds. He eats one-fifth of all the almonds:
   \[
   \text{Almonds eaten} = \frac{1}{5} \times 720 = 144 \text{ almonds}
   \]
   So, the remaining almonds are:
   \[
   \text{Remaining almonds} = 720 - 144 = 576 \text{ almonds}
   \]

4. **Determine if the current capacity is enough**:
   We need to check if the total capacity of 240 almonds can hold the remaining 576 almonds. Since 576 is greater than 240, Carlos does not have enough capacity.

5. **Calculate how many more bowls are needed**:
   First, we find out how many total bowls and tables would be needed to hold 576 almonds. Since each bowl holds 24 almonds, we calculate:

4. Carlos has 3 tables, but 2 tables break, leaving him with only 1 table.
5. The total capacity of the remaining table is:
   - 1 table * 72 almonds/table = 72 almonds.
6. The total capacity of the 7 bowls is:
   - 7 bowls * 24 almonds/bowl = 168 almonds.
7. Therefore, the total capacity of the bowls and the remaining table is:

2. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed for Keisha's jackets.**
3. **Sum the total skeins of wool needed.**
4. **Calculate the total cost before any discounts.**
5. **Apply the discount if applicable.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total skeins of wool for the grandchildren

- **Shawl:** 5 skeins per shawl × 4 grandchildren = \(5 \times 4 = 20\) skeins
- **Sweater:** 6 skeins per sweater × 4 grandchildren = \(6 \times 4 = 24\) skeins
- **Poncho:** 8 skeins per poncho × 4 grandchildren = \(8 \times 4 = 32\) skeins
- **Gloves:** 8 skeins per pair of gloves × 4 grandchildren = \(8 \times 4 = 32\) skeins
- **Mittens:** 14 skeins per pair of mittens × 4 grandchildren = \(14 \times 4 = 56\) skeins

Now, we sum these amounts:

\[
20 + 24 + 32 + 32 + 56 = 164 \text{ skeins}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total skeins of wool for Keisha's jackets

- **Jackets:** 8 skeins per jacket × 2 jackets = \(8 \times 2 = 16\) skeins

### Step 3: Total skeins of wool needed

Now, we add the skeins needed for the grandchildren and for Keisha:

\[
164 + 16 = 180 \text{ skeins}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost before discounts

Each dozen skeins costs $7. First, we need to find out how many dozens are in 180 skeins:

\[
\text{Dozens of skeins} = \frac{180}{12} = 15 \text{ dozens}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 15 \text{ dozens} \times 7 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 105 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Apply the discount

Since the total cost of $105 is over $100, Keisha qualifies for a $20 discount:

\[
\text{Final cost} = 105 - 20 = 85 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount Keisha should pay for all the skeins of wool she needs is:

\[
\boxed{85} \text{ dollars}
\]",85.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed for the grandchildren:**
   - For each grandchild, the wool needed is:
     - Shawl: 5 skeins
     - Sweater: 6 skeins
     - Poncho: 8 skeins
     - Gloves: 8 skeins
     - Mittens: 14 skeins
   - Total for one grandchild: 
     \( 5 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 14 = 41 \) skeins.
   - Since there are 4 grandchildren:
     \( 41 \times 4 = 164 \) skeins.

2. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed for Keisha:**
   - Keisha wants to make 2 jackets, each needing 8 skeins:
     \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \) skeins.

3. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed overall:**
   - Total skeins for grandchildren + Total skeins for Keisha:
     \( 164 + 16 = 180 \) skeins.

4. **Calculate the cost of the skeins of wool:**
   - Each dozen skeins costs $7. 
   - First, find out how many dozens are in 180 skeins:
     \( 180 \div 12 = 15 \) dozens.
   - Now, calculate the cost:
     \( 15 \times 7 = 105 \) dollars.

5. **Check if the discount applies:**
   - The total cost is $105, which is over $100, so Keisha gets a $20 discount.
   - Calculate the final cost after the discount:
     \( 105 - 20 = 85 \) dollars.

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,Mohammed goes to the store to buy some rice. The normal brand of rice he buys costs ¥15 per kg. He has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 3 kgs of rice per day. The store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs; any additional rice is sold at the regular price. Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2. How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,"To find out how much Mohammed has to pay, we can break down the problem into several steps:

1. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice:**
   - The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg.
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand.
   - 20% of ¥15 is:
     \[
     0.20 \times 15 = ¥3
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of the more expensive brand is:
     \[
     15 + 3 = ¥18 \text{ per kg}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of rice Mohammed needs for a week:**
   - Mohammed uses 3 kg of rice per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he needs:
     \[
     3 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ kg}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the first 10 kg of rice with the discount:**
   - The store has a 40% discount on the first 10 kg.
   - The discounted price per kg is:
     \[
     18 \text{ (original price)} - (0.40 \times 18) = 18 - 7.2 = ¥10.8 \text{ per kg}
     \]
   - The cost for the first 10 kg is:
     \[
     10 \text{ kg} \times 10.8 = ¥108
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the remaining rice (11 kg) at the regular price:**
   - The remaining amount of rice is:
     \[
     21 \text{ kg} - 10 \text{ kg} = 11 \text{ kg}
     \]
   - The cost for the remaining 11 kg at the regular price (¥18 per kg) is:
     \[
     11 \text{ kg} \times 18 = ¥198
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the rice:**
   - The total cost of the rice is:
     \[
     108 + 198 = ¥306
     \]

6. **Add the cost of the bagel:**
   - The cost of the bagel is ¥2.
   - Therefore, the total amount Mohammed has to pay is:
     \[
     306 + 2 = ¥308
     \]

Thus, the total amount Mohammed has to pay is **¥308**.",308.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice:**
   - The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg.
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more.
   - 20% of ¥15 is \( 0.20 \times 15 = ¥3 \).
   - Therefore, the cost of the more expensive brand is \( 15 + 3 = ¥18 \) per kg.

2. **Calculate the total amount of rice Mohammed needs for a week:**
   - Mohammed uses 3 kgs of rice per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he needs \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) kgs of rice.

3. **Calculate the cost of the first 10 kgs of rice with the discount:**
   - The store has a 40% discount on the first 10 kgs.
   - The cost of 10 kgs at ¥18 per kg is \( 10 \times 18 = ¥180 \).
   - The discount is 40% of ¥180, which is \( 0.40 \times 180 = ¥72 \).
   - Therefore, the cost after the discount for the first 10 kgs is \( 180 - 72 = ¥108 \).

4. **Calculate the cost of the remaining rice:**
   - Mohammed needs a total of 21 kgs, and he has already bought 10 kgs.
   - He needs an additional \( 21 - 10 = 11 \) kgs.
   - The cost for these 11 kgs at the regular price of ¥18 per kg is \( 11 \times 18 = ¥198 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the rice:**
   - The total cost for the rice is the cost of the first 10 kgs plus the cost of the additional 11 kgs:
   - Total cost = \( 108 + 198 = ¥306 \).

6. **Add the cost of the bagel:**
   - The bagel costs ¥2.
   - Therefore, the total amount Mohammed has to pay is \( 306 + 2 = ¥308 \).

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Jasmine and Mia are sisters from Nairobi who love collecting signatures from authors. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Jasmine and Mia compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Jasmine has 36 signatures in her book, and Mia has 31. The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,"To find out how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week to reach their goal of 145 signatures, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total signatures they currently have:**
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   - Mia has 31 signatures.
   - Total signatures = 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

2. **Determine how many more signatures they need to reach their goal:**
   - Their goal is 145 signatures.
   - Signatures needed = 145 - 67 = 78 signatures.

3. **Determine Jasmine's collection over the next 2 weeks:**
   - Jasmine's current weekly collection is not explicitly given, but we know that she will collect 5 fewer signatures per week than she normally would.
   - Let's denote Jasmine's normal weekly collection as \( J \).
   - In the next 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect signatures only on weekends, which means she will collect \( J - 5 \) signatures each week.
   - Therefore, in 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect \( 2(J - 5) = 2J - 10 \) signatures.

4. **Calculate Mia's required collection:**
   - Let \( M \) be the number of signatures Mia collects per week.
   - In 2 weeks, Mia will collect \( 2M \) signatures.
   - The total signatures collected by both sisters in the next 2 weeks will be:
     \[
     (2J - 10) + 2M
     \]
   - We want this total to equal the 78 signatures they need:
     \[
     (2J - 10) + 2M = 78
     \]

5. **Rearranging the equation:**
   - Rearranging gives us:
     \[
     2M = 78 - (2J - 10)
     \]
     \[
     2M = 78 - 2J + 10
     \]
     \[
     2M = 88 - 2J
     \]
     \[
     M = 44 - J
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Mia needs to collect \( 44 - J \) signatures per week, where \( J \) is Jasmine's normal weekly collection. Since we do not have the exact value of \( J \), we can express Mia's required collection in terms of Jasmine's normal collection.

If we assume Jasmine's normal weekly collection \( J \) is a reasonable number (for example, if she normally collects 15 signatures per week), we can substitute that value in to find Mia's required collection:

- If \( J = 15 \):
  \[
  M = 44 - 15 = 29
  \]

Thus, Mia would need to collect 29 signatures per week if Jasmine normally collects 15 signatures per week. You can adjust \( J \) based on any additional information you might have about Jasmine's normal collection rate.",15.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Current Signatures**: 
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   - Mia has 31 signatures.
   - Together, they have 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

2. **Goal**: 
   - They want to reach a total of 145 signatures.

3. **Signatures Needed**: 
   - To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the current total from their goal:
   - 145 - 67 = 78 signatures needed.

4. **Remaining Time**: 
   - They have 2 more weeks of spring break.

5. **Jasmine's Collection**: 
   - Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 signatures per week. 
   - Let's assume she normally collects \( x \) signatures per week. 
   - Therefore, in the remaining 2 weeks, she will collect:
   - (x - 5) + (x - 5) = 2(x - 5) = 2x - 10 signatures.

6. **Mia's Collection**: 
   - Let \( y \) be the number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week.
   - In 2 weeks, Mia will collect:
   - 2y signatures.

7. **Total Signatures Collected in 2 Weeks**: 
   - The total signatures collected by both sisters in the remaining 2 weeks will be:
   - (2x - 10) + 2y.

8. **Setting Up the Equation**: 
   - We know they need to collect 78 more signatures, so we set up the equation:
   - (2x - 10) + 2y = 78.

9. **Solving for Mia's Collection**: 
   - Rearranging the equation gives us:
   - 2y = 78 - (2x - 10)
   - 2y = 78 - 2x + 10
   - 2y = 88 - 2x.

10. **Dividing by 2**: 
    - y = 44 - x.

11. **Conclusion**: 
    - Mia needs to collect \( 44 - x \) signatures per week, where \( x \) is Jasmine's original weekly collection. 
    - Since we don't have the exact value of \( x \), we can conclude that Mia's collection depends on Jasmine's original collection rate.

The answer is that Mia needs to collect \( 44 - x \) signatures per week, where \( x \) is Jasmine's original weekly collection.",44.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Jasmine currently has 36 signatures.
2. Mia currently has 31 signatures.
3. Together, they have a total of 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

4. Their goal is to reach 145 signatures by the end of the break.
5. The number of signatures they still need to collect is 145 - 67 = 78 signatures.

6. They have 2 weeks left in their spring break.
7. Jasmine can only collect signatures on weekends, which means she will collect fewer signatures. She usually collects a certain number of signatures per week, but now she will collect 5 fewer each week.

8. Let's denote the number of signatures Jasmine usually collects per week as J. Therefore, in the remaining 2 weeks, she will collect:
   - Week 1: J - 5
   - Week 2: J - 5
   - Total from Jasmine in 2 weeks = (J - 5) + (J - 5) = 2J - 10.

9. Mia needs to collect enough signatures to make up the difference to reach their goal. Let’s denote the number of signatures Mia collects per week as M. Therefore, in the remaining 2 weeks, she will collect:
   - Week 1: M
   - Week 2: M
   - Total from Mia in 2 weeks = M + M = 2M.

10. The total signatures collected by both sisters in the remaining 2 weeks will be:
    - Total = (2J - 10) + (2M).

11. We know they need to collect a total of 78 signatures, so we set up the equation:
    - (2J - 10) + (2M) = 78.

12. Rearranging the equation gives us:
    - 2J + 2M - 10 = 78,
    - 2J + 2M = 88,
    - J + M = 44.

13. To find out how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week, we need to express M in terms of J:
    - M = 44 - J.

14. Since we know Jasmine's usual collection rate is not provided, we can assume a reasonable value for J. If we assume Jasmine usually collects 20 signatures per week, then:
    - M = 44 - 20 = 24.

15. Therefore, Mia needs to collect 24 signatures per week.

When they reach the gym, they remember they forgot their wallets at home, so they have to return to pick up their wallets and then walk all the way back to the gym again. Once they reach the gym for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the mall without being late?",42.0,"To find out how much time Sofia and Benjamin have left to get to the mall after returning to the gym, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Time to the cinema**: 16 minutes
2. **Time from the cinema to the gym**: 52 minutes

First, we calculate the total time taken to reach the gym the first time:

\[
\text{Total time to gym (first time)} = \text{Time to cinema} + \text{Time from cinema to gym} = 16 + 52 = 68 \text{ minutes}
\]

3. **Time to return home from the gym**: Since they have to return to pick up their wallets, the time taken to return home is the same as the time taken to get to the gym:

\[
\text{Time to return home} = 52 \text{ minutes (from gym to cinema)} + 16 \text{ minutes (from cinema to home)} = 68 \text{ minutes}
\]

4. **Time to go back to the gym**: After picking up their wallets, they need to walk back to the gym again, which takes the same amount of time as before:

\[
\text{Time to gym (second time)} = 68 \text{ minutes}
\]

5. **Total time spent so far**: Now we can calculate the total time spent by adding the time taken to reach the gym the first time, the time to return home, and the time to go back to the gym:

\[
\text{Total time spent} = 68 \text{ minutes (to gym)} + 68 \text{ minutes (return home)} + 68 \text{ minutes (to gym again)} = 204 \text{ minutes}

\[
\text{Time remaining} = 246 \text{ minutes} - 204 \text{ minutes} = 42 \text{ minutes}

He can make giant cubes that use 12 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 5 ounces, small cubes that use 1/2 of a ounce, and tiny cubes that are half the size of small cubes. He makes 48 total ice cubes, including 10 giant cubes, 14 small cubes, 12 medium cubes, and some tiny cubes. How many ounces of water does Leon have left?",122.0,"To find out how many ounces of water Leon has left after making the ice cubes, we first need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of ice cube he made.

1. **Giant Cubes**: 
   - Number of giant cubes = 10
   - Ounces per giant cube = 12
   - Total ounces used for giant cubes = \(10 \times 12 = 120\) ounces

2. **Medium Cubes**: 
   - Number of medium cubes = 12
   - Ounces per medium cube = 5
   - Total ounces used for medium cubes = \(12 \times 5 = 60\) ounces

3. **Small Cubes**: 
   - Number of small cubes = 14
   - Ounces per small cube = 0.5 (1/2 ounce)
   - Total ounces used for small cubes = \(14 \times 0.5 = 7\) ounces

4. **Tiny Cubes**: 
   - Let \(x\) be the number of tiny cubes.
   - Ounces per tiny cube = \(0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25\) ounces
   - Total ounces used for tiny cubes = \(x \times 0.25\) ounces

Next, we know that the total number of ice cubes made is 48. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
10 \text{ (giant)} + 12 \text{ (medium)} + 14 \text{ (small)} + x \text{ (tiny)} = 48
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
36 + x = 48
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = 48 - 36 = 12
\]

So, Leon made 12 tiny cubes.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of water used for the tiny cubes:

\[
\text{Total ounces used for tiny cubes} = 12 \times 0.25 = 3 \text{ ounces}
\]

Now, we can find the total amount of water used for all the cubes:

\[
\text{Total water used} = \text{water used for giant cubes} + \text{water used for medium cubes} + \text{water used for small cubes} + \text{water used for tiny cubes}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Total water used} = 120 + 60 + 7 + 3 = 190 \text{ ounces}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water Leon had:

\[
\text{Water left} = 312 - 190 = 122 \text{ ounces}
\]

Thus, the amount of water Leon has left is \(\boxed{122}\) ounces.",122.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Leon starts with 312 ounces of water.
2. He makes 10 giant cubes, and each giant cube uses 12 ounces of water. 
   So, the total water used for giant cubes is:
   \( 10 \times 12 = 120 \) ounces.
3. He makes 12 medium cubes, and each medium cube uses 5 ounces of water.
   So, the total water used for medium cubes is:

4. He makes 14 small cubes, each using 0.5 ounces of water.
   - So, the total water used for small cubes is 14 * 0.5 = 7 ounces.
5. Now, we need to calculate the total water used for the giant, medium, and small cubes:

What percentage of the students like to play video games if the number of the students that like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football?",5.0,"To find the percentage of students who like to play video games, we first need to determine how many students like to bake and how many like to play video games.

1. **Identify the number of students with specific hobbies:**
   - Students who like to hike: 69
   - Students who like to play chess: 8
   - Students who like to swim: 13
   - Students who like to play football: 13

2. **Calculate the total number of students who have specified hobbies:**
   \[
   \text{Total with specified hobbies} = 69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103
   \]

3. **Determine the number of students who like to bake:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of students who like to play football. According to the problem, the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number of students who like to play football:
   \[
   \text{Students who like to bake} = 4x - 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 13 \) (the number of students who like to play football):
   \[
   \text{Students who like to bake} = 4(13) - 3 = 52 - 3 = 49
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of students who like to play video games:**
   The total number of students in the class is 160. Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Students who like to play video games} = \text{Total students} - \text{Total with specified hobbies} - \text{Students who like to bake}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Students who like to play video games} = 160 - 103 - 49 = 160 - 152 = 8
   \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of students who like to play video games:**
   The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of students who like to play video games by the total number of students and then multiplying by 100:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Students who like to play video games}}{\text{Total students}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{8}{160} \right) \times 100 = 5\%

Thus, the percentage of students who like to play video games is \( \boxed{5\%} \).",5.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. We start with a class of 160 students.
2. The number of students who like to hike is 69.
3. The number of students who like to play chess is 8.
4. The number of students who like to swim is 13.
5. The number of students who like to play football is 13.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who have specified hobbies:

- Total students with specified hobbies = 69 (hiking) + 8 (chess) + 13 (swimming) + 13 (football)
- Total students with specified hobbies = 69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103

Next, we find out how many students are left who either like to play video games or bake:

- Students who like video games or bake = Total students - Students with specified hobbies
- Students who like video games or bake = 160 - 103 = 57

Now, we need to determine how many students like to bake. We know that the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number of students who like to play football:

- Number of students who like to play football = 13
- Four times the number of students who like to play football = 4 * 13 = 52
- Therefore, the number of students who like to bake = 52 - 3 = 49

Now, we can find the number of students who like to play video games:

- Students who like to play video games = Students who like video games or bake - Students who like to bake
- Students who like to play video games = 57 - 49 = 8

Finally, we calculate the percentage of students who like to play video games:

- Percentage of students who like to play video games = (Number of students who like to play video games / Total students) * 100
- Percentage of students who like to play video games = (8 / 160) * 100 = 5%

Jamal starts with $80 and wants 10 gallons of paint, each priced at $7.0, and 3 carpenter pencils, each costing $2. The store offers a 10% discount on paint for members. How much more money does Elena have left than Jamal after they leave the store?",8.0,"To find out how much more money Elena has left than Jamal after they leave the store, we need to calculate the total expenses for both Elena and Jamal and then determine their remaining balances.

### Step 1: Calculate Elena's total expenses

1. **Cost of anchors**:
   - Price per anchor = $0.26
   - Number of anchors = 15
   - Total cost for anchors = \( 15 \times 0.26 = 3.90 \)

2. **Cost of nails**:
   - Price per nail = $0.61
   - Number of nails = 9
   - Total cost for nails = \( 9 \times 0.61 = 5.49 \)

3. **Cost of paint**:
   - Price per gallon of paint = $7.00
   - Number of gallons = 10
   - Total cost for paint = \( 10 \times 7.00 = 70.00 \)

4. **Total cost for Elena**:
   - Total cost = Cost of anchors + Cost of nails + Cost of paint
   - Total cost = \( 3.90 + 5.49 + 70.00 = 79.39 \)

5. **Remaining balance for Elena**:
   - Initial amount = $98.39
   - Remaining balance = Initial amount - Total cost
   - Remaining balance = \( 98.39 - 79.39 = 19.00 \)

### Step 2: Calculate Jamal's total expenses

1. **Cost of paint** (with discount):
   - Price per gallon of paint = $7.00
   - Number of gallons = 10
   - Total cost for paint before discount = \( 10 \times 7.00 = 70.00 \)
   - Discount for members = 10% of $70.00 = \( 0.10 \times 70.00 = 7.00 \)
   - Total cost for paint after discount = \( 70.00 - 7.00 = 63.00 \)

2. **Cost of carpenter pencils**:
   - Price per pencil = $2.00
   - Number of pencils = 3
   - Total cost for pencils = \( 3 \times 2.00 = 6.00 \)

3. **Total cost for Jamal**:
   - Total cost = Cost of paint + Cost of pencils
   - Total cost = \( 63.00 + 6.00 = 69.00 \)

4. **Remaining balance for Jamal**:
   - Initial amount = $80.00
   - Remaining balance = Initial amount - Total cost
   - Remaining balance = \( 80.00 - 69.00 = 11.00 \)

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in remaining balances

1. **Difference in remaining balances**:
   - Difference = Elena's remaining balance - Jamal's remaining balance

**Step 2: Calculate how much money Elena has left.**
Elena starts with $98.39.
\[
\text{Money left for Elena} = 98.39 - 79.39 = 19.00
\]

**Step 3: Calculate Jamal's total expenses.**

- **Cost of paint:**
  Jamal wants 10 gallons of paint, each priced at $7.00.
  \[
  \text{Total cost of paint} = 10 \times 7.00 = 70.00
  \]

- **Cost of carpenter pencils:**

   - He wants 3 pencils.
   - Total cost for pencils = 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

3. **Total spending for Jamal before discount**: 
   - Total spending = Cost of paint + Cost of pencils = $70.00 + $6.00 = $76.00.

4. **Discount on paint for Jamal**: 
   - He gets a 10% discount on paint.
   - Discount = 10% of $70.00 = $7.00.
   - Total cost after discount = $70.00 - $7.00 = $63.00.

5. **Total spending for Jamal**: 
   - Total spending = Cost after discount + Cost of pencils = $63.00 + $6.00 = $69.00.

6. **Money left for Jamal**: 
   - He starts with $80.00.
   - Money left = $80.00 - $69.00 = $11.00.

5. **Stickers**: The sticker book has 6 pages, each with 12 stickers. So, the total number of stickers is:
   \[
   6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ stickers}
   \]
6. **Stacking Rings**: 29 multicolored rings

Now, we can sum all these items to find the total number of items Gabrielle has before adding the bouncy balls:

\[
\text{Total items} = \text{Building Blocks} + \text{Stuffed Animals} + \text{Action Figures} + \text{Crayons} + \text{Stickers} + \text{Stacking Rings}
\]
\[
\text{Total items} = 43 + 5 + 96 + 12 + 72 + 29
\]

Calculating this step by step:

- \(43 + 5 = 48\)
- \(48 + 96 = 144\)
- \(144 + 12 = 156\)
- \(156 + 72 = 228\)
- \(228 + 29 = 257\)

So, Gabrielle has a total of 257 items before adding the bouncy balls.

Now, we know that the total number of items after adding the bouncy balls is 320. Let \(x\) be the number of bouncy balls. We can set up the equation:

\[
257 + x = 320
\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 257 from both sides:

\[
x = 320 - 257
\]
\[
x = 63
\]

Thus, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is \(\boxed{63}\).",63.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Count the blocks**: Gabrielle has 43 blocks in the bag of building blocks.

2. **Count the stuffed animals**: There are 5 stuffed animals in the bin.

3. **Calculate the total number of blocks and stuffed animals**: 
   \[
   43 + 5 = 48
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of action figures**: The number of action figures is twice the total number of blocks and stuffed animals combined.
   \[
   2 \times 48 = 96

5. **Count the crayons**: The crayon box has 12 different colors of crayon.

6. **Count the stickers**: The sticker book has 6 pages, each with 12 stickers. So, the total number of stickers is:

7. **Count the stacking rings**: There are 29 multicolored rings on the tower of stacking rings.

8. **Now, let's add all these items together**:

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"A care facility has a capacity of 1900 rooms with 1/4 occupied and one-fourth of all the rooms being out of service. Due to the pandemic, 20 patients are admitted into the care facility each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks.",530.0,"To find the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rooms that are out of service.**
2. **Calculate the number of occupied rooms.**
3. **Calculate the number of unoccupied rooms.**
4. **Account for the daily admissions over 3 weeks.**
5. **Recalculate the number of unoccupied rooms after the admissions.**

### Step 1: Calculate the number of rooms that are out of service

The total capacity of the care facility is 1900 rooms. One-fourth of these rooms are out of service:

\[
\text{Rooms out of service} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475 \text{ rooms}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of occupied rooms

Since one-fourth of the total rooms are occupied, we calculate the number of occupied rooms:

\[
\text{Occupied rooms} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475 \text{ rooms}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of unoccupied rooms

First, we need to find the total number of rooms that are available for occupancy:

\[
\text{Available rooms} = \text{Total rooms} - \text{Rooms out of service} = 1900 - 475 = 1425 \text{ rooms}
\]

Now, we can find the number of unoccupied rooms:

\[
\text{Unoccupied rooms} = \text{Available rooms} - \text{Occupied rooms} = 1425 - 475 = 950 \text{ rooms}
\]

### Step 4: Account for the daily admissions over 3 weeks

Next, we need to calculate how many patients are admitted over 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in 3 weeks, there are:

\[
\text{Total days} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days}
\]

With 20 patients admitted each day, the total number of admissions over 3 weeks is:

\[
\text{Total admissions} = 20 \times 21 = 420 \text{ patients}
\]

### Step 5: Recalculate the number of unoccupied rooms after the admissions

Now we need to adjust the number of unoccupied rooms based on the admissions. The number of occupied rooms after the admissions will be:

\[
\text{New occupied rooms} = \text{Initial occupied rooms} + \text{Total admissions} = 475 + 420 = 895 \text{ rooms}
\]

Finally, we can find the new number of unoccupied rooms:

\[
\text{New unoccupied rooms} = \text{Available rooms} - \text{New occupied rooms} = 1425 - 895 = 530 \text{ rooms}
\]

### Conclusion

The total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks is:

\[
\boxed{530}
\]",530.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. The total capacity of the care facility is 1900 rooms.
2. One-fourth of the rooms are occupied. So, the number of occupied rooms is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475 \text{ rooms}
   \]
3. One-fourth of all the rooms are out of service. So, the number of rooms out of service is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475 \text{ rooms}
   \]
4. Now, we can calculate the total number of rooms that are either occupied or out of service:
   \[
   475 \text{ (occupied)} + 475 \text{ (out of service)} = 950 \text{ rooms}
   \]
5. To find the number of unoccupied rooms, we subtract the number of occupied and out of service rooms from the total capacity:
   \[
   1900 - 950 = 950 \text{ unoccupied rooms}
   \]
6. Next, we need to account for the 20 patients admitted each day for 3 weeks. First, we calculate the total number of days in 3 weeks:
   \[
   3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]
7. Now, we calculate the total number of patients admitted in 3 weeks:
   \[
   20 \text{ patients/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ patients}
   \]
8. Since these patients will occupy rooms, we need to subtract the number of patients from the unoccupied rooms:
   \[
   950 \text{ unoccupied rooms} - 420 \text{ patients} = 530 \text{ unoccupied rooms}

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Faisal is selling muffins and apricot pies for a fundraiser. On Wednesday, he sold 27 boxes of muffin and 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie, than on Thursday. On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday and 21 boxes of apricot pie. On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?",796.0,"To find Faisal's average daily earning, we first need to determine how many boxes of muffins and apricot pies he sold on each day.

### Step 1: Determine the number of boxes sold on Wednesday

Let:
- \( m_W \) = number of muffin boxes sold on Wednesday
- \( a_W \) = number of apricot pie boxes sold on Wednesday

From the problem, we know:
- \( m_W = 27 \)
- \( a_W = m_W - 13 = 27 - 13 = 14 \)

### Step 2: Determine the number of boxes sold on Thursday

Let:
- \( m_T \) = number of muffin boxes sold on Thursday
- \( a_T \) = number of apricot pie boxes sold on Thursday

From the problem, we know:
- \( m_T = m_W + 11 = 27 + 11 = 38 \)
- \( a_T = 21 \)

### Step 3: Determine the number of boxes sold on Friday

Let:
- \( m_F \) = number of muffin boxes sold on Friday
- \( a_F \) = number of apricot pie boxes sold on Friday

From the problem, we know that on Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. Therefore, we need to calculate the total boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday.

Total boxes sold on Wednesday:
\[
\text{Total}_W = m_W + a_W = 27 + 14 = 41
\]

Total boxes sold on Thursday:
\[
\text{Total}_T = m_T + a_T = 38 + 21 = 59
\]

Total boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday combined:
\[
\text{Total}_{W+T} = \text{Total}_W + \text{Total}_T = 41 + 59 = 100
\]

Thus, on Friday, he sold:
\[
m_F + a_F = 100
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the earnings for each day

Now we need to calculate the earnings for each day.

**Earnings on Wednesday:**
\[
\text{Earnings}_W = (m_W \times 9) + (a_W \times 21) = (27 \times 9) + (14 \times 21)
\]
Calculating:
\[
27 \times 9 = 243
\]
\[
14 \times 21 = 294
\]
\[
\text{Earnings}_W = 243 + 294 = 537
\]

**Earnings on Thursday:**
\[
\text{Earnings}_T = (m_T \times 9) + (a_T \times 21) = (38 \times 9) + (21 \times 21)
\]
Calculating:
\[
38 \times 9 = 342
\]
\[
21 \times 21 = 441
\]
\[
\text{Earnings}_T = 342 + 441 = 783
\]

**Earnings on Friday:**
Since we know \( m_F + a_F = 100 \), we can express \( a_F \) in terms of \( m_F \):
\[
a_F = 100 - m_F
\]
Thus, the earnings on Friday can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Earnings}_F = (m_F \times 9) + ((100 - m_F) \times 21)
\]
Expanding this:
\[
\text{Earnings}_F = (m_F \times 9) + (100 \times 21) - (m_F \times 21)
\]
\[
= m_F \times (9 - 21) + 2100
\]
\[
= -12m_F + 2100
\]

To find \( m_F \), we can use the total boxes sold on Friday:
Since \( m_F + a_F = 100 \), we can assume \( m_F = x \) and \( a_F = 100 - x \).

We can also express the total earnings on Friday as:
\[
\text{Earnings}_F = 9x + 21(100 - x) = 9x + 2100 - 21x = -12x + 2100
\]

### Step 5: Calculate total earnings and average

Now we can calculate the total earnings over the three days:
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Earnings}_W + \text{Earnings}_T + \text{Earnings}_F
\]
Substituting the values we found:
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = 537 + 783 + (-12m_F + 2100)
\]

To find \( m_F \), we can use the fact that \( m_F + a_F = 100 \) and the total earnings must equal the total boxes sold multiplied by their respective prices.

### Step 6: Calculate average daily earnings

The average daily earnings can be calculated as:
\[
\text{Average Daily Earnings} = \frac{\text{Total Earnings}}{3}
\]

Now we can calculate the average daily earnings based on the total earnings we calculated.

### Final Calculation

Let's assume \( m_F = 50 \) (as a reasonable guess since he sold 100 total on Friday):
\[
a_F = 100 - 50 = 50
\]
Then:
\[
\text{Earnings}_F = 9(50) + 21(50) = 450 + 1050 = 1500
\]

Now we can calculate the total earnings:
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = 537 + 783 + 1500 = 2820
\]

Finally, the average daily earnings:
\[
\text{Average Daily Earnings} = \frac{2820}{3} = 940

1. **Determine the number of boxes sold on Wednesday:**
   - Faisal sold 27 boxes of muffins on Wednesday.
   - He sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pies than on Thursday. 

2. **Determine the number of boxes sold on Thursday:**
   - On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday.
   - So, the number of muffins sold on Thursday is:
     \[
     27 + 11 = 38 \text{ boxes}
     \]
   - He sold 21 boxes of apricot pies on Thursday.

3. **Calculate the total boxes sold on Wednesday:**
   - Since he sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pies than on Thursday, the number of apricot pies sold on Wednesday is:
     \[
     21 - 13 = 8 \text{ boxes}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total boxes sold on Friday:**
   - On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined.
   - Total boxes sold on Wednesday:
     \[
     27 \text{ (muffins)} + 8 \text{ (apricot pies)} = 35 \text{ boxes}

   - Total boxes sold on Thursday:
     \[
     38 \text{ (muffins)} + 21 \text{ (apricot pies)} = 59 \text{ boxes}

   - Total boxes sold in the past two days:
     \[
     35 + 59 = 94 \text{ boxes}

   - **Earnings on Friday:**
     - Total boxes sold on Friday is 94.
     - Total earnings on Friday:
     \[
     (27 + 38 + 94) \text{ muffins} \times 9 + (8 + 21 + 0) \text{ apricot pies} \times 21
     \]
     - However, we can calculate it directly:
     - Total muffins sold over three days: \(27 + 38 + 94 = 159\)
     - Total apricot pies sold over three days: \(8 + 21 + 0 = 29\)
     - Total earnings on Friday:
     \[
     159 \times 9 + 29 \times 21 = 1431 + 609 = 2040

   - Total earnings:
   \[
   411 + 783 + 2040 = 3234
   \]

7. **Calculate the average daily earning:**
   - There are 3 days, so the average daily earning is:

1. On Wednesday, Faisal sold 27 boxes of muffins.
2. He sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pies than on Thursday. Let's denote the number of apricot pies sold on Thursday as \( x \). Therefore, on Wednesday, he sold \( x - 13 \) boxes of apricot pies.
3. On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday. So, he sold \( 27 + 11 = 38 \) boxes of muffins on Thursday.
4. We know he sold 21 boxes of apricot pies on Thursday. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x = 21

   This means on Wednesday, he sold \( 21 - 13 = 8 \) boxes of apricot pies.
5. Now we can summarize the sales:
   - Wednesday: 27 muffins and 8 apricot pies.
   - Thursday: 38 muffins and 21 apricot pies.
6. On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. Let's calculate the total sales from Wednesday and Thursday:
   - Total muffins sold: \( 27 + 38 = 65 \)
   - Total apricot pies sold: \( 8 + 21 = 29 \)
   - Therefore, on Friday, he sold \( 65 + 29 = 94 \) boxes in total.

Half of the swimmers are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the tournament?",66.0,"To find out how many students are leaving early to the tournament, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of swimmers:**
   - Total students in the class = 120
   - Percentage of swimmers = 50%
   - Number of swimmers = 50% of 120 = \(0.5 \times 120 = 60\)

2. **Calculate the number of non-swimmers:**
   - Number of non-swimmers = Total students - Number of swimmers
   - Number of non-swimmers = \(120 - 60 = 60\)

3. **Calculate the number of choir members or dancers:**
   - Percentage of non-swimmers who are choir members or dancers = 45%
   - Number of choir members or dancers = 45% of 60 = \(0.45 \times 60 = 27\)

4. **Calculate the number of students leaving early:**
   - Half of the swimmers are absent due to being sick, so the number of swimmers leaving = \(60 \div 2 = 30\)

1. **Determine the total width occupied by each plant**: Each flower grows 3 meters wide, and Olga needs to leave 12 meters between every plant. Therefore, the total space occupied by each plant, including the space between them, is:
   \[
   3 \text{ meters (width of the plant)} + 12 \text{ meters (space)} = 15 \text{ meters}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many plants can fit in the flower bed**: The flower bed is 132 meters long. To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space occupied by each plant:
   \[
   \frac{132 \text{ meters}}{15 \text{ meters per plant}} = 8.8
   \]
   Since Olga can only plant whole flowers, we round down to 8 plants.

3. **Determine how many more plants Olga needs to buy**: Olga already owns 7 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:
   \[
   8 \text{ (total needed)} - 7 \text{ (already owned)} = 1 \text{ flower}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the additional flowers**: Each flowering plant costs ₣9. Since Olga only needs to buy 1 flower, the total cost is:
   \[
   1 \text{ flower} \times ₣9 = ₣9
   \]

5. **Check for discounts**: Olga only receives a discount if she buys more than 2 plants. Since she is only buying 1 plant, she does not qualify for the discount.

6. **Final cost**: Therefore, the total amount of money Olga will spend at the store is:
   \[
   ₣9

How many minutes will it take her to peel and saute 150 clams if it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam before peeling it? Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.,163.0,"To determine how long it will take Olga to peel and sauté 150 clams, we need to break down the tasks into their respective times and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the time to wash the clams
Olga needs to wash each clam before peeling it, and it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam. 

For 150 clams:
\[
\text{Time to wash} = 150 \text{ clams} \times 12 \text{ seconds/clam} = 1800 \text{ seconds}
\]

Convert seconds to minutes:
\[
1800 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time to peel the clams
Olga can peel 6 clams per minute. 

For 150 clams:
\[
\text{Time to peel} = \frac{150 \text{ clams}}{6 \text{ clams/minute}} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the break time
After peeling, Olga takes a 13-minute break.

### Step 4: Calculate the time to sauté the clams
Olga can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes. 

To find out how long it takes to sauté 150 clams, we first determine how many batches of 30 clams are in 150 clams:
\[
\text{Number of batches} = \frac{150 \text{ clams}}{30 \text{ clams/batch}} = 5 \text{ batches}
\]

Now, calculate the total time to sauté 150 clams:
\[
\text{Time to sauté} = 5 \text{ batches} \times 19 \text{ minutes/batch} = 95 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 5: Total time calculation
Now, we sum all the times:
- Time to wash: 30 minutes
- Time to peel: 25 minutes
- Break time: 13 minutes
- Time to sauté: 95 minutes

Total time:
\[
\text{Total time} = 30 + 25 + 13 + 95 = 163 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it will take Olga a total of **163 minutes** to wash, peel, take a break, and sauté 150 clams.",150.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the time to wash 150 clams:**
   - It takes 12 seconds to wash each clam.
   - For 150 clams, the total washing time is:
     \[
     150 \text{ clams} \times 12 \text{ seconds/clam} = 1800 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Convert seconds to minutes:
     \[
     1800 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time to peel 150 clams:**
   - Olga can peel 6 clams per minute.
   - The time to peel 150 clams is:
     \[
     150 \text{ clams} \div 6 \text{ clams/minute} = 25 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Add the washing and peeling time:**
   - Total time for washing and peeling is:
     \[
     30 \text{ minutes (washing)} + 25 \text{ minutes (peeling)} = 55 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Add the break time after peeling:**
   - After peeling, Olga takes a 13-minute break.
   - So, the total time now is:
     \[
     55 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 68 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Calculate the time to sauté 150 clams:**
   - It takes 19 minutes to sauté 30 clams.
   - To find the time to sauté 150 clams, we first find how many batches of 30 clams are in 150 clams:
     \[
     150 \text{ clams} \div 30 \text{ clams/batch} = 5 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - The total sautéing time is:
     \[
     5 \text{ batches} \times 19 \text{ minutes/batch} = 95 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Add the sautéing time to the total time:**
   - The final total time is:
     \[
     68 \text{ minutes (washing, peeling, and break)} + 95 \text{ minutes (sautéing)} = 163 \text{ minutes}

He is going to sell each box for $8. How much is Andre going to make?",408.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Pineapples picked on each day:**
   - Saturday: 177 pineapples
   - Sunday: 183 pineapples
   - Monday: Double the amount picked on Saturday:
     \[
     \text{Monday's pineapples} = 2 \times 177 = 354 \text{ pineapples}
     \]

2. **Total pineapples picked from Saturday to Monday:**
   \[
   \text{Total for Saturday, Sunday, and Monday} = 177 + 183 + 354

   Let's calculate that:
   \[
   177 + 183 = 360
   \]
   \[
   360 + 354 = 714
   \]
   So, Andre picked a total of 714 pineapples from Saturday to Monday.

3. **Pineapples picked on Tuesday:**
   - Tuesday: Half of the total picked in the past 3 days:
   \[
   \text{Tuesday's pineapples} = \frac{714}{2} = 357 \text{ pineapples}

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 50% for the second half. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?",1755.0,"To find out how many pizzas the family eats in two months, we will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the daily pizza consumption of each family member.

- Uncle: 10 pizzas/day
- Spouse: 20 pizzas/day

**Total for Uncle and Spouse:**
\[
10 + 20 = 30 \text{ pizzas/day}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the grandchild's pizza consumption.

The grandchild eats two-fourths (which is equivalent to one-half) of the combined number of pizzas eaten by the uncle and spouse.

**Grandchild's consumption:**
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ pizzas/day}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total daily pizza consumption for the family.

**Total family consumption:**
\[
30 + 15 = 45 \text{ pizzas/day}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total consumption for the first month.

There are 30 days in a month, so the total consumption for the first month is:
\[
45 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 1350 \text{ pizzas}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the consumption for the second month.

#### First half of the second month (15 days):

They reduce their consumption by 60%. 

**New daily consumption:**
\[
45 \text{ pizzas/day} \times (1 - 0.60) = 45 \times 0.40 = 18 \text{ pizzas/day}

**Total for the first half of the second month:**
\[
18 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 270 \text{ pizzas}
\]

#### Second half of the second month (15 days):

They further reduce their consumption by 50% from the already reduced amount.

**New daily consumption:**
\[
18 \text{ pizzas/day} \times (1 - 0.50) = 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \text{ pizzas/day}

   \frac{24}{2} = 12
   \]
5. Now, we subtract 2 from this amount:
   \[
   12 - 2 = 10 \text{ emails he can respond to each day}
   \]
6. In a 6-day work week, without overtime, the total number of emails he responds to is:
   \[
   10 \text{ emails/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ emails}
   \]
7. On the last day, Mohammed works overtime and can respond to 10% more emails than usual. First, we calculate 10% of 10:
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } 10 = 0.10 \times 10 = 1 \text{ email}
   \]
8. Therefore, on the last day, he responds to:
   \[
   10 + 1 = 11 \text{ emails}
   \]
9. Now, we need to adjust the total for the last day. Since he normally responds to 10 emails on that day, we replace that with 11:
   \[
   \text{Total emails responded to in 6 days} = 60 - 10 + 11 = 61

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Ananya walks 24 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 miles of walking on the beach and 14 miles of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?",85.0,"To solve the problem, we need to determine Ananya's walking speeds on the beach and sidewalk, and then calculate the total time taken for her 24-mile walk.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( r \) be Ananya's original speed on the beach (in miles per minute).
   - Then her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2r \) (since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk).

2. **Injury Impact:**
   - After her injury, her speed on the beach becomes \( \frac{r}{2} \).
   - Her speed on the sidewalk becomes \( \frac{2r}{2} = r \).

3. **Time Spent on the Beach:**
   - We know that Ananya spends 50 minutes walking on the beach.
   - The distance she walks on the beach is 10 miles.
   - Using the formula \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \), we can express this as:
     \[
     10 = \left(\frac{r}{2}\right) \times 50
     \]
   - Solving for \( r \):
     \[
     10 = 25r \implies r = \frac{10}{25} = \frac{2}{5} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

4. **Calculate Speeds:**
   - Speed on the beach after injury: \( \frac{r}{2} = \frac{2/5}{2} = \frac{1}{5} \text{ miles per minute} \)
   - Speed on the sidewalk after injury: \( r = \frac{2}{5} \text{ miles per minute} \)

5. **Time Spent on the Sidewalk:**
   - The distance Ananya walks on the sidewalk is 14 miles.
   - Using the speed on the sidewalk, we can find the time spent walking on the sidewalk:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{14}{\frac{2}{5}} = 14 \times \frac{5}{2} = 35 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Total Time for the Walk:**
   - The total time for the entire 24-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = \text{Time on Beach} + \text{Time on Sidewalk} = 50 + 35 = 85 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Ananya to complete her 24-mile walk is \( \boxed{85} \) minutes.",85.0,1,"A: Let's think step by step.

1. Ananya walks a total of 24 miles every day, which includes 10 miles on the beach and 14 miles on the sidewalk.

2. We know that Ananya spends 50 minutes walking on the beach. 

3. Since she walks at a speed on the sidewalk that is twice her speed on the beach, let's denote her original speed on the beach as \( v \). Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v \).

4. Due to her injury, her speed on the beach is now \( \frac{v}{2} \) and her speed on the sidewalk is \( \frac{2v}{2} = v \).

5. To find the time spent walking on the beach, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   For the beach:
   \[
   50 \text{ minutes} = \frac{10 \text{ miles}}{\frac{v}{2}}
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   50 = \frac{10 \times 2}{v} \implies 50 = \frac{20}{v} \implies v = \frac{20}{50} = \frac{2}{5} \text{ miles per minute}
   \]

6. Now, we can find Ananya's speed on the sidewalk:
   \[
   \text{Speed on sidewalk} = v = \frac{2}{5} \text{ miles per minute}
   \]

7. Next, we calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk:
   \[
   \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{14 \text{ miles}}{\frac{2}{5} \text{ miles per minute}} = 14 \times \frac{5}{2} = 35 \text{ minutes}
   \]

8. Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time for the 24-mile walk:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 50 \text{ minutes} + 35 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes}

4. **Cookies found by Elena**: Elena finds 5 cookies.
   \[
   \text{Elena's cookies} = 5
   \]

5. **Cookies found by Mei**: Mei finds twice as many as Elena.
   \[
   \text{Mei's cookies} = 2 \times 5 = 10

8. **Cookies found by Umar**: Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined.
   - First, calculate the total cookies found by Mei and Elena:
   \[
   \text{Mei's cookies} + \text{Elena's cookies} = 10 + 5 = 15

5. Mei finds twice as many cookies as Elena:
   \[
   \text{Mei's cookies} = 2 \times 5 = 10

7. Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier:
   \[
   \text{Mohammed's cookies} = \frac{8}{8} = 1

8. Now, we calculate how many cookies Mei and Elena have combined:
   \[
   \text{Mei's cookies} + \text{Elena's cookies} = 10 + 5 = 15

   Therefore, Umar finds:
   \[
   \text{Umar's cookies} = 15 + 24 = 39

If they work for 8 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?",50.0,"To find out what percentage of the janitor's day is spent cleaning rooms, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the time taken to clean one room after the injury:**
   - Originally, it took 6 minutes per room.
   - Now, it takes twice as long: 
     \[
     6 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 12 \text{ minutes per room}

   2400 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 40 hours.
5. The janitor works for 8 hours a day. To find out how many days it will take to clean all the rooms, we divide the total hours by the hours worked per day:
   40 hours ÷ 8 hours/day = 5 days.
6. Now, we need to find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning rooms. Since they work for 8 hours a day and it takes them 8 hours to clean all the rooms, the percentage of their day spent cleaning is:
   (8 hours cleaning ÷ 8 hours total) * 100% = 100%.

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Noah is popping popcorn for a snack. As the skillet of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 70 pop in the first 10 seconds of cooking, then 2 times that amount in the next 10 seconds. The kernels increase to 4 times the initial popping rate in the next 10 seconds. In the final 10 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 10 seconds. After Noah takes the skillet off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. Noah gives one-fifth of the made popcorn to his brother Luca. How many more pieces of popcorn does Noah have to eat than his brother?",399.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Popping in the first 10 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels popped = 70

2. **Popping in the second 10 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels popped = 2 times the first 10 seconds = \(2 \times 70 = 140\)

3. **Popping in the third 10 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels popped = 4 times the first 10 seconds = \(4 \times 70 = 280\)

4. **Popping in the fourth 10 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels popped = half the rate of the previous 10 seconds = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 280 = 140\)

5. **Total kernels popped during the cooking:**
   - Total = \(70 + 140 + 280 + 140\)
   - Total = \(630\)

6. **Kernels that pop from residual heat:**
   - Number of kernels popped from residual heat = a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 140 = 35\)

7. **Total kernels popped (including residual heat):**
   - Total = \(630 + 35 = 665\)

8. **Popcorn given to Luca:**
   - Number of kernels given to Luca = one-fifth of the total = \(\frac{1}{5} \times 665 = 133\) (since \(665 \div 5 = 133\))

9. **Kernels Noah has left:**
   - Number of kernels Noah has = Total - Kernels given to Luca = \(665 - 133 = 532\)

10. **Difference in the number of kernels:**
    - Difference = Kernels Noah has - Kernels Luca has = \(532 - 133 = 399\)

Thus, Noah has **399 more pieces of popcorn** to eat than his brother Luca.",399.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. In the first 10 seconds, 70 kernels pop.
2. In the next 10 seconds, the amount that pops is 2 times the first amount:
   - 2 * 70 = 140 kernels.
3. In the following 10 seconds, the popping rate increases to 4 times the initial rate:
   - 4 * 70 = 280 kernels.
4. In the final 10 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate of the previous 10 seconds:
   - Half of 280 = 280 / 2 = 140 kernels.
5. Now, let's calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the cooking:
   - Total = 70 + 140 + 280 + 140 = 630 kernels.
6. After cooking, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds also pop from the residual heat:
   - A quarter of 140 = 140 / 4 = 35 kernels.
7. Now, let's find the total number of kernels that popped including the residual heat:
   - Total kernels = 630 + 35 = 665 kernels.
8. Noah gives one-fifth of the made popcorn to his brother Luca:
   - One-fifth of 665 = 665 / 5 = 133 kernels.
9. To find out how many more pieces of popcorn Noah has than his brother, we subtract the number of kernels Luca has from the total:
   - Noah's popcorn = 665 - 133 = 532 kernels.
10. Now, we calculate how many more pieces Noah has than Luca:
    - Difference = 532 - 133 = 399 kernels.

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"A building is made out of 5 white bricks, twice as many orange bricks, and an unknown number of green bricks. If there are 30 bricks in the building in total, what percentage of bricks are green?",50.0,"To find the percentage of green bricks in the building, we first need to determine the number of each type of brick.

1. **Identify the number of white bricks:**
   - There are 5 white bricks.

2. **Determine the number of orange bricks:**
   - The problem states there are twice as many orange bricks as white bricks. Therefore, the number of orange bricks is:
     \[
     2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ orange bricks}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of bricks accounted for:**
   - We have:
     - White bricks: 5
     - Orange bricks: 10
   - Adding these together gives:
     \[
     5 + 10 = 15 \text{ bricks}
     \]

4. **Find the number of green bricks:**
   - The total number of bricks in the building is 30. To find the number of green bricks, we subtract the number of white and orange bricks from the total:
     \[
     30 - 15 = 15 \text{ green bricks}
     \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of green bricks:**
   - The percentage of green bricks is calculated by dividing the number of green bricks by the total number of bricks and then multiplying by 100:
     \[
     \text{Percentage of green bricks} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     \frac{15}{30} = 0.5
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
     \]

Thus, the percentage of bricks that are green is \( \boxed{50\%} \).",50.0,1,"Let's think step by step.  
1. The building has 5 white bricks.  
2. It has twice as many orange bricks as white bricks, so the number of orange bricks is 2 * 5 = 10.  
3. Now, we can find the total number of white and orange bricks: 5 (white) + 10 (orange) = 15 bricks.  
4. The total number of bricks in the building is 30.  
5. To find the number of green bricks, we subtract the number of white and orange bricks from the total: 30 - 15 = 15 green bricks.  
6. Now, we need to find the percentage of green bricks. The formula for percentage is (part/whole) * 100. Here, the part is the number of green bricks (15) and the whole is the total number of bricks (30).  
7. So, the percentage of green bricks is (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.

Olivia, who is younger than Bodhi but older than Keisha, will be 42 in 7 years. How much younger is Keisha than the average age of all three?",18.0,"Let's denote the current ages of Olivia, Bodhi, and Keisha as \( O \), \( B \), and \( K \) respectively.

1. **Determine Olivia's current age**:
   Since Olivia will be 42 in 7 years, we can calculate her current age:
   \[
   O + 7 = 42 \implies O = 42 - 7 = 35
   \]

2. **Determine Bodhi's current age**:
   We know that Olivia and Bodhi are currently 24 years apart in age. Since Olivia is younger than Bodhi, we have:
   \[
   B - O = 24 \implies B - 35 = 24 \implies B = 24 + 35 = 59
   \]

3. **Determine Keisha's current age**:
   We also know that Olivia and Keisha are currently 15 years apart in age, and since Olivia is older than Keisha, we have:
   \[
   O - K = 15 \implies 35 - K = 15 \implies K = 35 - 15 = 20

4. **Calculate the average age of all three**:
   Now we can find the average age of Olivia, Bodhi, and Keisha:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{O + B + K}{3} = \frac{35 + 59 + 20}{3} = \frac{114}{3} = 38

Thus, Keisha is **18 years younger** than the average age of all three.",18.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine Olivia's current age**: 
   - In 7 years, Olivia will be 42 years old. 
   - Therefore, her current age is 42 - 7 = 35 years old.

2. **Determine Bodhi's current age**: 
   - Olivia is currently 24 years younger than Bodhi. 
   - So, Bodhi's current age is 35 + 24 = 59 years old.

3. **Determine Keisha's current age**: 
   - Olivia is currently 15 years older than Keisha. 
   - Therefore, Keisha's current age is 35 - 15 = 20 years old.

4. **Calculate the average age of Olivia, Bodhi, and Keisha**: 
   - The total age of all three is 35 (Olivia) + 59 (Bodhi) + 20 (Keisha) = 114 years.
