If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 10 hours if she spends 2/5 of the time running, 1/2 of the time skipping, and the remaining of the time walking?",27.0,"To solve the problem, we first need to determine Mei's walking, running, and skipping speeds based on the information provided.

1. **Determine Mei's skipping speed**:
   - We know that Mei can skip at a speed of 2 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Mei's running speed**:
   - It is given that she can skip at a rate that is 1/2 as fast as she can run. Therefore, if her skipping speed is 2 miles per hour, her running speed can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

3. **Determine Mei's walking speed**:
   - It is stated that Mei can run four times faster than she can walk. Thus, we can find her walking speed:
   \[
   \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

Now we have the following speeds:
- Walking speed: 1 mile per hour
- Running speed: 4 miles per hour
- Skipping speed: 2 miles per hour

4. **Determine the time spent on each activity**:
   - The total time is 10 hours.
   - Time spent running: 
   \[
   \text{Time running} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10 = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]
   - Time spent skipping:
   \[
   \text{Time skipping} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]
   - Time spent walking:
   \[
   \text{Time walking} = 10 - \left(4 + 5\right) = 10 - 9 = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

5. **Calculate the distance traveled in each activity**:
   - Distance running:
   \[
   \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 4 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
   \]
   - Distance skipping:
   \[
   \text{Distance skipping} = \text{Skipping speed} \times \text{Time skipping} = 2 \text{ miles per hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ miles}
   \]

If the city is 18 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/3 of the city?",82.0,"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover 1/3 of the city, we first need to find out how far 1/3 of the city is in miles.

The city is 18 miles across, so:

\[
\text{Distance for } \frac{1}{3} \text{ of the city} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we know that the fog bank covers 3 miles in 41 minutes. To find out how long it takes to cover 1 mile, we can set up a proportion:

\[
\text{Time to cover 3 miles} = 41 \text{ minutes}
\]

To find the time to cover 1 mile, we divide the time by 3:

\[
\text{Time to cover 1 mile} = \frac{41 \text{ minutes}}{3} \approx 13.67 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we can calculate the time to cover 6 miles:

\[
\text{Time to cover 6 miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \times 13.67 \text{ minutes/mile} \approx 82 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it will take approximately 82 minutes for the fog bank to cover 1/3 of the city.

The city is 18 miles across.  
To find out how long it takes for the fog bank to cover 1/3 of the city, we first need to calculate how many miles that is.  
1/3 of 18 miles is:  
18 miles / 3 = 6 miles.  

Next, we know that it takes 41 minutes to cover every 3 miles.  
Now, we need to determine how many 3-mile segments are in 6 miles:  
6 miles / 3 miles = 2 segments.  

Since it takes 41 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, we multiply the number of segments by the time it takes to cover one segment:  
2 segments * 41 minutes/segment = 82 minutes.

On Wednesday, he got to stay up late, so he watched two 5-hour episodes. On Thursday, he watched four episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 24 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?",5.0,"To find out how many 15-minute episodes Noah watched on Monday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he spent watching TV from Saturday to Thursday, and then determine how much time was left for Monday.

1. **Saturday and Sunday:**
   - He watched 4 hours each night for 2 nights.
   - Total time for Saturday and Sunday:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Tuesday:**
   - He watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show.
   - Convert 45 minutes to hours:
     \[
     45 \text{ minutes} = \frac{45}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.75 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Total time for Tuesday:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} + 0.75 \text{ hours} = 3.75 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   - He watched two 5-hour episodes.
   - Total time for Wednesday:
     \[
     5 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Thursday:**
   - He watched four 15-minute episodes.
   - Convert 15 minutes to hours:
     \[
     15 \text{ minutes} = \frac{15}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.25 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Total time for Thursday:
     \[
     4 \times 0.25 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
     \]

5. **Total time from Saturday to Thursday:**
   - Now we sum the time from all the days:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours (Saturday and Sunday)} + 3.75 \text{ hours (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ hours (Wednesday)} + 1 \text{ hour (Thursday)} = 22.75 \text{ hours}
     \]

6. **Total time watched:**
   - Noah watched a total of 24 hours of TV.
   - Therefore, the time he spent watching TV on Monday is:
     \[
     24 \text{ hours} - 22.75 \text{ hours} = 1.25 \text{ hours}
     \]

7. **Convert 1.25 hours to minutes:**
   - Convert hours to minutes:
     \[
     1.25 \text{ hours} = 1.25 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ minutes}
     \]

8. **Determine the number of 15-minute episodes:**
   - Each episode is 15 minutes long, so the number of episodes he watched on Monday is:
     \[
     \frac{75 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes per episode}} = 5 \text{ episodes}
     \]

Thus, Noah watched **5 episodes** of the 15-minute show on Monday.",15.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Total TV time**: Noah watched a total of 24 hours of TV.

2. **Saturday and Sunday**: He watched 4-hour episodes each night for two nights.
   - Total for Saturday and Sunday = 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours.

3. **Monday**: He watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. We will denote the number of 15-minute episodes he watched as \( x \).
   - Each 15-minute episode is \( \frac{15}{60} = 0.25 \) hours.
   - So, the total time spent on Monday = \( 0.25x \) hours.

4. **Tuesday**: He watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show.
   - 45 minutes is \( \frac{45}{60} = 0.75 \) hours.
   - Total for Tuesday = 3 hours + 0.75 hours = 3.75 hours.

5. **Wednesday**: He watched two 5-hour episodes.
   - Total for Wednesday = 5 hours + 5 hours = 10 hours.

6. **Thursday**: He watched four episodes, each 15 minutes.
   - Total for Thursday = 4 episodes * 0.25 hours/episode = 1 hour.

7. **Now, we can set up the equation** for the total TV time:
   \[
   8 \text{ (Saturday and Sunday)} + 0.25x \text{ (Monday)} + 3.75 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1 \text{ (Thursday)} = 24

If she used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.",504.0,"To solve the problem, we need to break down the information given and set up equations based on the ratios provided.

1. **Understanding the Ratios**:
   - The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 63:14.
   - The ratio of tablespoons of milk to cups of water is 9:7.

2. **Let’s define variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of cups of water used.
   - From the ratio of sugar to water, the amount of sugar used can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{sugar} = \frac{63}{14} \cdot x = \frac{63x}{14} = 4.5x
     \]
   - From the ratio of milk to water, the amount of milk used can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{milk} = \frac{9}{7} \cdot x
     \]

3. **Total Ingredients**:
   - The total amount of ingredients used is given as 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk:
     \[
     \text{sugar} + \text{water} + \text{milk} = 760
     \]
   - Substituting the expressions for sugar and milk:
     \[
     4.5x + x + \frac{9}{7}x = 760
     \]

4. **Combining Terms**:
   - First, combine the terms involving \( x \):
     \[
     4.5x + x = 5.5x
     \]
   - Now, we need to combine \( 5.5x \) and \( \frac{9}{7}x \):
     - To combine these, we can convert \( 5.5 \) to a fraction:
       \[
       5.5 = \frac{11}{2}
       \]
     - Now, we find a common denominator to combine \( \frac{11}{2}x \) and \( \frac{9}{7}x \):
       - The least common multiple of 2 and 7 is 14.
       - Convert \( \frac{11}{2} \) to have a denominator of 14:
         \[
         \frac{11}{2} = \frac{11 \times 7}{2 \times 7} = \frac{77}{14}
         \]
       - Convert \( \frac{9}{7} \) to have a denominator of 14:
         \[
         \frac{9}{7} = \frac{9 \times 2}{7 \times 2} = \frac{18}{14}
         \]
     - Now we can combine:
       \[
       \frac{77}{14}x + \frac{18}{14}x = \frac{95}{14}x
       \]

5. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - Now we have:
     \[
     \frac{95}{14}x = 760
     \]

6. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - Multiply both sides by 14 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     95x = 760 \times 14
     \]
   - Calculate \( 760 \times 14 \):
     \[
     760 \times 14 = 10640
     \]
   - Now divide by 95:
     \[
     x = \frac{10640}{95} = 112
     \]

7. **Calculating the Amount of Sugar**:
   - Now that we have \( x = 112 \) (the number of cups of water), we can find the amount of sugar:
     \[
     \text{sugar} = 4.5x = 4.5 \times 112 = 504
     \]

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Fatima used is \( \boxed{504} \).",504.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Understanding the ratios**: Fatima uses sugar and water in the ratio of 63:14. This means for every 63 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 14 cups of water.

2. **Finding the total parts in the sugar and water ratio**: 
   - The total parts in the ratio of sugar to water is 63 + 14 = 77 parts.

3. **Finding the total amount of sugar and water used**: 
   - Let \( x \) be the number of times the ratio is repeated. 
   - The total amount of sugar used is \( 63x \) teaspoons.
   - The total amount of water used is \( 14x \) cups.

4. **Understanding the milk ratio**: Fatima uses 9 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water. 

5. **Finding the total parts in the milk ratio**: 
   - The total parts in the ratio of milk to water is 9 + 7 = 16 parts.

6. **Finding the total amount of milk used**: 
   - Since she uses 14 cups of water, we can find how many times the milk ratio is repeated. 
   - The number of times the milk ratio is repeated is \( \frac{14}{7} = 2 \).
   - Therefore, the total amount of milk used is \( 9 \times 2 = 18 \) tablespoons.

7. **Setting up the equation for total ingredients**: 
   - The total amount of ingredients used is the sum of sugar, water, and milk:
   \[
   63x + 14x + 18 = 760
   \]

8. **Combining like terms**: 
   - This simplifies to:
   \[
   77x + 18 = 760
   \]

9. **Solving for \( x \)**: 
   - Subtract 18 from both sides:
   \[
   77x = 760 - 18
   \]
   \[
   77x = 742
   \]
   - Now divide by 77:
   \[
   x = \frac{742}{77} = 9.64 \text{ (approximately)}
   \]

10. **Calculating the amount of sugar used**: 
    - Now we can find the total teaspoons of sugar used:
    \[
    \text{Teaspoons of sugar} = 63x = 63 \times 9.64 \approx 607.32
    \]

Since we are looking for the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used, we round to the nearest whole number.

The answer is approximately 607 teaspoons of sugar.",607.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. We know that Fatima uses sugar and water in the ratio of 63:14. This means for every 63 teaspoons of sugar, there are 14 cups of water.

2. We also know that she uses 9 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water. 

3. First, let's convert the total amount of ingredients used (760) into parts based on the ratios. The total parts in the sugar and water ratio is 63 + 14 = 77 parts.

4. Now, we need to find out how many parts correspond to the total of 760 teaspoons. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Total parts} = 77 \text{ parts}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 760 \text{ teaspoons}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value of one part} = \frac{760}{77} \approx 9.87 \text{ teaspoons}
   \]

5. Now, we can find the amount of sugar used. Since sugar corresponds to 63 parts:
   \[
   \text{Teaspoons of sugar} = 63 \times 9.87 \approx 622.81 \text{ teaspoons}
   \]

6. However, we need to ensure that the total of sugar, water, and milk equals 760. We will calculate the total amount of water and milk used based on the ratios.

7. For water (14 parts):
   \[
   \text{Teaspoons of water} = 14 \times 9.87 \approx 138.18 \text{ teaspoons}
   \]

8. For milk (9 tablespoons for every 7 cups of water), we need to convert tablespoons to teaspoons (1 tablespoon = 3 teaspoons):
   \[
   \text{Teaspoons of milk} = 9 \times 3 = 27 \text{ teaspoons}
   \]

9. Now, let's add the amounts:
   \[
   \text{Total} = 622.81 + 138.18 + 27 \approx 788.99 \text{ teaspoons}
   \]
   This exceeds 760, indicating an error in the calculations.

10. Let's recalculate the parts based on the total of 760:
   - Total parts = 63 (sugar) + 14 (water) + 9 (milk converted to parts) = 86 parts.
   - Value of one part = \( \frac{760}{86} \approx 8.84 \text{ teaspoons} \).

11. Now, we can find the correct amount of sugar:
   \[
   \text{Teaspoons of sugar} = 63 \times 8.84 \approx 556.92 \text{ teaspoons}
   \]

12. Finally, rounding to the nearest whole number, we find that Fatima used approximately 557 teaspoons of sugar.

On average, how many LinkedIn friends do Fatima, Noah, and Jasmine have?",54.0,"To find the average number of LinkedIn friends that Fatima, Noah, and Jasmine have, we first need to determine how many friends Noah and Jasmine have based on the information given.

1. **Determine Noah's number of friends:**
   Fatima has six times as many friends as Noah. We know that Fatima has 108 friends. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   F = 6N
   \]
   where \( F \) is the number of friends Fatima has and \( N \) is the number of friends Noah has. Substituting the known value:
   \[
   108 = 6N

Thus, Arjun spent **₣117.00** on everything after the discount.",117.0,1,"A: Let's think step by step.

1. First, we calculate the total cost of the notebooks.
   - Arjun bought 12 notebooks at ₣2.75 each.
   - Total cost for notebooks = 12 * 2.75 = ₣33.00.

2. Next, we calculate the total cost of the rulers.
   - He bought 6 rulers at ₣9.00 each.
   - Total cost for rulers = 6 * 9.00 = ₣54.00.

3. Now, we calculate the cost of the rim of bond paper.
   - The cost of the rim of bond paper is ₣10.00.

4. Then, we calculate the total cost of the crayons.
   - He bought 3 crayons at ₣11.00 each.
   - Total cost for crayons = 3 * 11.00 = ₣33.00.

5. Now, we add all these costs together to find the total before discount.
   - Total cost = Cost of notebooks + Cost of rulers + Cost of bond paper + Cost of crayons
   - Total cost = ₣33.00 + ₣54.00 + ₣10.00 + ₣33.00 = ₣130.00.

6. Next, we calculate the discount.
   - The discount is 10% of the total cost.
   - Discount = 10% of ₣130.00 = 0.10 * 130 = ₣13.00.

7. Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount spent.
   - Final amount spent = Total cost - Discount
   - Final amount spent = ₣130.00 - ₣13.00 = ₣117.00.

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,Luis is rolling a 20-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row?,43.75,"To solve the problem, we need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 on a 20-sided die, and the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 10:**
   A 20-sided die has the numbers 1 through 20. The numbers greater than 10 are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. 

   There are 10 numbers greater than 10. Therefore, the probability \( P(\text{greater than 10}) \) is:
   \[
   P(\text{greater than 10}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
   \]

2. **Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row:**
   The odd numbers on a 20-sided die are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19. There are 10 odd numbers.

   The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is:
   \[
   P(\text{odd}) = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
   \]

   Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row is:
   \[
   P(\text{four odd numbers}) = P(\text{odd})^4 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16}
   \]

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   Now we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 10 compared to rolling four odd numbers in a row. We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Difference in probabilities} = P(\text{greater than 10}) - P(\text{four odd numbers}) = 0.5 - \frac{1}{16}
   \]

   To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The common denominator of 1 and 16 is 16:
   \[
   0.5 = \frac{8}{16}
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \frac{8}{16} - \frac{1}{16} = \frac{7}{16}
   \]

4. **Expressing the difference as a percentage:**
   To express \(\frac{7}{16}\) as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
   \[
   \frac{7}{16} \times 100 = 43.75\%

   - The probability of rolling an odd number on one roll is:
     \[

He can write a page every 14 minutes. On average, how many hours does Yuki spend writing in a day?",4.0,"To find out how many hours Yuki spends writing in a day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Yuki is still in contact with:**
   - Yuki originally had 8 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 4 of them.
   - Therefore, the number of pen pals he still has is:
     \[
     8 - 4 = 4
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of letters sent per week:**
   - Each pen pal sends 3 letters a week.
   - With 4 pen pals, the total number of letters sent per week is:
     \[
     4 \text{ pen pals} \times 3 \text{ letters/pen pal} = 12 \text{ letters/week}

   - Difference = $535,000 - $470,000 = $65,000.

The answer is $65,000.",65000.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The selling price of the property is $500,000.
2. Ms. Johnson can get a 10% discount on the selling price.
   - The discount amount is 10% of $500,000, which is calculated as:
     \[
     0.10 \times 500,000 = 50,000
     \]
   - Therefore, the discounted price is:
     \[
     500,000 - 50,000 = 450,000

3. Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee, which is 4% of the selling price:
   - The brokerage fee is:
     \[
     0.04 \times 500,000 = 20,000
     \]

4. Now, we calculate the transfer fee, which is 13% of the selling price:
   - The transfer fee is:
     \[
     0.13 \times 500,000 = 65,000

If there are three times the number of boys in the playground, what percentage of the kids in the playground are girls?",25.0,"To find the percentage of kids in the playground that are girls, we first need to determine the total number of kids, which includes both girls and boys.

1. **Identify the number of girls**: 
   There are 15 girls in the playground.

2. **Determine the number of boys**: 
   According to the problem, there are three times the number of boys as there are girls. Therefore, the number of boys is:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 3 \times \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 15 = 45
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of kids**: 
   The total number of kids in the playground is the sum of the number of girls and boys:
   \[
   \text{Total number of kids} = \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of boys} = 15 + 45 = 60
   \]

4. **Calculate the percentage of kids that are girls**: 
   The percentage of kids that are girls is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of girls} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of girls}}{\text{Total number of kids}} \right) \times 100

1. Ananya starts with $1200.
2. She buys 23 kgs of saltwater taffy. The price is structured as follows:
   - For the first 16 kgs, the cost is 16 kgs * $23/kg = $368.
   - For the next 4 kgs, she gets them at half price. The price for 4 kgs at half price is:
     - Regular price for 4 kgs = 4 kgs * $23/kg = $92.
     - Half price = $92 / 2 = $46.
   - For the remaining 3 kgs, the cost is 3 kgs * $23/kg = $69.
   - So, the total cost for the taffy is $368 + $46 + $69 = $483.

3. Next, Ananya buys a mixed bag of starfish for $11.0.

4. Then, she buys 17 keychains at $20.0 each. The total cost for the keychains is:

If the length of his room is 16 feet longer that its width, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?",68.0,"Let the width of Kai's office be denoted as \( w \) feet. According to the problem, the length \( l \) of the office is 16 feet longer than the width, so we can express the length as:

\[
l = w + 16
\]

The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[
A = l \times w
\]

We know the area of Kai's office is 225 square feet, so we can set up the equation:

\[
w \times (w + 16) = 225
\]

Expanding this equation gives:

\[
w^2 + 16w = 225
\]

To solve for \( w \), we rearrange the equation:

\[
w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0
\]

Next, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for \( w \). The quadratic formula is given by:

\[
w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

In our equation, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 16 \), and \( c = -225 \). Plugging in these values:

\[
w = \frac{-16 \pm \sqrt{16^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-225)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]

Calculating the discriminant:

\[
16^2 = 256
\]
\[
-4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-225) = 900
\]
\[
b^2 - 4ac = 256 + 900 = 1156
\]

Now, taking the square root:

\[
\sqrt{1156} = 34
\]

Substituting back into the quadratic formula:

\[
w = \frac{-16 \pm 34}{2}
\]

Calculating the two possible values for \( w \):

1. \( w = \frac{-16 + 34}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
2. \( w = \frac{-16 - 34}{2} = \frac{-50}{2} = -25 \) (not a valid solution since width cannot be negative)

Thus, the width \( w \) is 9 feet. Now we can find the length \( l \):

\[
l = w + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we can calculate the perimeter \( P \) of the rectangle using the formula:

\[
P = 2l + 2w
\]

Substituting the values of \( l \) and \( w \):

\[
P = 2(25) + 2(9) = 50 + 18 = 68 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, the perimeter of Kai's office is:

\[

4. Expanding this equation gives:
   \[
   w^2 + 16w = 225
   \]
5. Rearranging the equation to set it to zero:
   \[
   w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0
   \]
6. Now, we can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
   \[
   w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 16 \), and \( c = -225 \).
7. First, we calculate the discriminant:

   This gives us two possible solutions:
   \[
   w = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \quad \text{and} \quad w = \frac{-50}{2} = -25

   - So, Yuki has \( 10 \times \frac{1}{2} = 5 \) tubes of pink paint.

2. **Determine how many tubes of blue paint Yuki has:**
   - Sanjay has 3 tubes of blue paint.
   - Yuki has three times as many tubes of blue paint as Sanjay.
   - So, Yuki has \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) tubes of blue paint.

3. **Calculate the total number of pink tubes for Sanjay and Yuki:**
   - Sanjay has 10 tubes of pink paint.
   - Yuki has 5 tubes of pink paint.
   - The total number of pink tubes is \( 10 + 5 = 15 \).

4. **Determine how many tubes of black paint Andre has:**
   - Andre has six times as many tubes of black paint as the combined number of pink tubes that Sanjay and Yuki have.
   - So, Andre has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) tubes of black paint.

5. **Calculate the total number of blue tubes for Sanjay and Yuki:**
   - Sanjay has 3 tubes of blue paint.
   - Yuki has 9 tubes of blue paint.
   - The total number of blue tubes is \( 3 + 9 = 12 \).

6. **Determine how many tubes of white paint Andre has:**
   - Andre has 6 fewer tubes of white paint than the combined number of blue tubes that Sanjay and Yuki have.
   - So, Andre has \( 12 - 6 = 6 \) tubes of white paint.

7. **Calculate the total number of tubes of paint Andre has:**
   - Andre has 90 tubes of black paint and 6 tubes of white paint.
   - The total number of tubes of paint Andre has is \( 90 + 6 = 96 \).

Deshawn has 615 crackers, 11 bowls and 4 plates. Deshawn then eats a third of the crackers. How many crackers won't he be able to place on the bowls or plates?",11.0,"To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the capacity of the plates**: 
   Each bowl can hold 21 crackers. Since each plate can hold two times that, we calculate the capacity of one plate:
   \[
   \text{Capacity of one plate} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ crackers}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and plates**:
   Deshawn has 11 bowls and 4 plates. We calculate the total capacity:
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of bowls} = 11 \times 21 = 231 \text{ crackers}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of plates} = 4 \times 42 = 168 \text{ crackers}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = 231 + 168 = 399 \text{ crackers}
   \]

3. **Determine how many crackers Deshawn has after eating**:
   Deshawn starts with 615 crackers and eats a third of them. First, we calculate how many crackers he eats:
   \[
   \text{Crackers eaten} = \frac{1}{3} \times 615 = 205 \text{ crackers}
   \]
   Now, we find out how many crackers he has left:
   \[
   \text{Crackers left} = 615 - 205 = 410 \text{ crackers}
   \]

4. **Determine how many crackers cannot be placed**:
   Now we need to see how many of the remaining crackers can be placed in the bowls and plates. Since the total capacity is 399 crackers, we compare this with the number of crackers he has left:
   \[
   \text{Crackers that cannot be placed} = 410 - 399 = 11 \text{ crackers}
   \]

Thus, the number of crackers that Deshawn won't be able to place on the bowls or plates is \(\boxed{11}\).",11.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and plates**:
   - Deshawn has 11 bowls, so the total capacity of the bowls is:
   \[
   11 \times 21 = 231 \text{ crackers}
   \]
   - Deshawn has 4 plates, so the total capacity of the plates is:
   \[
   4 \times 42 = 168 \text{ crackers}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total capacity of both bowls and plates**:
   \[
   231 + 168 = 399 \text{ crackers}

5. **Calculate the remaining crackers after eating**:
   \[
   615 - 205 = 410 \text{ crackers}

1. **Determine James's current age**: 
   James is currently 8 years old.

2. **Calculate James's age in 4 years**: 
   In 4 years, James will be:
   \[
   8 + 4 = 12 \text{ years old}

   4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ years old}
   \]
   So, in 4 years, Jasmine will be 32 years old.

4. **Calculate Jasmine's current age**: 
   Since Jasmine will be 32 years old in 4 years, we can find her current age by subtracting 4 years:

How many letters has Kayla written in total?",572.0,"To find out how many letters Kayla has written in total, we can break down her writing process step by step.

1. **Writing the alphabet five times:**
   The English alphabet has 26 letters. If Kayla writes the alphabet five times, the total number of letters written in this step is:
   \[
   5 \times 26 = 130

1. **Cold Water Swimming Time:**
   - Carlos swims 1 kilometer in 11 minutes.
   - Therefore, for 9 kilometers in cold water:
     \[
     \text{Time for 9 km in cold water} = 9 \text{ km} \times 11 \text{ minutes/km} = 99 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Warm Water Swimming Time:**
   - Carlos swims 1 kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times the time it takes in cold water.
   - The time taken in cold water for 1 kilometer is 11 minutes, so:
     \[
     \text{Time for 1 km in warm water} = 4 \times 11 \text{ minutes} + 9 \text{ minutes} = 44 \text{ minutes} + 9 \text{ minutes} = 53 \text{ minutes}

On average, how many pages does she have left to write per day?",11.0,"To find out how many pages Olga has left to write per day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pages she has already written**:
   Since Olga has completed \( \frac{3}{4} \) of her 176-page thesis, we can calculate the number of pages she has written as follows:
   \[
   \text{Pages written} = \frac{3}{4} \times 176
   \]
   \[
   \text{Pages written} = \frac{3 \times 176}{4} = \frac{528}{4} = 132
   \]

2. **Determine the number of pages left to write**:
   To find out how many pages she has left to write, we subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages:
   \[
   \text{Pages left} = 176 - 132 = 44
   \]

3. **Calculate the average number of pages she needs to write per day**:
   Olga has 4 days left to complete her thesis. We can find the average number of pages she needs to write each day by dividing the number of pages left by the number of days remaining:
   \[
   \text{Pages per day} = \frac{\text{Pages left}}{\text{Days left}} = \frac{44}{4} = 11
   \]

Thus, Olga needs to write an average of **11 pages per day** to complete her thesis on time.",11.0,1,"Let's think step by step.  
Olga's thesis is 176 pages long.  
She has finished writing 3/4 of the thesis.  
To find out how many pages she has already written, we calculate:

Now, we need to find out how many pages she has left to write.  
The number of pages left is:  
176 - 132 = 44 pages.  

Olga has 4 more days until the submission deadline.  
To find out how many pages she needs to write per day, we divide the number of pages left by the number of days:  
44 pages / 4 days = 11 pages per day.

He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 40% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of flour and he uses 3 kilograms of flour per day. He also decided to buy himself a bagel for ₣4. Since he shopped more than ₣50, he received a ₣23 discount. How much does Santiago have to pay?",275.0,"To find out how much Santiago has to pay, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive flour:**
   - The normal brand costs ₣10 per kilogram.
   - The more expensive brand costs 40% more than the normal brand.
   - To find the cost of the more expensive brand:
     \[
     \text{Cost of more expensive flour} = \text{Normal cost} + (0.40 \times \text{Normal cost}) = ₣10 + (0.40 \times ₣10) = ₣10 + ₣4 = ₣14 \text{ per kilogram}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of flour Santiago needs for a week:**
   - Santiago uses 3 kilograms of flour per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he needs:
     \[
     \text{Total flour needed} = 3 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ kg}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the flour:**
   - The total cost for 21 kilograms of the more expensive flour is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of flour} = 21 \text{ kg} \times ₣14/\text{kg} = ₣294
     \]

4. **Add the cost of the bagel:**
   - The cost of the bagel is ₣4.
   - Therefore, the total cost before any discounts is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost before discount} = ₣294 + ₣4 = ₣298
     \]

5. **Apply the discount:**
   - Santiago receives a discount of ₣23 because his total shopping was more than ₣50.
   - The total cost after the discount is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost after discount} = ₣298 - ₣23 = ₣275

1. Santiago uses 3 kilograms of flour per day.
2. He needs flour for a week, which is 7 days.

4. The normal brand of flour costs ₣10 per kilogram.
5. The more expensive brand costs 40% more than the normal brand.
6. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we calculate 40% of ₣10:
   - 40% of ₣10 = 0.40 * 10 = ₣4.
7. Therefore, the cost of the more expensive brand is:
   - ₣10 + ₣4 = ₣14 per kilogram.

8. Now, we calculate the total cost for 21 kg of the more expensive flour:
   - Total cost = 21 kg * ₣14/kg = ₣294.

9. Santiago also buys a bagel for ₣4.
10. So, the total cost including the bagel is:
    - Total cost = ₣294 + ₣4 = ₣298.

11. Since Santiago shopped more than ₣50, he receives a discount of ₣23.

   \]

Thus, Yuki is missing **¥181**.",181.0,1,"Let's think step by step.  
The total cost of the music festival is ¥490.  
Yuki has ¥15.  

First, we need to find out how much money the youth club will cover.  
The youth club covers a tenth of the cost:  
1/10 of ¥490 = ¥490 / 10 = ¥49.  

Next, we find out how much Yuki's friends will cover.  
His friends cover half of the cost:  
1/2 of ¥490 = ¥490 / 2 = ¥245.  

Now, let's calculate the total amount covered by the youth club and his friends:  
Total covered = Amount covered by youth club + Amount covered by friends  
Total covered = ¥49 + ¥245 = ¥294.  

Now, we add the amount Yuki has to the total covered:  
Total amount Yuki has = Amount Yuki has + Total covered  
Total amount Yuki has = ¥15 + ¥294 = ¥309.  

Finally, we need to find out how much money Yuki is missing:  
Missing amount = Total cost - Total amount Yuki has

   \[
   \text{Total grain for alpacas} = \text{Number of alpacas} \times \text{Grain per alpaca} = 7 \times 15 = 105 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. **Calculate the grain needed for the cows:**
   Each cow eats as much as a goat and an alpaca eat combined. 
   \[
   \text{Grain per cow} = \text{Grain per goat} + \text{Grain per alpaca} = 9 + 15 = 24 \text{ kg}
   \]
   Now, calculate the total grain for the cows:
   \[
   \text{Total grain for cows} = \text{Number of cows} \times \text{Grain per cow} = 21 \times 24 = 504 \text{ kg}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total grain needed:**
   Now, we sum the total grain needed for all types of livestock:
   \[
   \text{Total grain needed} = \text{Total grain for goats} + \text{Total grain for alpacas} + \text{Total grain for cows}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total grain needed} = 189 + 105 + 504 = 798 \text{ kg}
   \]

Thus, Alejandro needs a total of **798 kilograms** of grain.",798.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of grain needed for each goat:**
   Each goat needs 9 kilograms of grain.

2. **Calculate the amount of grain needed for each alpaca:**
   Each alpaca needs 3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs is 2 * 9 = 18 kilograms.
   - Therefore, each alpaca needs 18 - 3 = 15 kilograms of grain.

3. **Calculate the amount of grain needed for each cow:**
   Each cow eats as much as a goat and an alpaca eat combined.
   - The total amount for one cow is 9 (for the goat) + 15 (for the alpaca) = 24 kilograms.

4. **Calculate the total amount of grain needed for all goats:**
   There are 21 goats.
   - Total for goats = 21 * 9 = 189 kilograms.

5. **Calculate the total amount of grain needed for all alpacas:**
   There are 7 alpacas.
   - Total for alpacas = 7 * 15 = 105 kilograms.

Due to the flu season, 35 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.",50.0,"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of occupied beds**:
   The hospital has a total of 800 beds, and \( \frac{1}{8} \) of them are occupied.
   \[
   \text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{8} \times 800 = 100 \text{ beds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of beds out of service**:
   One-fifth of all the beds are out of service.
   \[
   \text{Out of service beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 800 = 160 \text{ beds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of beds that are either occupied or out of service**:
   \[
   \text{Total occupied or out of service} = \text{Occupied beds} + \text{Out of service beds} = 100 + 160 = 260 \text{ beds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of unoccupied beds**:
   The total number of unoccupied beds is the total number of beds minus the number of beds that are occupied or out of service.
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied beds} = \text{Total beds} - \text{Total occupied or out of service} = 800 - 260 = 540 \text{ beds}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks**:
   There are 35 patients admitted each day. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted is:
   \[
   \text{Total patients admitted} = 35 \times 14 = 490 \text{ patients}
   \]

6. **Calculate the new number of occupied beds after 2 weeks**:
   The new number of occupied beds will be the initial occupied beds plus the number of patients admitted.
   \[
   \text{New occupied beds} = \text{Initial occupied beds} + \text{Total patients admitted} = 100 + 490 = 590 \text{ beds}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks**:
   We need to consider the total number of beds and the new number of occupied beds to find the unoccupied beds.
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = \text{Total beds} - \text{New occupied beds} = 800 - 590 = 210 \text{ beds}
   \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is \( \boxed{210} \).",210.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The hospital has a total capacity of 800 beds.
2. First, we need to find out how many beds are occupied. Since 1/8 of the beds are occupied:
   \[
   \text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{8} \times 800 = 100 \text{ beds}
   \]

3. Next, we find out how many beds are out of service. One-fifth of all the beds are out of service:
   \[
   \text{Out of service beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 800 = 160 \text{ beds}
   \]

4. Now, we can calculate the total number of beds that are either occupied or out of service:
   \[
   \text{Total occupied and out of service beds} = 100 + 160 = 260 \text{ beds}
   \]

5. To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total occupied and out of service beds from the total capacity:
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied beds} = 800 - 260 = 540 \text{ beds}
   \]

6. Now, we need to account for the 35 patients admitted each day for 2 weeks (14 days):
   \[
   \text{Total patients admitted} = 35 \times 14 = 490 \text{ patients}
   \]

7. Finally, we subtract the total patients admitted from the unoccupied beds to find the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:

On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday and 28 boxes of orange pie. On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the cupcake cost ₺10 and the orange pie cost ₺22, how much was Andre's average daily earning?",980.0,"To find Andre's average daily earning, we first need to determine how many boxes of cupcakes and orange pies he sold each day.

### Step 1: Determine the sales for Monday
- **Cupcakes sold on Monday**: 24 boxes
- **Orange pies sold on Monday**: Since he sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pies than on Tuesday, we need to find out how many he sold on Tuesday first.

### Step 2: Determine the sales for Tuesday
- **Cupcakes sold on Tuesday**: He sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday.
  \[
  \text{Cupcakes on Tuesday} = 24 + 11 = 35 \text{ boxes}
  \]
- **Orange pies sold on Tuesday**: He sold 28 boxes of orange pies.

### Step 3: Calculate the orange pies sold on Monday
Since he sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pies on Monday than on Tuesday:
\[
\text{Orange pies on Monday} = 28 - 16 = 12 \text{ boxes}
\]

### Step 4: Determine the sales for Wednesday
On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. We need to calculate the total sales from Monday and Tuesday.

- **Total sales on Monday**:
  \[
  \text{Total on Monday} = \text{Cupcakes} + \text{Orange pies} = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ boxes}
  \]
- **Total sales on Tuesday**:
  \[
  \text{Total on Tuesday} = \text{Cupcakes} + \text{Orange pies} = 35 + 28 = 63 \text{ boxes}
  \]
- **Total sales for Monday and Tuesday combined**:
  \[
  \text{Total for Monday and Tuesday} = 36 + 63 = 99 \text{ boxes}
  \]
- **Sales on Wednesday**: He sold 99 boxes.

### Step 5: Calculate the earnings for each day
Now we calculate the earnings for each day based on the prices of cupcakes and orange pies.

- **Price of cupcakes**: ₺10
- **Price of orange pies**: ₺22

#### Earnings on Monday
- Earnings from cupcakes:
  \[
  \text{Earnings from cupcakes} = 24 \times 10 = ₺240
  \]
- Earnings from orange pies:
  \[
  \text{Earnings from orange pies} = 12 \times 22 = ₺264
  \]
- Total earnings on Monday:
  \[
  \text{Total on Monday} = 240 + 264 = ₺504
  \]

#### Earnings on Tuesday
- Earnings from cupcakes:
  \[
  \text{Earnings from cupcakes} = 35 \times 10 = ₺350
  \]
- Earnings from orange pies:
  \[
  \text{Earnings from orange pies} = 28 \times 22 = ₺616
  \]
- Total earnings on Tuesday:
  \[
  \text{Total on Tuesday} = 350 + 616 = ₺966
  \]

#### Earnings on Wednesday
- Since he sold 99 boxes, we need to determine how many of each type he sold. However, we can calculate the total earnings directly:
- Let \( x \) be the number of cupcakes sold on Wednesday and \( y \) be the number of orange pies sold on Wednesday. We know:
  \[
  x + y = 99
  \]
  But we don't have the exact breakdown. However, we can calculate the total earnings based on the average price of the items sold.

Assuming he sold the same ratio of cupcakes to orange pies as in the previous days, we can estimate the average price per box sold.

### Step 6: Calculate average price per box
- Total boxes sold over three days:
  \[
  \text{Total boxes} = 24 + 12 + 35 + 28 + 99 = 198
  \]
- Total earnings over three days:
  \[
  \text{Total earnings} = 504 + 966 + (99 \times \text{average price})
  \]
To find the average price, we can calculate the total earnings from Monday and Tuesday and then estimate Wednesday's earnings based on the average price of the items sold.

### Step 7: Calculate average daily earnings
- Total earnings from Monday and Tuesday:
  \[
  \text{Total earnings} = 504 + 966 = ₺1470
  \]
- Average price per box sold:
  \[
  \text{Average price} = \frac{(240 + 264 + 350 + 616)}{(24 + 12 + 35 + 28)} = \frac{1470}{99} \approx ₺14.85
  \]
- Earnings on Wednesday:
  \[
  \text{Earnings on Wednesday} = 99 \times 14.85 \approx ₺1460.15
  \]
- Total earnings over three days:
  \[
  \text{Total earnings} = 1470 + 1460.15 \approx ₺2930.15
  \]
- Average daily earnings:
  \[
  \text{Average daily earnings} = \frac{2930.15}{3} \approx ₺976.72

     - Total boxes sold on Monday:
       - Cupcakes: 24
       - Orange pies: (since he sold 16 fewer than Tuesday, we need to find Tuesday's orange pies first)
       - On Tuesday, he sold 28 orange pies, so on Monday he sold:
         \[
         28 - 16 = 12
         \]
       - Total boxes sold on Monday = 24 (cupcakes) + 12 (orange pies) = 36.
     - Total boxes sold on Tuesday:
       - Cupcakes: 35
       - Orange pies: 28
       - Total boxes sold on Tuesday = 35 + 28 = 63.
     - Total boxes sold in the past two days combined:
       \[
       36 + 63 = 99

         \[
         28 \times 22 = 616
         \]
       - Total earnings on Tuesday:
         \[
         350 + 616 = 966
         \]
     - **Wednesday:**
       - Earnings from cupcakes: 
         \[
         99 \times 10 = 990
         \]
       - Earnings from orange pies: 
         \[
         0 \text{ (since he sold only cupcakes on Wednesday)}

How long will it take her to peel and saute 60 clams if it takes 19 minutes to wash all the clams? Note that Yara can't work in parallel.,53.0,"To determine how long it will take Yara to peel and sauté 60 clams, we need to break down the tasks and calculate the time for each step.

1. **Washing the clams**: 
   - It takes Yara 19 minutes to wash all the clams.

2. **Peeling the clams**: 
   - Yara can peel 6 clams per minute.
   - For 60 clams, the time required to peel them is:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel} = \frac{60 \text{ clams}}{6 \text{ clams/min}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Sautéing the clams**: 
   - Yara can sauté 20 clams in 8 minutes.
   - To find out how long it takes to sauté 60 clams, we first determine how many batches of 20 clams are in 60 clams:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{60 \text{ clams}}{20 \text{ clams/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 8 minutes, the total time to sauté 60 clams is:
     \[
     \text{Time to sauté} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 8 \text{ minutes/batch} = 24 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Total time**: 
   - Now, we add the time for washing, peeling, and sautéing:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time to wash} + \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to sauté}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 19 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} + 24 \text{ minutes} = 53 \text{ minutes}

Thus, the total time it will take Yara to wash, peel, and sauté 60 clams is **53 minutes**.",53.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Washing the clams**: Yara takes 19 minutes to wash all the clams.

2. **Peeling the clams**: Yara can peel 6 clams a minute. To find out how long it takes her to peel 60 clams, we calculate:
   - Time to peel 60 clams = 60 clams / 6 clams per minute = 10 minutes.

3. **Sauteing the clams**: Yara can saute 20 clams in 8 minutes. To find out how long it takes her to saute 60 clams, we first determine how many batches of 20 clams are in 60 clams:
   - Number of batches = 60 clams / 20 clams per batch = 3 batches.
   - Time to saute 3 batches = 3 batches * 8 minutes per batch = 24 minutes.

4. **Total time**: Now, we add the time for washing, peeling, and sauteing:
   - Total time = Time to wash + Time to peel + Time to saute

Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet. How much older is Liam's uncle than Liam?,22.0,"Let's denote the following variables:

- Let \( U \) be the age of Liam's uncle when he first saw Comet Halley.
- Let \( L \) be Liam's age when he first saw Comet Halley.
- Let \( t \) be the number of years that have passed since Liam's uncle first saw the comet.

From the problem, we know:

1. Liam's uncle saw the comet when he was 31 years old, so:
   \[
   U = 31
   \]

2. The comet orbits the Sun every 53 years, so after 53 years, Liam's uncle will see the comet again. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   t = 53
   \]

3. When Liam's uncle first saw the comet, Liam was \( L \) years old. After 53 years, Liam's age will be:
   \[
   L + 53
   \]

4. The problem states that Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was twice the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet. Since Liam's uncle was 31 when he first saw the comet, we have:
   \[
   \text{Liam's age when he saw the comet for the second time} = 2 \times U = 2 \times 31 = 62
   \]

5. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   L + 53 = 62
   \]

6. Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = 62 - 53 = 9
   \]

Now we know that Liam was 9 years old when he first saw the comet.

Next, we can find out how much older Liam's uncle is than Liam. Since Liam's uncle was 31 when he first saw the comet and Liam was 9, the age difference is:
\[
U - L = 31 - 9 = 22
\]

Thus, Liam's uncle is \( \boxed{22} \) years older than Liam.",22.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Liam's uncle saw Comet Halley when he was 31 years old.
2. The comet orbits the Sun every 53 years, so the next time Liam's uncle would see the comet is when he is 31 + 53 = 84 years old.
3. Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet. 
4. Since Liam's uncle was 31 years old when he first saw the comet, two times that age is 2 * 31 = 62 years.
5. Therefore, Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was 62 years old.
6. Now, we need to find out how much older Liam's uncle is than Liam. 
7. When Liam was 62 years old, his uncle was 84 years old (as calculated in step 2).

- 100 seats for the event's staff  

Now, let's calculate the total number of reserved seats:  
900 + 300 + 100 = 1300 reserved seats.  

Next, we subtract the reserved seats from the total capacity to find out how many seats are available for friends and family:  
9400 - 1300 = 8100 seats available.  

Now, we need to determine how many graduates there are. Since the problem does not specify the number of graduates, we will assume that the number of graduates is equal to the number of reserved seats for them, which is 900.  

Finally, we divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family:  
8100 / 900 = 9.

They agree to split it with Tara getting 190 yards more than Ananya, and Umar getting 30 yards more than Tara. How much is left over for Ananya?",150.0,"Let's denote the amount of fence Ananya gets as \( A \) yards. According to the problem, Tara gets 190 yards more than Ananya, so we can express Tara's amount as:

\[
T = A + 190
\]

Umar gets 30 yards more than Tara, so we can express Umar's amount as:

\[
U = T + 30 = (A + 190) + 30 = A + 220
\]

Now, we can set up an equation for the total amount of fence:

\[
A + T + U = 860
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( T \) and \( U \) into the equation gives us:

\[
A + (A + 190) + (A + 220) = 860
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
A + A + 190 + A + 220 = 860

This simplifies to:

\[
3A + 410 = 860
\]

Next, we will isolate \( A \) by subtracting 410 from both sides:

\[
3A = 860 - 410

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( A \):

\[
A = \frac{450}{3} = 150

3. Umar gets 30 yards more than Tara, so Umar's amount can be represented as \( (A + 190) + 30 = A + 220 \).
4. Now, we can express the total amount of fence in terms of \( A \):
   \[
   A + (A + 190) + (A + 220) = 860

   - Purple balls: 11 balls at ₣9 each.
   - Pink balls: 17 balls at ₣4 each.

2. Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of ball:
   - Total cost for blue balls = 9 * 12 = ₣108.
   - Total cost for purple balls = 11 * 9 = ₣99.
   - Total cost for pink balls = 17 * 4 = ₣68.

3. Next, we add these amounts to find the total revenue before the discount:
   - Total revenue = ₣108 + ₣99 + ₣68 = ₣275.

4. Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total revenue:
   - Discount amount = 20% of ₣275 = 0.20 * 275 = ₣55.

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Olivia walks 20 kilometers every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 kilometers of walking on the beach and 10 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?",75.0,"Let \( v \) be Olivia's original speed on the beach in kilometers per hour. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is \( 4v \).

Since Olivia's speed has decreased by half due to her injury, her new speed on the beach is \( \frac{v}{2} \) and her new speed on the sidewalk is \( \frac{4v}{2} = 2v \).

We know that Olivia spends 60 minutes (or 1 hour) walking on the beach. The distance she walks on the beach is 10 kilometers. We can use the formula for time, which is:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

For the beach, we have:

\[
1 \text{ hour} = \frac{10 \text{ km}}{\frac{v}{2}}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
1 = \frac{10 \cdot 2}{v}
\]

\[
1 = \frac{20}{v}
\]

From this, we can solve for \( v \):

\[
v = 20 \text{ km/h}
\]

Now, we can find Olivia's new speed on the beach and sidewalk:

- New speed on the beach: \( \frac{v}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ km/h} \)
- New speed on the sidewalk: \( 2v = 2 \cdot 20 = 40 \text{ km/h} \)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Olivia to walk the 10 kilometers on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{10 \text{ km}}{40 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we can find the total time for the entire 20-kilometer walk:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 60 \text{ minutes} + 15 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it takes for Olivia to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk is:

\[
\boxed{75} \text{ minutes}
\]",75.0,1,"A: Let's think step by step.

1. Olivia walks a total of 20 kilometers every day, which includes 10 kilometers on the beach and 10 kilometers on the sidewalk.

2. We know that on the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the speed she does on the beach. Let's denote her original speed on the beach as \( v \). Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is \( 4v \).

3. Due to her recent injury, her speed has decreased by half. So, her new speed on the beach is \( \frac{v}{2} \) and her new speed on the sidewalk is \( \frac{4v}{2} = 2v \).

4. We are told that Olivia spends 60 minutes walking on the beach. To find out how far she walks on the beach, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Since she walks for 60 minutes (1 hour) on the beach at a speed of \( \frac{v}{2} \):
   \[
   \text{Distance on the beach} = \frac{v}{2} \times 1 = \frac{v}{2} \text{ kilometers}
   \]

5. We know that the distance on the beach is 10 kilometers, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{v}{2} = 10
   \]
   Solving for \( v \):
   \[
   v = 20 \text{ kilometers per hour}
   \]

6. Now, we can find her speed on the sidewalk:
   \[
   \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2v = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ kilometers per hour}
   \]

7. Next, we need to calculate how long it takes her to walk the 10 kilometers on the sidewalk. Using the same distance formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10}{40} = 0.25 \text{ hours}
   \]

8. Converting 0.25 hours to minutes:
   \[
   0.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 15 \text{ minutes}
   \]

9. Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the entire 20-kilometer walk:

After 34 minutes from the start of the call, the price drops even more to ¥0.1 per two minutes. How much would a 94-minute call cost?",22.0,"To calculate the total cost of a 94-minute call with the given pricing structure, we can break the call into three segments based on the pricing tiers:

1. **First 10 minutes**: 
   - Cost per minute: ¥0.7
   - Total cost for the first 10 minutes: 
     \[
     10 \text{ minutes} \times ¥0.7/\text{minute} = ¥7.0
     \]

2. **Next 24 minutes (from minute 11 to minute 34)**:
   - Cost per minute: ¥0.5
   - Total cost for the next 24 minutes: 
     \[
     24 \text{ minutes} \times ¥0.5/\text{minute} = ¥12.0
     \]

3. **Remaining 60 minutes (from minute 35 to minute 94)**:
   - Cost per two minutes: ¥0.1
   - Since the cost is given per two minutes, we first find out how many two-minute segments are in 60 minutes:
     \[
     \text{Number of two-minute segments} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 30

However, due to a recent injury, the maintenance worker has become slower and it will take them twice as long to clean a floor these days. If they work for 6 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?",60.0,"To determine the percentage of the day the maintenance worker spends cleaning floors, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the time taken to clean one floor after the injury:**
   - Originally, it took 6 minutes per floor.
   - Due to the injury, it now takes twice as long: 
     \[
     6 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 12 \text{ minutes per floor}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time required to clean all 180 floors:**
   - Total time in minutes:
     \[
     180 \text{ floors} \times 12 \text{ minutes per floor} = 2160 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Convert the total cleaning time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
     \[
     \frac{2160 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 36 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the total working hours over 10 days:**
   - The worker works 6 hours a day for 10 days:
     \[
     6 \text{ hours/day} \times 10 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ hours}

     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{36 \text{ hours}}{60 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 60\%

3. To find the total time needed to clean all 180 floors, we multiply the number of floors by the time per floor:
   \[
   180 \text{ floors} \times 12 \text{ minutes per floor} = 2160 \text{ minutes}
