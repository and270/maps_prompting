gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Sophia went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, and 60 mini cheesecakes. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,"To find the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen, we can start by calculating the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes that Sophia bought.

1. **Calculate the cost of the donuts:**
   - Sophia bought 60 donuts.
   - Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, she bought \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen of donuts is $19.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the donuts is:
     \[
     5 \text{ dozen} \times 19 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 95 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:**
   - Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes.
   - Since there are 12 mini cupcakes in a dozen, she bought \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen of mini cupcakes is $33.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the mini cupcakes is:
     \[
     5 \text{ dozen} \times 33 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 165 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost before discount:**
   - Let \( x \) be the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen.
   - Sophia bought 60 mini cheesecakes, which is also \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozen.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the mini cheesecakes is:
     \[
     5 \text{ dozen} \times x \text{ dollars/dozen} = 5x \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The total cost before the discount is:
     \[
     95 + 165 + 5x = 260 + 5x \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost after the 20% discount:**
   - The total amount paid after a 20% discount is $1500.
   - The equation for the total cost after the discount is:
     \[
     (260 + 5x) \times (1 - 0.20) = 1500
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     (260 + 5x) \times 0.80 = 1500
     \]
   - Dividing both sides by 0.80:
     \[
     260 + 5x = \frac{1500}{0.80} = 1875
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 260 from both sides:
     \[
     5x = 1875 - 260 = 1615
     \]
   - Divide by 5:
     \[
     x = \frac{1615}{5} = 323
     \]

Thus, the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is **$323**.",323.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the donuts:**
   - Sophia bought 60 donuts.
   - Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, she bought \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $19.
   - So, the total cost for the donuts is \( 5 \times 19 = 95 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:**
   - Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes.
   - Similarly, she bought \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $33.
   - So, the total cost for the mini cupcakes is \( 5 \times 33 = 165 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   - The total cost before the discount is the sum of the costs of the donuts and mini cupcakes plus the cost of the mini cheesecakes.
   - Let \( x \) be the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen.
   - The total cost before the discount is \( 95 + 165 + x \).

4. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**
   - Sophia received a 20% discount on her total purchase.
   - The total amount she paid after the discount is $1500.
   - This means the total cost before the discount is \( \frac{1500}{1 - 0.20} = \frac{1500}{0.80} = 1875 \) dollars.

5. **Set up the equation:**
   - We have the equation: 
   \[
   95 + 165 + x = 1875
   \]
   - Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   260 + x = 1875
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 260 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 1875 - 260 = 1615
   \]

7. **Calculate the cost per dozen of mini cheesecakes:**
   - Since \( x \) is the total cost for the mini cheesecakes, and she bought 60 mini cheesecakes (which is 5 dozen), the cost per dozen is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per dozen} = \frac{1615}{5} = 323
   \]

The answer is $323 per dozen for the mini cheesecakes.",323.0,1,,323.0,1

   \]

Thus, Hiroshi needs to consume **350 more grams of popcorn** than Tara.",350.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate Hiroshi's daily calorie target:**
   - Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs.
   - The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight.
   - So, Hiroshi's daily calorie target is 220 lbs * 15 calories/lb = 3300 calories.

2. **Calculate Hiroshi's net calorie intake:**
   - Hiroshi has already consumed 1100 calories.
   - He has burned 200 calories through exercise.
   - So, his net calorie intake is 1100 - 200 = 900 calories.

3. **Calculate how many more calories Hiroshi can consume:**
   - Hiroshi's remaining calories to reach his target is 3300 - 900 = 2400 calories.

4. **Calculate the calories in one serving of popcorn:**
   - A bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving.
   - The bag has 6 servings, so the total calories in the bag is 200 * 6 = 1200 calories.

5. **Calculate how many servings of popcorn Hiroshi can consume:**
   - To find out how many servings Hiroshi needs to consume to reach 2400 calories, we divide:
   - 2400 calories / 200 calories per serving = 12 servings.

6. **Calculate the total grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs:**
   - Since the bag has 6 servings and weighs 300 grams, the weight of one serving is:
   - 300 grams / 6 servings = 50 grams per serving.
   - Therefore, for 12 servings, Hiroshi needs:
   - 12 servings * 50 grams/serving = 600 grams of popcorn.

7. **Calculate Tara's daily calorie target:**
   - Tara weighs 140 lbs.
   - So, her daily calorie target is 140 lbs * 15 calories/lb = 2100 calories.

8. **Calculate Tara's net calorie intake:**
   - Tara has already consumed 900 calories from food and 200 calories from ice cream.
   - So, her total consumption is 900 + 200 = 1100 calories.

9. **Calculate how many more calories Tara can consume:**
   - Tara's remaining calories to reach her target is 2100 - 1100 = 1000 calories.

10. **Calculate how many servings of popcorn Tara can consume:**
    - To find out how many servings Tara needs to consume to reach 1000 calories, we divide:
    - 1000 calories / 200 calories per serving = 5 servings.

11. **Calculate the total grams of popcorn Tara needs:**

She already has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges of her large country home. She also purchased 200 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Daphne remain with?",335.0,"To find out how many potted plants Daphne will have remaining, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of potted plants Daphne currently has:**
   - She received 23 new potted plants two days ago.
   - She already has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges.

   First, calculate the total number of potted plants on the window ledges:
   \[
   \text{Total plants on ledges} = 8 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 56 \text{ ledges} = 448 \text{ plants}
   \]

   Now, add the new plants she received:
   \[
   \text{Total plants after receiving new ones} = 448 \text{ plants} + 23 \text{ plants} = 471 \text{ plants}
   \]

2. **Add the new plants she purchased yesterday:**
   - She purchased 200 new plants at a 50% discount, but the discount does not affect the total number of plants she has.
   \[
   \text{Total plants after purchase} = 471 \text{ plants} + 200 \text{ plants} = 671 \text{ plants}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of plants she will give away:**
   - She plans to give away 6 potted plants from each of the 56 ledges.
   \[
   \text{Total plants given away} = 6 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 56 \text{ ledges} = 336 \text{ plants}

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 60 minutes to cover every 4 miles of the city. However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city, we first need to understand the rate at which the fog is moving.

1. **Calculate the total distance across the city**: The city is 80 miles across.

2. **Determine the distance that represents 1/4 of the city**: 
   \[
   \text{Distance for } \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the city} = \frac{1}{4} \times 80 \text{ miles} = 20 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the fog's initial speed**: The fog covers 4 miles in 60 minutes. Therefore, the speed of the fog is:
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{15} \text{ miles per minute}
   \]

4. **Calculate the time to cover 20 miles at the initial speed**:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \text{Distance} \div \text{Speed} = 20 \text{ miles} \div \left(\frac{1}{15} \text{ miles per minute}\right) = 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Consider the effect of the wind speed halving**: The problem states that the wind speed will be halved in one hour. Since the fog is moving at a speed of \(\frac{1}{15}\) miles per minute, halving this speed gives:
   \[
   \text{New speed} = \frac{1}{15} \div 2 = \frac{1}{30} \text{ miles per minute}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time to cover 20 miles at the new speed**:
   \[
   \text{Time} = 20 \text{ miles} \div \left(\frac{1}{30} \text{ miles per minute}\right) = 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ minutes}
   \]

7. **Determine the total time to cover 20 miles**: The fog will take 300 minutes to cover the first 20 miles at the initial speed. After one hour (60 minutes), the speed will halve, and it will take an additional 600 minutes to cover the remaining distance.

However, since we are only interested in the time to cover the first 20 miles, we can conclude that:

The fog will take **300 minutes** to cover 1/4 of the city before the wind speed changes.

4. The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes.
5. To find out how long it takes to cover 1 mile, we can divide the time by the distance: 60 minutes / 4 miles = 15 minutes per mile.
6. Now, we need to calculate the time to cover 20 miles: 20 miles * 15 minutes per mile = 300 minutes.

The answer is 300 minutes.",300.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes.
2. The total distance of the city from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge is 80 miles.
3. We need to find out how long it takes for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city.
4. 1/4 of the city is 80 miles / 4 = 20 miles.
5. Since the fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, we can find out how long it takes to cover 20 miles.
6. To find the time to cover 20 miles, we can set up a proportion:
   - If 4 miles takes 60 minutes, then 20 miles will take (20 miles / 4 miles) * 60 minutes = 5 * 60 minutes = 300 minutes.
7. However, we need to consider that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. This means that the fog bank will cover less distance in the same amount of time after one hour.
8. The fog bank will cover 4 miles in the first hour (60 minutes), but after that, it will cover only 2 miles in the next hour (60 minutes) due to the halved wind speed.
9. In the first hour, it covers 4 miles, leaving 20 miles - 4 miles = 16 miles to cover.
10. In the second hour, it covers 2 miles, leaving 16 miles - 2 miles = 14 miles to cover.
11. Continuing this process, we find that it will take additional time to cover the remaining distance at the reduced speed.

To summarize:
- In the first hour, it covers 4 miles (60 minutes).
- In the second hour, it covers 2 miles (60 minutes).
- The remaining distance is 14 miles.
- At the halved speed, it will take 14 miles / 2 miles per hour = 7 hours to cover the remaining distance.

Calculating the total time:
- 1 hour (60 minutes) + 1 hour (60 minutes) + 7 hours (420 minutes) = 60 + 60 + 420 = 540 minutes.

On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 2-hour episodes. On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?",6.0,"To find out how many 15-minute episodes Santiago watched on Thursday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he spent watching TV from Tuesday to Sunday, excluding Thursday.

1. **Tuesday**: Watched 4 hours.
2. **Wednesday**: Watched 4 hours.
3. **Thursday**: Watched \( x \) episodes of 15 minutes each (we will calculate this later).
4. **Friday**: Watched 3 hours and 45 minutes.
   - Convert 45 minutes to hours: \( 45 \text{ minutes} = \frac{45}{60} = 0.75 \text{ hours} \).
   - Total for Friday: \( 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 \text{ hours} \).
5. **Saturday**: Watched three 2-hour episodes.
   - Total for Saturday: \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \).
6. **Sunday**: Watched three 15-minute episodes.
   - Convert 15 minutes to hours: \( 15 \text{ minutes} = \frac{15}{60} = 0.25 \text{ hours} \).
   - Total for Sunday: \( 3 \times 0.25 = 0.75 \text{ hours} \).

Now, let's sum the hours watched from Tuesday to Sunday, excluding Thursday:

\[
\text{Total hours from Tuesday to Sunday} = 4 + 4 + 3.75 + 6 + 0.75
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

\[
4 + 4 = 8
\]
\[
8 + 3.75 = 11.75
\]
\[
11.75 + 6 = 17.75
\]
\[
17.75 + 0.75 = 18.5
\]

So, the total time watched from Tuesday to Sunday, excluding Thursday, is \( 18.5 \) hours.

Now, we know that Santiago watched a total of 20 hours of TV. Therefore, the time he spent watching TV on Thursday is:

\[
\text{Time on Thursday} = 20 - 18.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we need to convert this time into 15-minute episodes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.5 hours is:

\[
1.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \times 60 = 90 \text{ minutes}

   - On Thursday, he watched some 15-minute episodes (we'll calculate this later).
   - On Friday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. 
     - 3 hours = 3 hours
     - 45 minutes = 0.75 hours
     - Total for Friday = 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.
   - On Saturday, he watched three 2-hour episodes.
     - 2 hours * 3 = 6 hours.

2. **Add the hours from Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday:**
   - Total hours from Tuesday and Wednesday = 4 + 4 = 8 hours.
   - Total hours from Friday = 3.75 hours.
   - Total hours from Saturday = 6 hours.
   - So, total hours from Tuesday to Saturday = 8 + 3.75 + 6 = 17.75 hours.

3. **Calculate the total hours watched on Sunday:**
   - On Sunday, he watched three 15-minute episodes.
   - 15 minutes = 0.25 hours.

She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, and uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the ratios and the total amounts used by Nia.

1. **Understanding the Ratios**:
   - The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is given as 54:27. This can be simplified:
     \[
     \frac{54}{27} = 2
     \]
   - This means for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, there are 1 cup of water.

2. **Milk and Cream Ratios**:
   - Nia uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, which simplifies to 1 tablespoon of milk per cup of water.
   - She uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar.

3. **Setting Up the Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of teaspoons of sugar used.
   - From the sugar to water ratio, the number of cups of water used will be \( \frac{x}{2} \).
   - The number of tablespoons of milk used will also be \( \frac{x}{2} \) (since she uses 1 tablespoon of milk per cup of water).
   - The number of tablespoons of heavy cream used will be \( 2x \) (since she uses 2 tablespoons of cream for every teaspoon of sugar).

4. **Total Amount Used**:
   - The total amount of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is given as 240. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x + \frac{x}{2} = 240
   \]

5. **Combining Like Terms**:
   - Combine the terms:
   \[
   x + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = 240
   \]
   - This simplifies to:
   \[
   x + 2x + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 240
   \]
   - Which further simplifies to:
   \[
   x + 2x + x = 240
   \]
   - Thus:
   \[
   4x = 240
   \]

6. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = \frac{240}{4} = 60
   \]

Therefore, the number of teaspoons of sugar Nia used is \( \boxed{60} \).",60.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. We know that Nia uses sugar and water in a ratio of 54:27. This means for every 54 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 27 cups of water.

2. We can simplify this ratio. Dividing both parts by 27 gives us:
   - Sugar: 54 / 27 = 2
   - Water: 27 / 27 = 1
   So, the simplified ratio is 2:1. This means for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 1 cup of water.

3. Nia also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water. This means she uses 1 tablespoon of milk for every cup of water.

4. Additionally, she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar.

5. Now, we need to find out how many total parts are involved in her recipe. Let's denote:
   - Sugar = 2 parts
   - Water = 1 part
   - Milk = 1 part (for every cup of water)
   - Cream = 2 parts (for every teaspoon of sugar)

6. Therefore, for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, she uses:
   - 1 cup of water
   - 1 tablespoon of milk
   - 2 tablespoons of cream

7. The total parts for every 2 teaspoons of sugar is:
   - 2 (sugar) + 1 (water) + 1 (milk) + 2 (cream) = 6 parts.

8. Now, we know that the total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is 240.

9. Since each set of 6 parts corresponds to 2 teaspoons of sugar, we can find out how many sets of 6 parts fit into 240:
   - Total parts = 240 / 6 = 40 sets.

10. Each set corresponds to 2 teaspoons of sugar, so the total teaspoons of sugar used is:
    - 40 sets * 2 teaspoons of sugar per set = 80 teaspoons of sugar.

The answer is 80.",80.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

3. Nia also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, which simplifies to 1 tablespoon of milk per cup of water.
4. Additionally, she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar.
5. Now, we need to find out how many total parts are involved in the mixture. The total parts consist of:
   - 2 parts sugar
   - 1 part water
   - 1 part milk (since she uses 1 tablespoon of milk for each cup of water)
   - 2 parts cream (since she uses 2 tablespoons of cream for each teaspoon of sugar)

6. Adding these parts together gives us:
   - 2 (sugar) + 1 (water) + 1 (milk) + 2 (cream) = 6 parts total.

7. Nia used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. Since we have 6 parts, we can find the value of each part by dividing the total by the number of parts:
   - 240 total units / 6 parts = 40 units per part.

8. Now, we can find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used:
   - Since sugar is 2 parts, we multiply the units per part by the number of parts for sugar: 
   - 2 parts * 40 units/part = 80 teaspoons of sugar.

In addition, Ravi owns a 13-square yard apricot field that produces 12 apricots per square yard. The apricots can be harvested every 4 months. In the span of two years, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?",1764.0,"To find out how many more bananas Ravi harvests than apricots in two years, we will first calculate the total harvest of bananas and apricots separately, and then compare the two.

### Step 1: Calculate the total bananas harvested

1. **Banana field area**: 10 square yards
2. **Bananas per four-fifths of a square yard**: 36 bananas

First, we need to find out how many bananas are produced per square yard:

\[
\text{Bananas per square yard} = \frac{36 \text{ bananas}}{\frac{4}{5} \text{ square yards}} = 36 \times \frac{5}{4} = 45 \text{ bananas per square yard}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total number of bananas produced in the 10 square yards:

\[
\text{Total bananas} = 10 \text{ square yards} \times 45 \text{ bananas per square yard} = 450 \text{ bananas}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many times Ravi can harvest in two years. Since he can harvest every 4 months, in two years (which is 24 months), he can harvest:

\[
\text{Number of harvests} = \frac{24 \text{ months}}{4 \text{ months per harvest}} = 6 \text{ harvests}
\]

Thus, the total number of bananas harvested in two years is:

\[
\text{Total bananas in 2 years} = 450 \text{ bananas} \times 6 = 2700 \text{ bananas}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total apricots harvested

1. **Apricot field area**: 13 square yards
2. **Apricots per square yard**: 12 apricots

Now, we can calculate the total number of apricots produced in the 13 square yards:

\[
\text{Total apricots} = 13 \text{ square yards} \times 12 \text{ apricots per square yard} = 156 \text{ apricots}
\]

Using the same number of harvests (6) as for the bananas, the total number of apricots harvested in two years is:

\[
\text{Total apricots in 2 years} = 156 \text{ apricots} \times 6 = 936 \text{ apricots}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference between bananas and apricots harvested

Now, we can find out how many more bananas Ravi harvests than apricots:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total bananas} - \text{Total apricots} = 2700 \text{ bananas} - 936 \text{ apricots} = 1764
\]

### Conclusion

Ravi harvests **1764 more bananas** than apricots in the span of two years.",1764.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total area of the banana field:**
   Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field.

2. **Determine the number of bananas produced per square yard:**
   There are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard. To find the number of bananas per square yard, we can set up a proportion:
   \[
   \text{Bananas per square yard} = \frac{36 \text{ bananas}}{\frac{4}{5} \text{ square yards}} = 36 \times \frac{5}{4} = 45 \text{ bananas per square yard}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of bananas harvested:**
   The total number of bananas in the 10 square yards is:
   \[
   10 \text{ square yards} \times 45 \text{ bananas per square yard} = 450 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. **Determine the harvest frequency for bananas:**
   Ravi can harvest his bananas every 4 months. In 2 years (which is 24 months), he can harvest:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ months}}{4 \text{ months per harvest}} = 6 \text{ harvests}
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of bananas harvested in 2 years is:
   \[
   450 \text{ bananas} \times 6 = 2700 \text{ bananas}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total area of the apricot field:**
   Ravi owns a 13-square yard apricot field.

6. **Determine the number of apricots produced per square yard:**
   The apricot field produces 12 apricots per square yard.

7. **Calculate the total number of apricots harvested:**
   The total number of apricots in the 13 square yards is:
   \[
   13 \text{ square yards} \times 12 \text{ apricots per square yard} = 156 \text{ apricots}
   \]

8. **Determine the harvest frequency for apricots:**
   Ravi can harvest his apricots every 4 months. In 2 years (24 months), he can harvest:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ months}}{4 \text{ months per harvest}} = 6 \text{ harvests}
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of apricots harvested in 2 years is:
   \[
   156 \text{ apricots} \times 6 = 936 \text{ apricots}

9. **Calculate the difference in the number of bananas and apricots harvested:**
   The difference is:
   \[
   2700 \text{ bananas} - 936 \text{ apricots} = 1764

   12 \text{ folders} \times 4.75 \text{ dollars/folder} = 57.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of erasers**:
   \[
   8 \text{ erasers} \times 14.50 \text{ dollars/eraser} = 116.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of bond paper**:
   \[
   1 \text{ ream} \times 11.00 \text{ dollars/ream} = 11.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of pencils**:
   \[
   7 \text{ pencils} \times 8.00 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 56.00 \text{ dollars}

5. **Total cost without membership**:
   \[
   57.00 + 116.00 + 11.00 + 56.00 = 240.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost with membership

1. **Cost of folders**:
   \[
   12 \text{ folders} \times 4.75 \text{ dollars/folder} = 57.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of erasers**:
   \[
   8 \text{ erasers} \times 14.50 \text{ dollars/eraser} = 116.00 \text{ dollars}

5. **Total cost before discount with membership**:
   \[
   57.00 + 116.00 + 11.00 + 56.00 = 240.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Apply the 20% discount**:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 240.00 = 0.20 \times 240.00 = 48.00 \text{ dollars}

7. **Add the membership fee**:
   \[
   192.00 + 20.00 = 212.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 3: Compare the total costs

- Total cost without membership: **$240.00**
- Total cost with membership: **$212.00**

### Conclusion

The least amount Arjun can spend on everything is **$212.00**.",212.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost without any discounts:**
   - Cost of folders: 12 folders * $4.75 each = 12 * 4.75 = $57.00
   - Cost of erasers: 8 erasers * $14.50 each = 8 * 14.50 = $116.00
   - Cost of bond paper: 1 ream * $11.00 = $11.00
   - Cost of pencils: 7 pencils * $8.00 each = 7 * 8 = $56.00

   Now, let's add these costs together:
   - Total cost = $57.00 + $116.00 + $11.00 + $56.00 = $240.00

2. **Calculate the total cost with membership and a 20% discount:**
   - Membership fee = $20.00
   - Discount on total cost = 20% of $240.00 = 0.20 * 240 = $48.00
   - Total cost with membership = Total cost - Discount + Membership fee
   - Total cost with membership = $240.00 - $48.00 + $20.00 = $212.00

3. **Calculate the total cost without membership and a 5% discount:**
   - Discount on total cost = 5% of $240.00 = 0.05 * 240 = $12.00
   - Total cost without membership = Total cost - Discount
   - Total cost without membership = $240.00 - $12.00 = $228.00

4. **Compare the two total costs:**
   - Total cost with membership = $212.00
   - Total cost without membership = $228.00

The least amount Arjun can spend on everything is the lower of the two totals.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row, than that he rolls four even numbers in a row?",50.0,"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events: rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row and rolling four even numbers in a row with a twenty-sided die.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5.

A twenty-sided die has the numbers 1 through 20. The numbers greater than 5 are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. 

Counting these, we find:
- Numbers greater than 5: 15 (from 6 to 20)

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is:
\[
P(\text{greater than 5}) = \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is:
\[
P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) = P(\text{greater than 5}) \times P(\text{greater than 5}) = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) \times \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \frac{9}{16}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the probability of rolling an even number.

The even numbers on a twenty-sided die are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20. 

Counting these, we find:
- Even numbers: 10 (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20)

The probability of rolling an even number is:
\[
P(\text{even}) = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling an even number four times in a row is:
\[
P(\text{even four times}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16}
\]

### Step 5: Compare the two probabilities.

Now we have:
- Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row: \(\frac{9}{16}\)
- Probability of rolling four even numbers in a row: \(\frac{1}{16}\)

### Step 6: Calculate the difference in percentage points.

To find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 5 twice in a row compared to rolling four even numbers in a row, we calculate:
\[
\text{Difference} = P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) - P(\text{even four times}) = \frac{9}{16} - \frac{1}{16} = \frac{8}{16} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 7: Convert the difference to percentage points.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
\]

Thus, the difference in likelihood, expressed in percentage points, is:

   - There are 15 numbers greater than 5.
   - The total number of outcomes on a twenty-sided die is 20.
   - So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is \( \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \).

2. **Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row.**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is \( 0.75 \times 0.75 = 0.75^2 = 0.5625 \).

3. **Determine the probability of rolling an even number on a twenty-sided die.**
   - The even numbers on a twenty-sided die are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20.
   - There are 10 even numbers.
   - So, the probability of rolling an even number is \( \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

4. **Calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row.**
   - The probability of rolling an even number four times in a row is \( 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.5^4 = 0.0625 \).

5. **Find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row and rolling four even numbers in a row.**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is 0.5625.
   - The probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is 0.0625.
   - The difference in probability is \( 0.5625 - 0.0625 = 0.5 \).

6. **Convert the difference to percentage points.**
   - To express this difference in percentage points, we multiply by 100: \( 0.5 \times 100 = 50 \).

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?",11000.0,"To determine how much more the total cost will be than Mrs. Lee's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the townhouse after applying the discount and adding the brokerage and transfer fees.

1. **Calculate the discount on the selling price:**
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = 400,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 25\% \text{ of Selling Price} = 0.25 \times 400,000 = 100,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Discount} = 400,000 - 100,000 = 300,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee (5% of the selling price):**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 5\% \text{ of Selling Price} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the transfer fee (12% of the selling price):**
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 12\% \text{ of Selling Price} = 0.12 \times 400,000 = 48,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Discounted Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 300,000 + 20,000 + 48,000 = 368,000

5. **Determine how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Lee's budget:**
   \[
   \text{Budget} = 340,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount Over Budget} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Budget} = 368,000 - 340,000 = 28,000

Thus, the total cost will be **$28,000** more than Mrs. Lee's budget.",28000.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The selling price of the property is $400,000.
2. Mrs. Lee can get a 25% discount on the selling price.
   - The discount amount is 25% of $400,000, which is calculated as:
     \[
     0.25 \times 400,000 = 100,000
     \]
   - Therefore, the discounted price is:
     \[
     400,000 - 100,000 = 300,000

3. Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price:
   - The brokerage fee is:
     \[
     0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000

4. Now, we calculate the transfer fee, which is 12% of the selling price:
   - The transfer fee is:
     \[
     0.12 \times 400,000 = 48,000
     \]

5. Now, we can find the total cost of the property after applying the discount and adding the fees:
   - The total cost is:
     \[
     \text{Discounted Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee} = 300,000 + 20,000 + 48,000

   - The difference is:
     \[
     368,000 - 340,000 = 28,000

He paid the legal fees that amounted to 2% of the selling price and also paid a realtor fee that is 5% of the selling price. He also paid $440000 for the remaining loan amount on the villa, and $5000 for closing costs. Dr. Brown used the net proceeds from selling the villa to invest in stocks. The stocks gained 10% each year for two years. How much were Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years?",80465.0,"To find Dr. Brown's net proceeds after selling his villa and investing the money in stocks, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total selling costs (legal fees and realtor fees).**
2. **Determine the net proceeds from the sale of the villa.**
3. **Calculate the value of the investment in stocks after two years.**

### Step 1: Calculate Selling Costs

**Selling Price of the Villa:** $550,000

**Legal Fees:**  
Legal fees are 2% of the selling price.  
\[
\text{Legal Fees} = 0.02 \times 550,000 = 11,000
\]

**Realtor Fees:**  
Realtor fees are 5% of the selling price.  
\[
\text{Realtor Fees} = 0.05 \times 550,000 = 27,500
\]

**Total Selling Costs:**  
\[
\text{Total Selling Costs} = \text{Legal Fees} + \text{Realtor Fees} = 11,000 + 27,500 = 38,500
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Net Proceeds

**Amount Paid for Remaining Loan:** $440,000  
**Closing Costs:** $5,000  

**Total Costs:**  
\[
\text{Total Costs} = \text{Total Selling Costs} + \text{Remaining Loan} + \text{Closing Costs} = 38,500 + 440,000 + 5,000 = 483,500
\]

**Net Proceeds from Sale:**  
\[
\text{Net Proceeds} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Total Costs} = 550,000 - 483,500 = 66,500
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Value of Investment in Stocks After Two Years

Dr. Brown invests the net proceeds of $66,500 in stocks that gain 10% each year.

**Value After Year 1:**  
\[
\text{Value After Year 1} = \text{Initial Investment} \times (1 + \text{Rate}) = 66,500 \times (1 + 0.10) = 66,500 \times 1.10 = 73,150
\]

**Value After Year 2:**  
\[
\text{Value After Year 2} = \text{Value After Year 1} \times (1 + \text{Rate}) = 73,150 \times (1 + 0.10) = 73,150 \times 1.10 = 80,465
\]

### Final Result

Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years of investing in stocks is **$80,465**.",80465.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the legal fees:**
   - The selling price of the villa is $550,000.
   - The legal fees are 2% of the selling price.
   - Legal fees = 2% of $550,000 = 0.02 * 550,000 = $11,000.

2. **Calculate the realtor fee:**
   - The realtor fee is 5% of the selling price.
   - Realtor fee = 5% of $550,000 = 0.05 * 550,000 = $27,500.

3. **Calculate the total fees paid:**
   - Total fees = Legal fees + Realtor fee = $11,000 + $27,500 = $38,500.

4. **Calculate the net proceeds from the sale:**
   - Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees - Remaining loan amount - Closing costs.
   - Remaining loan amount = $440,000.
   - Closing costs = $5,000.
   - Net proceeds = $550,000 - $38,500 - $440,000 - $5,000 = $66,500.

5. **Calculate the investment growth over two years:**
   - The stocks gain 10% each year.
   - After the first year, the value of the investment = Net proceeds + (10% of Net proceeds).
   - Value after 1 year = $66,500 + (0.10 * $66,500) = $66,500 + $6,650 = $73,150.
   - After the second year, the value of the investment = Value after 1 year + (10% of Value after 1 year).
   - Value after 2 years = $73,150 + (0.10 * $73,150) = $73,150 + $7,315 = $80,465.

An eighth of the tennis balls are indigo, and all except an eighth of those indigo balls are marked. How many marked balls are there in total?",16.0,"To find the total number of marked balls, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of balls**: The juggler can juggle 160 balls.

2. **Golf balls**: 
   - \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the balls are golf balls.
   - Number of golf balls = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 160 = 32 \).

3. **Tennis balls**: 
   - The rest are tennis balls.
   - Number of tennis balls = Total balls - Golf balls = \( 160 - 32 = 128 \).

4. **Marked golf balls**:
   - \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the golf balls are yellow.
   - Number of yellow golf balls = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 32 = 16 \).
   - \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the yellow golf balls are marked.
   - Number of marked yellow golf balls = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 16 = 2 \).

5. **Marked tennis balls**:
   - \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the tennis balls are indigo.
   - Number of indigo tennis balls = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 128 = 16 \).
   - All except \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the indigo balls are marked.
   - Number of marked indigo tennis balls = Total indigo tennis balls - Unmarked indigo tennis balls.
   - Unmarked indigo tennis balls = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 16 = 2 \).
   - Therefore, marked indigo tennis balls = \( 16 - 2 = 14 \).

6. **Total marked balls**:

3. The rest of the balls are tennis balls. To find the number of tennis balls, we subtract the number of golf balls from the total:
   \[
   \text{Number of tennis balls} = 160 - 32 = 128

8. Therefore, the number of marked indigo balls is:
   \[
   \text{Number of marked indigo balls} = 16 - 2 = 14

If there are one-fourth the number of boys in the park, what percentage of the kids in the park are girls?",80.0,"To find the percentage of kids in the park that are girls, we first need to determine the number of boys in the park.

We know that there are 16 girls, and the number of boys is one-fourth the number of girls. Therefore, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Number of girls} = \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4

Now, we can find the total number of kids in the park by adding the number of girls and boys:

\[
\text{Total number of kids} = \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of boys} = 16 + 4 = 20

4. **Calculate the percentage of puppies with spots:**
   - The percentage of puppies with spots is given by:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total spotted puppies}}{\text{Total puppies}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values we found:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{792}{880} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Calculating this gives:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = 0.9 \times 100 = 90\%
     \]

Thus, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is \( \boxed{90} \).",90.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of puppies for each person:**
   - Jamal's dog has 131 puppies.
   - Gabriel's dog has 47 puppies.
   - Yuki has 54 dogs, each with 13 puppies, so the total for Yuki is 54 * 13 = 702 puppies.

2. **Calculate the total number of puppies:**
   - Total puppies = Jamal's puppies + Gabriel's puppies + Yuki's puppies
   - Total puppies = 131 + 47 + 702 = 880 puppies.

3. **Calculate the number of spotted puppies:**
   - Jamal has 23 spotted puppies.
   - Gabriel has 13 spotted puppies.
   - Yuki has 54 dogs, each with 13 spotted puppies, so the total for Yuki is 54 * 13 = 702 spotted puppies.
   - Total spotted puppies = Jamal's spotted + Gabriel's spotted + Yuki's spotted
   - Total spotted puppies = 23 + 13 + 702 = 738 spotted puppies.

4. **Calculate the number of unspotted puppies for Jamal:**
   - Jamal's unspotted puppies = Total puppies - Spotted puppies
   - Jamal's unspotted puppies = 131 - 23 = 108 unspotted puppies.

5. **Determine how many of Jamal's unspotted puppies actually have spots:**
   - Half of Jamal's unspotted puppies have spots: 108 / 2 = 54 puppies.

6. **Calculate the new total number of spotted puppies:**
   - New total spotted puppies = Original spotted puppies + Newly discovered spotted puppies
   - New total spotted puppies = 738 + 54 = 792 spotted puppies.

7. **Calculate the percentage of puppies that have spots:**
   - Percentage of spotted puppies = (Total spotted puppies / Total puppies) * 100

Since apples are a rare treat, he only buys four 3-kg boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys twelve 6-kg bags. Hay are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys thirty four 39-kg packs. Corn are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 17-kg sacks. Finally, he buys 43 kgs of groceries, and 27 kgs of tools, and 100 kgs of wood. A farm truck can carry 160 kgs at a time. If the farmer has three trucks, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the purchased items?",4.0,"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the purchased items, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the items he bought.

1. **Calculate the weight of apples:**
   - He buys 4 boxes of apples, each weighing 3 kg.

Later, Uma saw another 10-foot shark with 6 remoras, each 8 inches long, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?",45.0,"To find the average percentage of each shark's body length that is covered by the remoras, we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert the lengths of the remoras from inches to feet.**
2. **Calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each shark.**
3. **Determine the number of remoras remaining after some swam away.**
4. **Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that is covered by the remoras.**
5. **Find the average percentage for both sharks.**

### Step 1: Convert the lengths of the remoras to feet

- For the first shark:
  - Each remora is 16 inches long.
  - Convert inches to feet: \( \frac{16 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ feet} \).

- For the second shark:
  - Each remora is 8 inches long.
  - Convert inches to feet: \( \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \).

### Step 2: Calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each shark

- For the first shark (40-foot shark with 18 remoras):
  - Total length of remoras: \( 18 \times \frac{4}{3} = 24 \text{ feet} \).

- For the second shark (10-foot shark with 6 remoras):
  - Total length of remoras: \( 6 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \text{ feet} \).

### Step 3: Determine the number of remoras remaining after some swam away

- For the first shark:
  - \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the remoras swam away: 
  - Number of remoras that swam away: \( \frac{1}{6} \times 18 = 3 \).
  - Remaining remoras: \( 18 - 3 = 15 \).

- For the second shark:
  - No remoras swam away, so the number of remoras remains 6.

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that is covered by the remoras

- For the first shark:
  - Length of remaining remoras: \( 15 \times \frac{4}{3} = 20 \text{ feet} \).
  - Percentage of the shark's body length covered: 
  \[
  \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{40 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 50\%.
  \]

- For the second shark:
  - Length of remoras: \( 6 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \text{ feet} \).
  - Percentage of the shark's body length covered: 
  \[
  \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 40\%.
  \]

### Step 5: Find the average percentage for both sharks

- Average percentage:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{50\% + 40\%}{2} = \frac{90\%}{2} = 45\%.
\]

Thus, the average percentage of each shark's body length that is covered by the remoras is **45%**.",45.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the first shark:**
   - There are 18 remoras, each 16 inches long.
   - Total length of remoras = 18 * 16 = 288 inches.

2. **Convert the shark's length from feet to inches:**
   - The first shark is 40 feet long.
   - 1 foot = 12 inches, so 40 feet = 40 * 12 = 480 inches.

3. **Calculate the percentage of the first shark's body length covered by the remoras:**
   - Percentage = (Total length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100
   - Percentage for the first shark = (288 / 480) * 100 = 60%.

4. **Determine how many remoras swam away:**
   - 1/6 of the 18 remoras swam away.
   - Number of remoras that swam away = 18 / 6 = 3.
   - Remaining remoras = 18 - 3 = 15.

5. **Calculate the total length of the remaining remoras:**
   - Remaining remoras = 15, each 16 inches long.
   - Total length of remaining remoras = 15 * 16 = 240 inches.

6. **Calculate the percentage of the first shark's body length covered by the remaining remoras:**
   - Percentage for remaining remoras = (240 / 480) * 100 = 50%.

7. **Now, calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the second shark:**
   - There are 6 remoras, each 8 inches long.
   - Total length of remoras = 6 * 8 = 48 inches.

8. **Convert the second shark's length from feet to inches:**
   - The second shark is 10 feet long.
   - 10 feet = 10 * 12 = 120 inches.

9. **Calculate the percentage of the second shark's body length covered by the remoras:**
   - Percentage for the second shark = (48 / 120) * 100 = 40%.

10. **Calculate the average percentage of both sharks' body lengths covered by the remoras:**
    - Average percentage = (Percentage for first shark + Percentage for second shark) / 2
    - Average percentage = (60 + 40) / 2 = 50%.

The answer is 50%.",50.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the first shark.

1. Uma saw a 40-foot shark with 18 remoras, each 16 inches long.
   - Convert the length of the shark from feet to inches: 
     40 feet = 40 * 12 = 480 inches.
   - Calculate the total length of the remoras before any swam away:
     Total length of remoras = 18 remoras * 16 inches/remora = 288 inches.

2. Next, we find out how many remoras swam away.
   - 1/6 of the remoras swam away: 
     Number of remoras that swam away = 18 * (1/6) = 3 remoras.
   - Therefore, the number of remoras left = 18 - 3 = 15 remoras.
   - Calculate the total length of the remaining remoras:
     Total length of remaining remoras = 15 remoras * 16 inches/remora = 240 inches.

3. Now, we calculate the percentage of the first shark's body length that is covered by the remaining remoras:
   - Percentage covered = (Total length of remaining remoras / Length of shark) * 100
   - Percentage covered = (240 inches / 480 inches) * 100 = 50%.

Next, we analyze the second shark.

4. Uma saw another 10-foot shark with 6 remoras, each 8 inches long.
   - Convert the length of the second shark from feet to inches:
     10 feet = 10 * 12 = 120 inches.
   - Calculate the total length of the remoras:
     Total length of remoras = 6 remoras * 8 inches/remora = 48 inches.

5. Now, we calculate the percentage of the second shark's body length that is covered by the remoras:
   - Percentage covered = (Total length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100
   - Percentage covered = (48 inches / 120 inches) * 100 = 40%.

Finally, we find the average percentage of both sharks' body lengths covered by the remoras.

6. Average percentage = (Percentage covered by first shark + Percentage covered by second shark) / 2
   - Average percentage = (50% + 40%) / 2 = 45%.

Carlos has 720 almonds, 7 bowls and 3 tables. Unfortunately, 2 tables break. Carlos then eats one-fifth of all the almonds. How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?",14.0,"To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the capacity of the bowls and tables.**
   - Each bowl can hold 24 almonds.
   - Each table can hold three times the capacity of a bowl:
     \[
     \text{Capacity of each table} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ almonds}

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and tables before any tables break.**
   - Carlos has 7 bowls:
     \[
     \text{Total capacity of bowls} = 7 \times 24 = 168 \text{ almonds}

   - Carlos has 3 tables:
     \[
     \text{Total capacity of tables} = 3 \times 72 = 216 \text{ almonds}

   - Therefore, the total capacity of all bowls and tables combined is:
     \[
     \text{Total capacity} = 168 + 216 = 384 \text{ almonds}
     \]

3. **Account for the broken tables.**
   - After 2 tables break, Carlos has:
     \[
     \text{Remaining tables} = 3 - 2 = 1 \text{ table}
     \]
   - The capacity of the remaining table is:
     \[
     \text{Capacity of remaining table} = 1 \times 72 = 72 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - Now, the total capacity with the remaining bowls and tables is:
     \[
     \text{Total capacity with 1 table} = 168 + 72 = 240 \text{ almonds}
     \]

4. **Calculate how many almonds Carlos has after eating some.**
   - Carlos starts with 720 almonds and eats one-fifth of them:
     \[
     \text{Almonds eaten} = \frac{1}{5} \times 720 = 144 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - Therefore, the remaining almonds are:
     \[
     \text{Remaining almonds} = 720 - 144 = 576 \text{ almonds}
     \]

5. **Determine how many more bowls are needed to hold the remaining almonds.**
   - Carlos can currently hold 240 almonds with the remaining bowls and tables.
   - To find out how many more bowls are needed, we first calculate how many bowls are required to hold 576 almonds:
     \[
     \text{Bowls needed} = \frac{576}{24} = 24 \text{ bowls}
     \]
   - Since Carlos already has 7 bowls, the additional bowls needed are:
     \[
     \text{Additional bowls needed} = 24 - 7 = 17 \text{ bowls}
     \]

Thus, Carlos needs **17 more bowls** to place all the remaining almonds.",17.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the capacity of the tables**: 
   Each bowl can hold 24 almonds. 
   Each table can hold three times that, so:
   \[
   \text{Capacity of each table} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ almonds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and tables**:
   Carlos has 7 bowls and 3 tables, but 2 tables break, leaving him with:
   \[
   \text{Remaining tables} = 3 - 2 = 1 \text{ table}
   \]
   Now, we calculate the total capacity:

3. **Determine how many almonds Carlos has left after eating**:
   Carlos starts with 720 almonds. He eats one-fifth of all the almonds:
   \[
   \text{Almonds eaten} = \frac{1}{5} \times 720 = 144 \text{ almonds}

   So, the remaining almonds are:
   \[
   \text{Remaining almonds} = 720 - 144 = 576 \text{ almonds}

4. **Determine if the current capacity is enough**:
   The total capacity of the bowls and the remaining table is 240 almonds, but Carlos has 576 almonds left. 
   Since 576 > 240, he does not have enough capacity.

5. **Calculate how many more bowls are needed**:
   First, we find out how many more almonds need to be accommodated:
   \[
   \text{Almonds that need to be accommodated} = 576 - 240 = 336 \text{ almonds}

2. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed for Keisha's jackets.**
   - Each jacket requires 8 skeins, and she wants to make 2 jackets:
   \[
   8 \text{ skeins/jacket} × 2 \text{ jackets} = 16 \text{ skeins}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed overall.**
   \[
   164 \text{ skeins (for grandchildren)} + 16 \text{ skeins (for jackets)} = 180 \text{ skeins}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the skeins of wool.**
   - Each dozen skeins costs $7. First, we need to find out how many dozens are in 180 skeins:
   \[
   \frac{180 \text{ skeins}}{12 \text{ skeins/dozen}} = 15 \text{ dozens}
   \]
   - Now, we calculate the cost:
   \[
   15 \text{ dozens} × 7 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 105 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Apply the discount if applicable.**
   - Since the total cost of $105 is over $100, Keisha qualifies for a $20 discount:
   \[
   105 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 85 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Keisha should pay for all the skeins of wool she needs is **$85**.",85.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed for the grandchildren:**
   - For each grandchild, the wool needed is:
     - Shawl: 5 skeins
     - Sweater: 6 skeins
     - Poncho: 8 skeins
     - Gloves: 8 skeins
     - Mittens: 14 skeins
   - Total for one grandchild: 
     \( 5 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 14 = 41 \) skeins.
   - Since there are 4 grandchildren:
     \( 41 \times 4 = 164 \) skeins.

2. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed for Keisha:**
   - She wants to make 2 jackets, each needing 8 skeins:
     \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \) skeins.

3. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed overall:**
   - Total skeins for grandchildren + Total skeins for Keisha:
     \( 164 + 16 = 180 \) skeins.

4. **Calculate the cost of the skeins of wool:**
   - Each dozen skeins costs $7. 
   - First, find out how many dozens are in 180 skeins:
     \( 180 \div 12 = 15 \) dozens.
   - Now, calculate the cost:
     \( 15 \times 7 = 105 \) dollars.

5. **Check if the discount applies:**
   - The total cost is $105, which is over $100, so Keisha gets a $20 discount.
   - Calculate the final cost after the discount:
     \( 105 - 20 = 85 \) dollars.

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,Mohammed goes to the store to buy some rice. The normal brand of rice he buys costs ¥15 per kg. He has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 3 kgs of rice per day. The store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs; any additional rice is sold at the regular price. Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2. How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,"To find out how much Mohammed has to pay, we can break down the problem into several steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of rice Mohammed needs for a week:**
   - Mohammed uses 3 kg of rice per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he needs:
     \[
     3 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 21 \, \text{kg}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost of the more expensive brand of rice:**
   - The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg.
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more:
     \[
     \text{Cost of more expensive brand} = 15 + (0.20 \times 15) = 15 + 3 = ¥18 \, \text{per kg}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the first 10 kg of rice with the discount:**
   - The store has a 40% discount on rice up to 10 kg.
   - The discounted price per kg is:
     \[
     \text{Discounted price} = 18 - (0.40 \times 18) = 18 - 7.2 = ¥10.8 \, \text{per kg}
     \]
   - The cost for the first 10 kg is:
     \[
     10 \, \text{kg} \times 10.8 = ¥108
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the remaining rice (11 kg) at the regular price:**
   - The remaining amount of rice is:
     \[
     21 \, \text{kg} - 10 \, \text{kg} = 11 \, \text{kg}
     \]
   - The cost for the remaining 11 kg at the regular price (¥18 per kg) is:
     \[
     11 \, \text{kg} \times 18 = ¥198
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the rice:**
   - Total cost of rice:
     \[
     ¥108 + ¥198 = ¥306
     \]

6. **Add the cost of the bagel:**
   - The cost of the bagel is ¥2.
   - Total cost including the bagel:
     \[
     ¥306 + ¥2 = ¥308
     \]

Therefore, the total amount Mohammed has to pay is **¥308**.",308.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice:**
   - The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg.
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more.
   - 20% of ¥15 is \( 0.20 \times 15 = ¥3 \).
   - Therefore, the cost of the more expensive brand is \( 15 + 3 = ¥18 \) per kg.

2. **Calculate the total amount of rice Mohammed needs for a week:**
   - Mohammed uses 3 kgs of rice per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he needs \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) kgs of rice.

3. **Calculate the cost of the first 10 kgs of rice with the discount:**
   - The store has a 40% discount on the first 10 kgs.
   - The price after the discount for the first 10 kgs is \( 18 \times 0.60 = ¥10.80 \) per kg.
   - Therefore, the cost for 10 kgs is \( 10 \times 10.80 = ¥108 \).

4. **Calculate the cost of the remaining rice:**
   - Mohammed needs a total of 21 kgs, so he needs an additional \( 21 - 10 = 11 \) kgs.
   - The cost for these 11 kgs at the regular price is \( 11 \times 18 = ¥198 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the rice:**
   - The total cost for the rice is \( 108 + 198 = ¥306 \).

6. **Add the cost of the bagel:**
   - The bagel costs ¥2.
   - Therefore, the total amount Mohammed has to pay is \( 306 + 2 = ¥308 \).

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Jasmine and Mia are sisters from Nairobi who love collecting signatures from authors. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Jasmine and Mia compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Jasmine has 36 signatures in her book, and Mia has 31. The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,"To find out how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week to reach their goal of 145 signatures, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total signatures collected so far:**
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   - Mia has 31 signatures.
   - Total signatures collected = 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

2. **Determine the remaining signatures needed to reach the goal:**
   - Goal = 145 signatures.
   - Remaining signatures needed = 145 - 67 = 78 signatures.

3. **Determine Jasmine's collection over the next 2 weeks:**
   - Jasmine's current weekly collection is not given directly, but we know that she will collect 5 fewer signatures per week than she did before.
   - Let's denote Jasmine's original weekly collection as \( J \).
   - In the next 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect signatures only on weekends, which means she will collect \( J - 5 \) signatures each week.
   - Therefore, over 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect \( 2(J - 5) \) signatures.

4. **Calculate Mia's required collection:**
   - Let \( M \) be the number of signatures Mia collects per week.
   - Over the next 2 weeks, Mia will collect \( 2M \) signatures.
   - The total signatures collected by both sisters over the next 2 weeks will be:
     \[
     2(J - 5) + 2M
     \]
   - We want this total to equal the remaining signatures needed (78):
     \[
     2(J - 5) + 2M = 78
     \]

5. **Simplify the equation:**
   - Divide the entire equation by 2:
     \[
     J - 5 + M = 39
     \]
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     M = 39 - J + 5
     \]
     \[
     M = 44 - J
     \]

6. **Determine the value of \( J \):**
   - Since we don't have the exact value of \( J \), we can assume a reasonable value for Jasmine's original weekly collection. Let's assume Jasmine collected 10 signatures per week originally (this is a common assumption for such problems).
   - If \( J = 10 \):
     \[
     M = 44 - 10 = 34
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - If Jasmine originally collected 10 signatures per week, Mia would need to collect 34 signatures per week over the next 2 weeks to reach their goal of 145 signatures.
   - If Jasmine's original collection is different, you can adjust \( J \) accordingly and recalculate \( M \) using the formula \( M = 44 - J \).

Thus, Mia needs to collect **34 signatures per week** if Jasmine originally collected **10 signatures per week**. Adjust \( J \) as necessary based on the actual collection rate.",10.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Current Signatures**: 
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   - Mia has 31 signatures.
   - Together, they have 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

2. **Goal**: 
   - They want to reach a total of 145 signatures.

3. **Signatures Needed**: 
   - To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the current total from their goal:
   - 145 - 67 = 78 signatures needed.

4. **Remaining Time**: 
   - They have 2 more weeks of spring break.

5. **Jasmine's Collection**: 
   - Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 signatures per week. 
   - Let's assume she originally collected \( x \) signatures per week. 
   - Therefore, in the remaining 2 weeks, she will collect:
   - (x - 5) + (x - 5) = 2(x - 5) = 2x - 10 signatures.

6. **Mia's Collection**: 
   - Let \( y \) be the number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week.
   - In 2 weeks, Mia will collect:
   - 2y signatures.

7. **Total Signatures Collected in 2 Weeks**: 
   - The total signatures collected by both sisters in the remaining 2 weeks will be:
   - (2x - 10) + 2y.

8. **Setting Up the Equation**: 
   - We know they need a total of 78 more signatures, so we set up the equation:
   - (2x - 10) + 2y = 78.

9. **Solving for Mia's Collection**: 
   - Rearranging the equation gives us:
   - 2y = 78 - (2x - 10)
   - 2y = 78 - 2x + 10
   - 2y = 88 - 2x.

10. **Dividing by 2**: 
    - y = 44 - x.

11. **Conclusion**: 
    - Mia needs to collect \( 44 - x \) signatures per week, where \( x \) is Jasmine's original weekly collection. 
    - Since we don't have the exact value of \( x \), we can conclude that Mia's collection depends on Jasmine's original collection rate.

The answer is that Mia needs to collect \( 44 - x \) signatures per week, where \( x \) is Jasmine's original weekly collection.",44.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Jasmine currently has 36 signatures.
2. Mia currently has 31 signatures.
3. Together, they have collected: 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

5. The number of signatures they still need to collect is: 145 - 67 = 78 signatures.
6. They have 2 weeks left in their spring break.
7. Jasmine can only collect signatures on weekends, which means she will collect 5 signatures less per week than she normally would. Let's denote her normal weekly collection as \( J \).
8. Therefore, in the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect: \( 2(J - 5) \) signatures.
9. Mia needs to collect enough signatures to ensure they reach their goal. Let's denote Mia's weekly collection as \( M \).
10. In the remaining 2 weeks, Mia will collect: \( 2M \) signatures.
11. The total signatures collected by both sisters in the remaining 2 weeks must equal the signatures they still need: 
   \[
   2(J - 5) + 2M = 78
   \]
12. Simplifying this equation gives:
   \[
   2J - 10 + 2M = 78
   \]
   \[
   2J + 2M = 88
   \]
   \[
   J + M = 44
   \]
13. Since Jasmine's normal weekly collection is not specified, we can assume a reasonable value for \( J \). Let's say Jasmine normally collects 25 signatures per week. Then:
   \[
   25 + M = 44
   \]
   \[
   M = 44 - 25 = 19

It takes them 16 minutes to get to the corner where the cinema is. It takes them another 52 minutes to get to the gym. When they reach the gym, they remember they forgot their wallets at home, so they have to return to pick up their wallets and then walk all the way back to the gym again. Once they reach the gym for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the mall without being late?",42.0,"To find out how much time Sofia and Benjamin have left to get to the mall after returning to the gym, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Time to the cinema**: 16 minutes
2. **Time from the cinema to the gym**: 52 minutes

First, we calculate the total time taken to reach the gym the first time:

\[
\text{Total time to gym (first time)} = \text{Time to cinema} + \text{Time from cinema to gym} = 16 + 52 = 68 \text{ minutes}
\]

3. **Time to return home from the gym**: Since they have to return to pick up their wallets, we need to calculate the time taken to go back to their home from the gym. This will be the same as the time taken to go from the cinema to the gym, which is 52 minutes, plus the time taken to go from the cinema to home, which is 16 minutes. However, since they are going back directly from the gym to home, we only need the time from the gym to home, which is 52 minutes.

4. **Time to return to the gym**: After picking up their wallets, they need to walk back to the gym, which again takes 52 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total time spent before they reach the gym for the second time:

\[

He can make giant cubes that use 12 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 5 ounces, small cubes that use 1/2 of a ounce, and tiny cubes that are half the size of small cubes. He makes 48 total ice cubes, including 10 giant cubes, 14 small cubes, 12 medium cubes, and some tiny cubes. How many ounces of water does Leon have left?",122.0,"To find out how many ounces of water Leon has left after making the ice cubes, we first need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of ice cube he made.

1. **Calculate the water used for giant cubes:**
   - Number of giant cubes = 10
   - Water per giant cube = 12 ounces
   - Total water used for giant cubes = \(10 \times 12 = 120\) ounces

2. **Calculate the water used for medium cubes:**
   - Number of medium cubes = 12
   - Water per medium cube = 5 ounces
   - Total water used for medium cubes = \(12 \times 5 = 60\) ounces

3. **Calculate the water used for small cubes:**
   - Number of small cubes = 14
   - Water per small cube = 0.5 ounces
   - Total water used for small cubes = \(14 \times 0.5 = 7\) ounces

4. **Now, we need to find the total water used so far:**
   \[
   \text{Total water used} = \text{Water for giant cubes} + \text{Water for medium cubes} + \text{Water for small cubes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total water used} = 120 + 60 + 7 = 187 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total water used for tiny cubes:**
   - Let \(x\) be the number of tiny cubes.
   - Water per tiny cube = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 0.5 = 0.25\) ounces
   - Total water used for tiny cubes = \(x \times 0.25\) ounces

6. **Total number of ice cubes:**
   - Total ice cubes = 48
   - We have already counted 10 giant, 12 medium, and 14 small cubes, so:
   \[
   10 + 12 + 14 + x = 48

   \[
   36 + x = 48
   \]
   \[
   x = 48 - 36 = 12

8. **Calculate the total water used:**
   \[
   \text{Total water used} = 187 + 3 = 190 \text{ ounces}
   \]

9. **Calculate the remaining water:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining water} = 312 - 190 = 122 \text{ ounces}

Thus, the amount of water Leon has left is \(\boxed{122}\) ounces.",122.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Leon starts with 312 ounces of water.
2. He makes 10 giant cubes, and each giant cube uses 12 ounces of water.
   - The total water used for giant cubes is 10 * 12 = 120 ounces.
3. He makes 12 medium cubes, and each medium cube uses 5 ounces of water.
   - The total water used for medium cubes is 12 * 5 = 60 ounces.
4. He makes 14 small cubes, and each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water.
   - The total water used for small cubes is 14 * 0.5 = 7 ounces.
5. Now, let's calculate the total water used for all the cubes:
   - Total water used = water for giant cubes + water for medium cubes + water for small cubes
   - Total water used = 120 + 60 + 7 = 187 ounces.
6. To find out how much water Leon has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:
   - Water left = initial water - total water used
   - Water left = 312 - 187 = 125 ounces.

3. He makes 12 medium cubes, each using 5 ounces of water.
   - The total water used for medium cubes is:
   \[
   12 \times 5 = 60 \text{ ounces}

4. He makes 14 small cubes, each using 0.5 ounces of water.
   - The total water used for small cubes is:
   \[
   14 \times 0.5 = 7 \text{ ounces}

6. To find out how much water Leon has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:
   \[
   312 - 187 = 125 \text{ ounces}
   \]
7. Since the problem states that he makes a total of 48 ice cubes, we can find the number of tiny cubes made. The total number of cubes made so far is:
   \[
   10 \text{ (giant)} + 12 \text{ (medium)} + 14 \text{ (small)} = 36 \text{ cubes}

8. Therefore, the number of tiny cubes made is:
   \[
   48 - 36 = 12 \text{ tiny cubes}

9. Each tiny cube uses half the amount of water as a small cube, which is:
   \[
   0.5 \div 2 = 0.25 \text{ ounces}

10. The total water used for tiny cubes is:
    \[
    12 \times 0.25 = 3 \text{ ounces}

What percentage of the students like to play video games if the number of the students that like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football?",5.0,"To find the percentage of students who like to play video games, we first need to determine how many students like to bake and how many like to play video games.

1. **Identify the number of students with specific hobbies:**
   - Students who like to hike: 69
   - Students who like to play chess: 8
   - Students who like to swim: 13
   - Students who like to play football: 13

2. **Calculate the total number of students with known hobbies:**
   \[
   \text{Total with known hobbies} = 69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103
   \]

3. **Determine the number of students who like to bake:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of students who like to play football (which is given as 13). The number of students who like to bake is given as:
   \[
   \text{Number who like to bake} = 4x - 3 = 4(13) - 3 = 52 - 3 = 49
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of students who like to play video games:**
   The total number of students in the class is 160. Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total students} = \text{Total with known hobbies} + \text{Number who like to bake} + \text{Number who like to play video games}
   \]
   Let \( y \) be the number of students who like to play video games. Then:
   \[
   160 = 103 + 49 + y
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   160 = 152 + y
   \]
   \[
   y = 160 - 152 = 8
   \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of students who like to play video games:**
   The percentage of students who like to play video games is given by:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{y}{\text{Total students}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{8}{160} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = 0.05 \times 100 = 5\%
   \]

Thus, the percentage of students who like to play video games is \( \boxed{5\%} \).",5.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. We start with a class of 160 students.
2. The number of students who like to hike is 69.
3. The number of students who like to play chess is 8.
4. The number of students who like to swim is 13.
5. The number of students who like to play football is 13.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who have specified hobbies:

- Total students with specified hobbies = 69 (hike) + 8 (chess) + 13 (swim) + 13 (football)
- Total students with specified hobbies = 69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103

Next, we find out how many students are left who like either to play video games or bake:

- Students who like video games or bake = Total students - Students with specified hobbies
- Students who like video games or bake = 160 - 103 = 57

Now, we need to determine how many students like to bake. We know that the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number of students who like to play football:

- Number of students who like to play football = 13
- Four times the number of students who like to play football = 4 * 13 = 52
- Therefore, the number of students who like to bake = 52 - 3 = 49

Now, we can find the number of students who like to play video games:

- Students who like to play video games = Students who like video games or bake - Students who like to bake
- Students who like to play video games = 57 - 49 = 8

Finally, we calculate the percentage of students who like to play video games:

- Percentage of students who like to play video games = (Number of students who like to play video games / Total students) * 100
- Percentage of students who like to play video games = (8 / 160) * 100 = 5%

The crayon box has 12 different colors of crayon, and the sticker book has 6 pages, each with 12 stickers. The tower of stacking rings has 29 multicolored rings on it. Gabrielle recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of items for her nephew up to 320. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?",63.0,"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we first need to calculate the total number of items Gabrielle already has before adding the bouncy balls.

1. **Building Blocks**: 43 blocks
2. **Stuffed Animals**: 5 stuffed animals
3. **Action Figures**: The number of action figures is twice the number of blocks and stuffed animals combined. 
   - First, we calculate the total number of blocks and stuffed animals:
     \[
     43 + 5 = 48
     \]
   - Now, we find the number of action figures:
     \[
     2 \times 48 = 96 \text{ action figures}
     \]
4. **Crayons**: 12 different colors of crayon
5. **Stickers**: The sticker book has 6 pages, each with 12 stickers. So, the total number of stickers is:
   \[
   6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ stickers}
   \]
6. **Stacking Rings**: 29 multicolored rings

Now, we can sum all these items to find the total number of items Gabrielle has before adding the bouncy balls:

\[
\text{Total items} = \text{Building Blocks} + \text{Stuffed Animals} + \text{Action Figures} + \text{Crayons} + \text{Stickers} + \text{Stacking Rings}
\]
\[
\text{Total items} = 43 + 5 + 96 + 12 + 72 + 29

Calculating this step by step:

- \(43 + 5 = 48\)
- \(48 + 96 = 144\)
- \(144 + 12 = 156\)
- \(156 + 72 = 228\)
- \(228 + 29 = 257\)

So, Gabrielle has a total of 257 items before adding the bouncy balls.

Now, we know that after adding the bouncy balls, her total number of items is 320. Let \(x\) be the number of bouncy balls. We can set up the equation:

\[
257 + x = 320
\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 257 from both sides:

\[
x = 320 - 257

\[
x = 63

2. Next, we find the number of action figures.
   - The number of action figures is twice the number of blocks and stuffed animals combined.
   - So, the number of action figures is 2 * 48 = 96.

3. Now, we calculate the total number of crayons.
   - The crayon box has 12 different colors of crayon.
   - So, the total number of crayons is 12.

4. Next, we find the total number of stickers.
   - The sticker book has 6 pages, each with 12 stickers.
   - So, the total number of stickers is 6 * 12 = 72.

5. Now, we find the total number of stacking rings.
   - The tower of stacking rings has 29 multicolored rings.

6. Now, we add all these items together to find the total number of items Gabrielle has before adding the bouncy balls.
   - Total items = blocks + stuffed animals + action figures + crayons + stickers + stacking rings
   - Total items = 43 + 5 + 96 + 12 + 72 + 29 = 257.

7. Gabrielle's total number of items for her nephew is 320.

Due to the pandemic, 20 patients are admitted into the care facility each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks.",530.0,"To find the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rooms that are out of service.**
2. **Calculate the number of occupied rooms.**
3. **Calculate the number of unoccupied rooms.**
4. **Account for the daily admissions over 3 weeks.**
5. **Recalculate the number of unoccupied rooms after the admissions.**

### Step 1: Calculate the number of rooms that are out of service.

The total capacity of the care facility is 1900 rooms. One-fourth of these rooms are out of service:

\[
\text{Rooms out of service} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475 \text{ rooms}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of occupied rooms.

Since one-fourth of the total rooms are occupied, we calculate the number of occupied rooms:

\[
\text{Occupied rooms} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475 \text{ rooms}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of unoccupied rooms.

First, we need to find the total number of rooms that are either occupied or out of service:

\[
\text{Total occupied and out of service} = \text{Occupied rooms} + \text{Rooms out of service} = 475 + 475 = 950 \text{ rooms}
\]

Now, we can find the number of unoccupied rooms:

\[
\text{Unoccupied rooms} = \text{Total rooms} - \text{Total occupied and out of service} = 1900 - 950 = 950 \text{ rooms}
\]

### Step 4: Account for the daily admissions over 3 weeks.

Next, we need to calculate how many patients are admitted over 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in 3 weeks, there are:

\[
\text{Total days} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days}
\]

With 20 patients admitted each day, the total number of admissions over 3 weeks is:

\[
\text{Total admissions} = 20 \times 21 = 420 \text{ patients}
\]

### Step 5: Recalculate the number of unoccupied rooms after the admissions.

Now we need to subtract the total admissions from the initial number of unoccupied rooms:

\[
\text{Unoccupied rooms after admissions} = \text{Initial unoccupied rooms} - \text{Total admissions} = 950 - 420 = 530 \text{ rooms}
\]

### Final Answer

The total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks is:

\[
\boxed{530}
\]",530.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. The total capacity of the care facility is 1900 rooms.
2. One-fourth of the rooms are occupied. So, the number of occupied rooms is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475 \text{ rooms}
   \]
3. One-fourth of all the rooms are out of service. So, the number of rooms out of service is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475 \text{ rooms}
   \]
4. Now, we can calculate the total number of rooms that are either occupied or out of service:
   \[
   475 \text{ (occupied)} + 475 \text{ (out of service)} = 950 \text{ rooms}
   \]
5. To find the number of unoccupied rooms, we subtract the occupied and out of service rooms from the total capacity:
   \[
   1900 - 950 = 950 \text{ unoccupied rooms}
   \]
6. Next, we need to account for the 20 patients admitted each day for 3 weeks. First, we calculate the total number of days in 3 weeks:
   \[
   3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]
7. Now, we calculate the total number of patients admitted in 3 weeks:
   \[
   20 \text{ patients/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ patients}
   \]
8. Since these patients will occupy rooms, we need to subtract the number of patients from the unoccupied rooms:
   \[
   950 \text{ unoccupied rooms} - 420 \text{ patients} = 530 \text{ unoccupied rooms}

       - Total apricot pies sold over three days:
         \[
         8 + 21 + 94 = 123 \text{ boxes}
         \]
       - Total earnings from muffins:
         \[
         159 \times 9 = ₺1431

The answer is ₺1338.",1338.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. On Wednesday, Faisal sold 27 boxes of muffins.
2. He sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pies than on Thursday. Let's denote the number of apricot pies sold on Thursday as \( x \). Therefore, the number of apricot pies sold on Wednesday is \( x - 13 \).
3. On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday. So, the number of muffins sold on Thursday is \( 27 + 11 = 38 \).
4. We know that on Thursday, he sold 21 boxes of apricot pies. Therefore, \( x = 21 \).
5. Now we can find the number of apricot pies sold on Wednesday: \( 21 - 13 = 8 \).

Now we have:
- Wednesday: 27 muffins and 8 apricot pies.
- Thursday: 38 muffins and 21 apricot pies.

6. On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. Let's calculate the total sales for Wednesday and Thursday:
   - Total muffins sold = \( 27 + 38 = 65 \)
   - Total apricot pies sold = \( 8 + 21 = 29 \)
   - Total boxes sold over the two days = \( 65 + 29 = 94 \)

So, on Friday, he sold 94 boxes.

7. Now, let's calculate the earnings:
   - The cost of muffins is ₺9, and the cost of apricot pies is ₺21.
   - Earnings from muffins on Wednesday = \( 27 \times 9 = ₺243 \)
   - Earnings from apricot pies on Wednesday = \( 8 \times 21 = ₺168 \)
   - Earnings from muffins on Thursday = \( 38 \times 9 = ₺342 \)
   - Earnings from apricot pies on Thursday = \( 21 \times 21 = ₺441 \)
   - Earnings from muffins on Friday = \( 94 \times 9 = ₺846 \) (since all sold on Friday are muffins)
   - Earnings from apricot pies on Friday = \( 0 \) (since he sold only muffins)

8. Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
   - Total earnings = Earnings from Wednesday + Earnings from Thursday + Earnings from Friday
   - Total earnings = \( 243 + 168 + 342 + 441 + 846 = ₺2040 \)

9. Faisal worked for 3 days (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday), so we calculate the average daily earning:

5. **Boxes of pineapples:**
   - Each box contains 21 pineapples. To find out how many boxes Andre can sell:
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{1071}{21}
   \]
   Calculating this:
   \[
   1071 \div 21 = 51
   \]

6. **Total earnings from selling the boxes:**
   - Each box sells for $8:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 51 \times 8
   \]
   Calculating this:
   \[
   51 \times 8 = 408
   \]

Therefore, Andre is going to make **$408**.",408.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. On Saturday, Andre picks 177 pineapples.
2. On Sunday, he picks 183 pineapples.
3. On Monday, he picks double the number of pineapples he did on Saturday:
   - So, on Monday, he picks 2 * 177 = 354 pineapples.
4. Now, let's calculate the total number of pineapples picked over the three days:
   - Total = 177 (Saturday) + 183 (Sunday) + 354 (Monday) = 714 pineapples.
5. On Tuesday, he picks half the amount of what he picked in the past 3 days combined:
   - So, on Tuesday, he picks 714 / 2 = 357 pineapples.
6. Now, let's calculate the total number of pineapples Andre has after Tuesday:
   - Total pineapples = 177 + 183 + 354 + 357 = 1071 pineapples.
7. On Wednesday, he is going to sell the pineapples in boxes of 21 pineapples each:
   - Number of boxes = 1071 / 21 = 51 boxes (since 1071 divided by 21 equals 51 with no remainder).
8. He sells each box for $8:
   - Total money made = 51 boxes * $8 = $408.

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 50% for the second half. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?",1755.0,"To find out how many pizzas the family eats in two months, we will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the daily pizza consumption of each family member.

- Uncle: 10 pizzas/day
- Spouse: 20 pizzas/day

**Total for Uncle and Spouse:**
\[
10 + 20 = 30 \text{ pizzas/day}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the grandchild's pizza consumption.

The grandchild eats two-fourths (which is equivalent to one-half) of the combined number of pizzas eaten by the uncle and spouse.

**Grandchild's consumption:**
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ pizzas/day}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total daily pizza consumption for the family.

**Total family consumption:**
\[
30 + 15 = 45 \text{ pizzas/day}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total consumption for the first month.

Assuming one month has 30 days, the total consumption for the first month is:
\[
45 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 1350 \text{ pizzas}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the consumption for the second month.

#### First half of the second month (15 days):

They reduce their consumption by 60%. 

**New daily consumption:**
\[
45 \text{ pizzas/day} \times (1 - 0.60) = 45 \times 0.40 = 18 \text{ pizzas/day}
\]

**Total for the first half of the second month:**
\[
18 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 270 \text{ pizzas}
\]

#### Second half of the second month (15 days):

They further reduce their consumption by 50%.

**New daily consumption:**
\[
18 \text{ pizzas/day} \times (1 - 0.50) = 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \text{ pizzas/day}
\]

**Total for the second half of the second month:**
\[
9 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ pizzas}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total consumption for the second month.

**Total for the second month:**
\[
270 + 135 = 405 \text{ pizzas}
\]

### Step 7: Calculate the total consumption for both months.

**Total for both months:**
\[
1350 \text{ pizzas (first month)} + 405 \text{ pizzas (second month)} = 1755 \text{ pizzas}

     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ pizzas}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total daily pizza consumption for the family is:
     \[
     30 + 15 = 45 \text{ pizzas}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total pizza consumption for the first month:**
   - There are 30 days in a month.
   - The total number of pizzas eaten in the first month is:
     \[
     45 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 1350 \text{ pizzas}
     \]

3. **Calculate the pizza consumption for the second month:**
   - For the first half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by 60%:
     - The reduced consumption is:
     \[
     45 \text{ pizzas} \times (1 - 0.60) = 45 \times 0.40 = 18 \text{ pizzas/day}

1. **Total capacity of the Sports Arena**: 9600 seats
2. **Seats reserved for graduates**: 700 seats
3. **Seats reserved for faculty**: 450 seats
4. **Seats reserved for staff**: 50 seats

Now, we will calculate the total number of seats that are reserved:

\[
\text{Total reserved seats} = \text{Seats for graduates} + \text{Seats for faculty} + \text{Seats for staff}

Now, we need to determine how many tickets each graduate can receive. Since there are 700 graduates, we will divide the available seats for guests by the number of graduates:

\[
\text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{\text{Available seats for guests}}{\text{Number of graduates}}

The Sports Arena has a total capacity of 9600 people.  
First, we need to account for the seats that are already reserved:

- Seats for event staff: 50  

Now, let's add these reserved seats together:  
700 + 450 + 50 = 1200 reserved seats.  

Next, we subtract the reserved seats from the total capacity to find out how many seats are available for tickets:  
9600 - 1200 = 8400 available seats.  

Now, we need to determine how many graduates there are. Since each graduate can give tickets to their friends and family, we will assume that the number of graduates is 700 (as stated in the problem).  

To find out how many tickets each graduate can give, we divide the available seats by the number of graduates:  
8400 / 700 = 12.

Mohammed work overtime on the last day so he can respond to 10% more emails than usual.",61.0,"To find out how many emails Mohammed responds to in a 6-day work week, we can break the problem down into steps.

1. **Calculate the number of emails that require a response each day:**
   - Mohammed receives 30 emails a day.
   - 20% of those emails don't require a response.
   - The number of emails that don't require a response is:
     \[
     0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ emails}

   - Therefore, the number of emails that require a response is:
     \[
     30 - 6 = 24 \text{ emails}

2. **Determine how many emails Mohammed can respond to:**
   - Mohammed can respond to 2 less than half of the emails that require a response.
   - Half of the emails that require a response is:
     \[
     \frac{24}{2} = 12

   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ emails}

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Ananya walks 24 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 miles of walking on the beach and 14 miles of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?",85.0,"To solve the problem, we need to determine Ananya's walking speeds and the time she spends on each part of her walk.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( r \) be Ananya's original speed on the beach (in miles per hour).
   - Then her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2r \) (since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk).

2. **Injury Impact:**
   - After her injury, her speed on the beach becomes \( \frac{r}{2} \).
   - Her speed on the sidewalk becomes \( \frac{2r}{2} = r \).

3. **Time Spent on the Beach:**
   - We know that Ananya spends 50 minutes walking on the beach. We can convert this time into hours:
     \[
     \text{Time on beach} = \frac{50}{60} = \frac{5}{6} \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Distance on the Beach:**
   - The distance she walks on the beach is 10 miles. Using the formula for distance, \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \), we can express the speed on the beach:
     \[
     10 = \left(\frac{r}{2}\right) \times \frac{5}{6}
     \]
   - Solving for \( r \):
     \[
     10 = \frac{5r}{12}
     \]
     \[
     120 = 5r
     \]
     \[
     r = 24 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

5. **Calculate Speeds After Injury:**
   - Speed on the beach after injury:
     \[
     \text{Speed on beach} = \frac{r}{2} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]
   - Speed on the sidewalk after injury:
     \[
     \text{Speed on sidewalk} = r = 24 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

6. **Time Spent on the Sidewalk:**
   - The distance she walks on the sidewalk is 14 miles. Using the speed after injury:
     \[
     \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{14}{24} \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Converting this to minutes:
     \[
     \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{14}{24} \times 60 = \frac{14 \times 60}{24} = \frac{840}{24} = 35 \text{ minutes}
     \]

7. **Total Time for the Walk:**
   - Now, we can find the total time for the entire 24-mile walk:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 50 \text{ minutes} + 35 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes}

Thus, the total time it takes for Ananya to complete her entire 24-mile walk is \( \boxed{85} \) minutes.",85.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Ananya walks a total of 24 miles every day, which includes 10 miles on the beach and 14 miles on the sidewalk.

2. We know that Ananya spends 50 minutes walking on the beach. 

3. Since she walks 10 miles on the beach in 50 minutes, we can calculate her speed on the beach:
   - Speed on the beach = Distance / Time = 10 miles / (50 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) = 10 miles / (50/60) hours = 10 miles / (5/6) hours = 10 * (6/5) = 12 miles per hour.

4. On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at twice the speed of her beach speed. Therefore, her original speed on the sidewalk would be:
   - Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * Speed on the beach = 2 * 12 miles per hour = 24 miles per hour.

5. However, due to her injury, her speed has decreased by half. So, her current speed on the sidewalk is:
   - Current speed on the sidewalk = 24 miles per hour / 2 = 12 miles per hour.

6. Now, we need to calculate the time it takes for her to walk the 14 miles on the sidewalk at her current speed:
   - Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 14 miles / 12 miles per hour = 14 / 12 hours = 7/6 hours.

7. To convert this time into minutes, we multiply by 60:
   - Time on the sidewalk in minutes = (7/6) hours * 60 minutes/hour = 70 minutes.

8. Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the entire 24-mile walk:
   - Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk = 50 minutes + 70 minutes = 120 minutes.

The answer is 120 minutes.",120.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Ananya walks a total of 24 miles every day, which includes 10 miles on the beach and 14 miles on the sidewalk.

   - Speed on the beach = Distance / Time = 10 miles / (50 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) = 10 miles / (5/6 hours) = 10 * (6/5) = 12 miles per hour.
4. However, due to her injury, her speed has decreased by half. So, her new speed on the beach is:
   - New speed on the beach = 12 miles per hour / 2 = 6 miles per hour.
5. Now, let's calculate the time it takes her to walk the 10 miles on the beach at her new speed:
   - Time on the beach = Distance / Speed = 10 miles / 6 miles per hour = 10/6 hours = 5/3 hours = (5/3) * 60 minutes = 100 minutes.
6. Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, her speed on the sidewalk before the injury was:
   - Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * 12 miles per hour = 24 miles per hour.
7. After her injury, her speed on the sidewalk is:
   - New speed on the sidewalk = 24 miles per hour / 2 = 12 miles per hour.
8. Now, we calculate the time it takes her to walk the 14 miles on the sidewalk at her new speed:
   - Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 14 miles / 12 miles per hour = 14/12 hours = 7/6 hours = (7/6) * 60 minutes = 70 minutes.
9. Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for her 24-mile walk:

Mei finds twice as many as Elena. Xavier finds 2 less than Mei. Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier, and Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined. How many cookies are still hidden in the yard?",64.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of cookies**: Amelia had 11 dozen cookies.
   \[
   11 \text{ dozen} = 11 \times 12 = 132 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. **Cookies eaten by Amelia**: She ate 5 cookies for breakfast.
   \[
   132 - 5 = 127 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. **Cookies hidden in the yard**: After eating, Amelia hid 127 cookies in the yard.

4. **Cookies found by Elena**: Elena finds 5 cookies.
   \[
   \text{Elena's cookies} = 5
   \]

5. **Cookies found by Mei**: Mei finds twice as many as Elena.
   \[
   \text{Mei's cookies} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

6. **Cookies found by Xavier**: Xavier finds 2 less than Mei.
   \[
   \text{Xavier's cookies} = 10 - 2 = 8
   \]

7. **Cookies found by Mohammed**: Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier.
   \[
   \text{Mohammed's cookies} = \frac{8}{8} = 1

8. **Cookies found by Umar**: Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined.
   - First, calculate the total cookies found by Mei and Elena:
   \[
   \text{Mei's cookies} + \text{Elena's cookies} = 10 + 5 = 15

   - Now, calculate Umar's cookies:
   \[
   \text{Umar's cookies} = 15 + 2 \times 12 = 15 + 24 = 39

6. Xavier finds 2 less than Mei:
   \[
   \text{Xavier's cookies} = 10 - 2 = 8
   \]

7. Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier:
   \[
   \text{Mohammed's cookies} = \frac{8}{8} = 1
   \]

8. Now, we calculate how many cookies Mei and Elena have combined:
   \[
   \text{Mei's cookies} + \text{Elena's cookies} = 10 + 5 = 15

   Therefore, Umar finds:
   \[
   \text{Umar's cookies} = 15 + 24 = 39

If they work for 8 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?",50.0,"To determine the percentage of the janitor's day spent cleaning rooms, we first need to calculate the total time required to clean all 200 rooms with the new cleaning time per room.

1. **Calculate the new time per room:**
   - Originally, it took 6 minutes per room.
   - Due to the injury, it now takes twice as long:
     \[
     \text{New time per room} = 6 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 12 \text{ minutes}

2. **Calculate the total time to clean all rooms:**
   - There are 200 rooms, so the total time required is:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 200 \text{ rooms} \times 12 \text{ minutes/room} = 2400 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Convert total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
     \[
     \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{2400 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 40 \text{ hours}

   \[
   6 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 12 \text{ minutes per room}

3. To find out how long it will take to clean all 200 rooms, we multiply the time per room by the number of rooms:
   \[
   200 \text{ rooms} \times 12 \text{ minutes per room} = 2400 \text{ minutes}

3. To find out how long it will take to clean all 200 rooms, we multiply the time per room by the number of rooms: 
   12 minutes/room * 200 rooms = 2400 minutes.

   B - O = 24 \implies B - 35 = 24 \implies B = 24 + 35 = 59
   \]

3. **Determine Keisha's current age**:
   We also know that Olivia and Keisha are currently 15 years apart, and since Olivia is older than Keisha:
   \[
   O - K = 15 \implies 35 - K = 15 \implies K = 35 - 15 = 20
   \]

4. **Calculate the average age of all three**:
   Now we can find the average age of Olivia, Bodhi, and Keisha:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{O + B + K}{3} = \frac{35 + 59 + 20}{3} = \frac{114}{3} = 38
   \]

5. **Determine how much younger Keisha is than the average age**:
   Now we find how much younger Keisha is than the average age:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Average age} - K = 38 - 20 = 18
   \]

Thus, Keisha is **18 years younger** than the average age of all three.",18.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine Olivia's current age**: 
   - Olivia will be 42 in 7 years. 
   - Therefore, her current age is 42 - 7 = 35 years.

2. **Determine Bodhi's current age**: 
   - Olivia is 24 years younger than Bodhi.
   - So, Bodhi's current age is 35 + 24 = 59 years.

3. **Determine Keisha's current age**: 
   - Olivia is 15 years older than Keisha.
   - Therefore, Keisha's current age is 35 - 15 = 20 years.

4. **Calculate the average age of Olivia, Bodhi, and Keisha**: 
   - The total age of all three is 35 (Olivia) + 59 (Bodhi) + 20 (Keisha) = 114 years.
   - The average age is 114 / 3 = 38 years.

5. **Determine how much younger Keisha is than the average age**: 
   - The average age is 38 years, and Keisha is currently 20 years old.
   - The difference is 38 - 20 = 18 years.

The answer is 18.",18.0,1,,18.0,1
