But as I pour it, I spill 7 liters of the mango drink. To make up for that, I add 7 liters of water to the mix. What percentage of the final mix is water?",50.0,"To find the percentage of water in the final mix, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the mango drink.**
   - The mango drink is 16 liters and is one-ninth water.
   - Amount of water in the mango drink = \( \frac{1}{9} \times 16 = \frac{16}{9} \) liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the apple drink.**
   - The apple drink is 14 liters and is one-half water.
   - Amount of water in the apple drink = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7 \) liters.

3. **Calculate the total amount of water before the spill.**
   - Total water before the spill = water in mango drink + water in apple drink
   - Total water = \( \frac{16}{9} + 7 \).

   To add these, we convert 7 to a fraction with a denominator of 9:
   \[
   7 = \frac{63}{9}
   \]
   Now, we can add:
   \[
   \text{Total water} = \frac{16}{9} + \frac{63}{9} = \frac{79}{9} \text{ liters}.
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount of mango drink after the spill.**
   - Initially, there are 16 liters of mango drink, but 7 liters are spilled.
   - Remaining mango drink = \( 16 - 7 = 9 \) liters.

5. **Calculate the amount of water in the remaining mango drink.**
   - The remaining mango drink is still one-ninth water.
   - Amount of water in the remaining mango drink = \( \frac{1}{9} \times 9 = 1 \) liter.

6. **Calculate the total amount of water after the spill and addition of water.**
   - Total water after the spill = water from remaining mango drink + water from apple drink + added water
   - Total water = \( 1 + 7 + \frac{79}{9} - 7 \) (since we already counted the 7 liters of water in the apple drink).
   - Total water = \( 1 + 7 + \frac{79}{9} = 1 + \frac{63}{9} + \frac{79}{9} = 1 + \frac{142}{9} \).

   Converting 1 to a fraction with a denominator of 9:
   \[
   1 = \frac{9}{9}
   \]
   Now, we can add:
   \[
   \text{Total water} = \frac{9}{9} + \frac{142}{9} = \frac{151}{9} \text{ liters}.
   \]

7. **Calculate the total volume of the final mix.**
   - Total volume = remaining mango drink + apple drink + added water
   - Total volume = \( 9 + 14 + 7 = 30 \) liters.

8. **Calculate the percentage of water in the final mix.**
   - Percentage of water = \( \left( \frac{\text{Total water}}{\text{Total volume}} \right) \times 100 \)
   - Percentage of water = \( \left( \frac{\frac{151}{9}}{30} \right) \times 100 \).

   First, simplify \( \frac{151}{9} \div 30 \):
   \[
   \frac{151}{9} \div 30 = \frac{151}{9 \times 30} = \frac{151}{270}.
   \]
   Now, calculate the percentage:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of water} = \left( \frac{151}{270} \right) \times 100 \approx 55.93\%.

If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 10 hours if she spends 2/5 of the time running, 1/2 of the time skipping, and the remaining of the time walking?",27.0,"To solve the problem, we first need to determine Mei's speeds for running, skipping, and walking.

1. **Determine Mei's skipping speed:**
   - We know that Mei can skip at a speed of 2 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Mei's running speed:**
   - It is given that she can skip at a rate that is 1/2 as fast as she can run. Therefore, if her skipping speed is 2 mph, her running speed can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

3. **Determine Mei's walking speed:**
   - It is also given that Mei can run four times faster than she can walk. Therefore, if her running speed is 4 mph, her walking speed can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

Now we have the following speeds:
- Walking speed: 1 mph
- Skipping speed: 2 mph
- Running speed: 4 mph

4. **Determine the time spent on each activity:**
   - The total time is 10 hours.
   - Time spent running: 
   \[
   \text{Time running} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10 = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]
   - Time spent skipping: 
   \[
   \text{Time skipping} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]
   - Time spent walking: 
   \[
   \text{Time walking} = 10 - \left(4 + 5\right) = 10 - 9 = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

5. **Calculate the distance traveled in each activity:**
   - Distance running:
   \[
   \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 4 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
   \]
   - Distance skipping:
   \[
   \text{Distance skipping} = \text{Skipping speed} \times \text{Time skipping} = 2 \text{ mph} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ miles}
   \]
   - Distance walking:
   \[
   \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 1 \text{ mile}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance skipping} + \text{Distance walking} = 16 + 10 + 1 = 27 \text{ miles}
   \]

Thus, the total distance Mei can travel in 10 hours is \(\boxed{27}\) miles.",27.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine Mei's running speed**: 
   - We know that she can skip at 2 miles per hour.
   - Since she skips at a rate that is 1/2 as fast as she can run, we can find her running speed by doubling her skipping speed.
   - Running speed = 2 * 2 miles per hour = 4 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Mei's walking speed**: 
   - Mei can run four times faster than she can walk.
   - Therefore, her walking speed = Running speed / 4 = 4 miles per hour / 4 = 1 mile per hour.

3. **Calculate the total time spent running, skipping, and walking**:
   - The total time is 10 hours.
   - Time spent running = (2/5) of 10 hours = (2/5) * 10 = 4 hours.
   - Time spent skipping = (1/2) of 10 hours = (1/2) * 10 = 5 hours.
   - The remaining time is for walking: 
     - Total time = 10 hours
     - Time spent running + Time spent skipping = 4 hours + 5 hours = 9 hours.
     - Time spent walking = 10 hours - 9 hours = 1 hour.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled in each activity**:
   - Distance running = Speed * Time = 4 miles per hour * 4 hours = 16 miles.
   - Distance skipping = Speed * Time = 2 miles per hour * 5 hours = 10 miles.
   - Distance walking = Speed * Time = 1 mile per hour * 1 hour = 1 mile.

If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?",180.0,"To determine how many ounces of cookies you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume**:
   - Your daily calorie target is 2300 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1200 calories.
   - You have burned 100 calories through exercise.

   The effective calories consumed after exercise is:
   \[
   \text{Effective calories consumed} = 1200 - 100 = 1100 \text{ calories}
   \]

   Now, calculate the remaining calories:
   \[
   \text{Remaining calories} = 2300 - 1100 = 1200 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the calories per serving of cookies**:
   - Each serving of cookies has 200 calories.

3. **Calculate how many servings you can consume with the remaining calories**:
   \[
   \text{Number of servings} = \frac{\text{Remaining calories}}{\text{Calories per serving}} = \frac{1200}{200} = 6 \text{ servings}
   \]

4. **Find out how many ounces of cookies this corresponds to**:
   - The bag contains 5 servings and has a total weight of 150 oz.
   - Therefore, each serving weighs:
   \[
   \text{Weight per serving} = \frac{150 \text{ oz}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 30 \text{ oz per serving}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total ounces you can eat**:
   \[
   \text{Total ounces} = \text{Number of servings} \times \text{Weight per serving} = 6 \times 30 = 180 \text{ oz}
   \]

However, since the bag only contains 150 oz, you cannot eat 180 oz. You can only eat the entire bag of cookies, which is 150 oz.

**Conclusion**: You can eat the entire 150 oz bag of cookies, but that would exceed your calorie target. Therefore, you need to adjust your servings to fit within the 1200 remaining calories. 

To find out how many ounces you can actually eat without exceeding your calorie limit, you can calculate the maximum ounces based on the calories:

- Each ounce of cookies has:
\[
\text{Calories per ounce} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{30 \text{ oz}} \approx 6.67 \text{ calories per oz}
\]

Now, calculate how many ounces you can eat with the remaining 1200 calories:
\[
\text{Ounces you can eat} = \frac{1200 \text{ calories}}{6.67 \text{ calories per oz}} \approx 180 \text{ oz}
\]

Since you cannot eat more than the bag contains, the maximum you can eat is 150 oz, which is the total amount in the bag. 

Thus, the answer is that you can eat **150 oz of cookies**.",150.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many calories are left in the daily calorie target after consuming some calories and exercising.
   - Daily calorie target: 2300 calories
   - Calories already consumed: 1200 calories
   - Calories burned through exercise: 100 calories

   So, the remaining calories are:
   \[
   2300 - 1200 + 100 = 1200 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many calories are in one serving of cookies.
   - Each serving has 200 calories.

3. Now, we can calculate how many servings can be consumed with the remaining calories.
   - Remaining calories: 1200 calories
   - Calories per serving: 200 calories

   The number of servings that can be consumed is:
   \[
   \frac{1200}{200} = 6 \text{ servings}
   \]

4. Finally, we need to find out how many ounces correspond to these 6 servings. Since the bag has 5 servings and weighs 150 oz, we can find the weight per serving:
   - Weight of the bag: 150 oz
   - Number of servings in the bag: 5 servings

   The weight per serving is:
   \[
   \frac{150 \text{ oz}}{5} = 30 \text{ oz per serving}

1. Kayla received 43 new potted plants from the nursery.
2. She already has 12 potted plants on each of the 65 window ledges.
   - To find the total number of potted plants she has from the window ledges, we calculate:
     \( 12 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 65 \text{ ledges} = 780 \text{ plants} \).
3. Now, we add the new plants she received to the plants she already has:
   - Total plants after receiving new ones:
     \( 780 + 43 = 823 \text{ plants} \).
4. She purchased 140 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount. However, the discount does not affect the number of plants she has, so we simply add these to her total:
   - Total plants after the purchase:
     \( 823 + 140 = 963 \text{ plants} \).
5. Kayla plans to give away 4 potted plants from each of the 65 ledges:
   - Total plants given away:
     \( 4 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 65 \text{ ledges} = 260 \text{ plants} \).

If the city is 18 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/3 of the city?",82.0,"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover 1/3 of the city, we first need to find out how many miles that represents.

The city is 18 miles across, so:

\[
\text{1/3 of the city} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we know that the fog bank takes 41 minutes to cover every 3 miles. We can calculate how many 3-mile segments are in 6 miles:

\[
\text{Number of 3-mile segments in 6 miles} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 2 \text{ segments}

On Monday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. On Tuesday, he finished homework early and watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. On Wednesday, he got to stay up late, so he watched two 5-hour episodes. On Thursday, he watched four episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 24 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?",5.0,"To find out how many 15-minute episodes Noah watched on Monday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he spent watching TV from Saturday to Thursday, and then determine how much time was left for the 15-minute episodes on Monday.

1. **Saturday and Sunday:**
   - He watched 4 hours each night for 2 nights.
   - Total time for Saturday and Sunday: 
     \[
     4 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Monday:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of 15-minute episodes he watched.
   - Each 15-minute episode is \( \frac{15}{60} = \frac{1}{4} \) hours.
   - Total time for Monday: 
     \[
     \frac{x}{4} \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Tuesday:**
   - He watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show.
   - Total time for Tuesday:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} + 0.75 \text{ hours} = 3.75 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Wednesday:**
   - He watched two 5-hour episodes.
   - Total time for Wednesday:
     \[
     5 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Thursday:**
   - He watched four 15-minute episodes.
   - Total time for Thursday:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{15}{60} = 4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1 \text{ hour}
     \]

Now, we can sum the total time spent watching TV from Saturday to Thursday:

\[
\text{Total time} = 8 \text{ hours (Saturday and Sunday)} + \frac{x}{4} \text{ hours (Monday)} + 3.75 \text{ hours (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ hours (Wednesday)} + 1 \text{ hour (Thursday)}
\]

This gives us the equation:

\[
8 + \frac{x}{4} + 3.75 + 10 + 1 = 24
\]

Now, we simplify the left side:

\[
8 + 3.75 + 10 + 1 = 22.75
\]

So, we have:

\[
22.75 + \frac{x}{4} = 24
\]

Subtracting 22.75 from both sides:

\[
\frac{x}{4} = 24 - 22.75
\]
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 1.25
\]

Now, multiplying both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 1.25 \times 4 = 5
\]

Thus, Noah watched **5** 15-minute episodes on Monday.",15.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Total TV time**: Noah watched a total of 24 hours of TV.

2. **Saturday and Sunday**: He watched 4-hour episodes each night for two nights.
   - Total for Saturday and Sunday = 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours.

3. **Monday**: He watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. We will denote the number of 15-minute episodes he watched as \( x \).
   - Each 15-minute episode is \( \frac{15}{60} = 0.25 \) hours.
   - So, the total time spent on Monday = \( 0.25x \) hours.

4. **Tuesday**: He watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show.
   - 45 minutes is \( \frac{45}{60} = 0.75 \) hours.
   - Total for Tuesday = 3 hours + 0.75 hours = 3.75 hours.

5. **Wednesday**: He watched two 5-hour episodes.
   - Total for Wednesday = 5 hours + 5 hours = 10 hours.

6. **Thursday**: He watched four episodes, each 15 minutes.
   - Total for Thursday = 4 episodes * 0.25 hours = 1 hour.

7. **Now, we can set up the equation** for the total TV time:
   \[
   8 \text{ (Saturday and Sunday)} + 0.25x \text{ (Monday)} + 3.75 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1 \text{ (Thursday)} = 24

8. **Combine the known values**:
   \[
   8 + 3.75 + 10 + 1 = 22.75

   So, the equation simplifies to:
   \[
   22.75 + 0.25x = 24

9. **Subtract 22.75 from both sides**:
   \[
   0.25x = 24 - 22.75

If she used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.",504.0,"To solve the problem, we need to break down the information given and set up equations based on the ratios provided.

1. **Understanding the Ratios**:
   - The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 63:14.
   - The ratio of tablespoons of milk to cups of water is 9:7.

2. **Let’s define variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of cups of water used.
   - From the ratio of sugar to water, the amount of sugar used can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{sugar} = \frac{63}{14} \cdot x = \frac{63x}{14} = 4.5x
     \]
   - From the ratio of milk to water, the amount of milk used can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{milk} = \frac{9}{7} \cdot x
     \]

3. **Total Ingredients**:
   - The total amount of ingredients used is given as 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk:
     \[
     \text{sugar} + \text{water} + \text{milk} = 760
     \]
   - Substituting the expressions for sugar and milk:
     \[
     4.5x + x + \frac{9}{7}x = 760
     \]

4. **Combining Terms**:
   - First, combine the terms involving \( x \):
     \[
     4.5x + x = 5.5x
     \]
   - Now, we need to combine \( 5.5x \) and \( \frac{9}{7}x \):
     - To do this, we convert \( 5.5 \) to a fraction:
       \[
       5.5 = \frac{11}{2}
       \]
     - Now, we find a common denominator to combine \( \frac{11}{2}x \) and \( \frac{9}{7}x \):
       - The least common multiple of 2 and 7 is 14.
       - Convert \( \frac{11}{2} \) to have a denominator of 14:
         \[
         \frac{11}{2} = \frac{11 \times 7}{2 \times 7} = \frac{77}{14}
         \]
       - Convert \( \frac{9}{7} \) to have a denominator of 14:
         \[
         \frac{9}{7} = \frac{9 \times 2}{7 \times 2} = \frac{18}{14}
         \]
     - Now we can combine:
       \[
       \frac{77}{14}x + \frac{18}{14}x = \frac{95}{14}x
       \]

5. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - Now we have:
     \[
     \frac{95}{14}x = 760
     \]

6. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - Multiply both sides by 14 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     95x = 760 \times 14
     \]
   - Calculate \( 760 \times 14 \):
     \[
     760 \times 14 = 10640
     \]
   - Now divide by 95:
     \[
     x = \frac{10640}{95} = 112
     \]

7. **Calculating the Amount of Sugar**:
   - Now that we have \( x = 112 \) (the number of cups of water), we can find the amount of sugar:
     \[
     \text{sugar} = 4.5x = 4.5 \times 112 = 504
     \]

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Fatima used is \( \boxed{504} \).",504.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Understanding the ratios**: Fatima uses sugar and water in the ratio of 63:14. This means for every 63 teaspoons of sugar, there are 14 cups of water.

2. **Finding the total parts in the sugar and water ratio**: 
   - Total parts = 63 (sugar) + 14 (water) = 77 parts.

3. **Finding the total amount of sugar and water used**: 
   - Let \( x \) be the multiplier for the ratio. 
   - Then, the amount of sugar used is \( 63x \) teaspoons and the amount of water used is \( 14x \) cups.

4. **Understanding the milk ratio**: Fatima uses 9 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water. 

5. **Finding the total parts in the milk and water ratio**: 
   - Total parts = 9 (milk) + 7 (water) = 16 parts.

6. **Finding the total amount of milk used**: 
   - Since we already have \( 14x \) cups of water, we can find how many sets of the milk ratio fit into this amount:
   - Each set of the milk ratio uses 7 cups of water, so the number of sets is \( \frac{14x}{7} = 2x \).
   - Therefore, the amount of milk used is \( 9 \times 2x = 18x \) tablespoons.

7. **Setting up the equation for the total**: 
   - The total amount used is the sum of sugar, water, and milk:
   \[
   63x + 14x + 18x = 760
   \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   95x = 760
   \]

8. **Solving for \( x \)**: 
   - Dividing both sides by 95:
   \[
   x = \frac{760}{95} = 8
   \]

9. **Calculating the amount of sugar used**: 
   - Now, substituting \( x \) back into the sugar equation:
   \[
   \text{Sugar used} = 63x = 63 \times 8 = 504 \text{ teaspoons}

3. **Calculate the cost of the bond paper:**
   - The cost of the rim of bond paper is ₣10.00.

4. **Calculate the cost of the crayons:**
   - Arjun bought 3 crayons.
   - Each crayon costs ₣11.00.
   - So, the total cost for the crayons is:
     \[
     3 \times 11.00 = 33.00
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost before discount:**
   - Now, we add all the costs together:
     \[
     33.00 \, (\text{notebooks}) + 54.00 \, (\text{rulers}) + 10.00 \, (\text{bond paper}) + 33.00 \, (\text{crayons}) = 130.00

1. **Calculate the lost income if Isabella does her taxes herself:**
   - She will lose 12 hours of consulting work at a rate of ₣82/hour.
   - Lost income from consulting work = 12 hours * ₣82/hour = ₣984.

2. **Calculate the additional time spent mailing the tax documents:**

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,Luis is rolling a 20-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row?,43.75,"To solve the problem, we need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 on a 20-sided die, and the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 10:**
   A 20-sided die has the numbers 1 through 20. The numbers greater than 10 are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. 

   There are 10 numbers greater than 10. Therefore, the probability \( P(\text{greater than 10}) \) is:
   \[
   P(\text{greater than 10}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
   \]

2. **Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row:**
   The odd numbers on a 20-sided die are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19. There are 10 odd numbers.

   The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is:
   \[
   P(\text{odd}) = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
   \]

   Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row is:
   \[
   P(\text{four odd numbers}) = P(\text{odd})^4 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16}
   \]

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   Now we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 10 compared to rolling four odd numbers in a row. We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Difference in probabilities} = P(\text{greater than 10}) - P(\text{four odd numbers}) = 0.5 - \frac{1}{16}
   \]

   To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The common denominator of 1 and 16 is 16. Thus, we convert 0.5 to a fraction with a denominator of 16:
   \[
   0.5 = \frac{8}{16}
   \]

   Now we can subtract:
   \[
   \frac{8}{16} - \frac{1}{16} = \frac{8 - 1}{16} = \frac{7}{16}
   \]

4. **Expressing the difference as a percentage:**
   To express \(\frac{7}{16}\) as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
   \[
   \frac{7}{16} \times 100 = 43.75\%
   \]

Thus, Luis is **43.75%** more likely to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll four odd numbers in a row.",10.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 on a 20-sided die.**
   - The numbers on a 20-sided die are 1 through 20.
   - The numbers greater than 10 are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
   - There are 10 numbers greater than 10.
   - The total number of outcomes when rolling the die is 20.
   - So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is:
     \[
     P(\text{greater than 10}) = \frac{10}{20} = 0.5 \text{ or } 50\%
     \]

2. **Determine the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row.**
   - The odd numbers on a 20-sided die are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19.
   - There are 10 odd numbers.
   - The probability of rolling an odd number on one roll is:
     \[
     P(\text{odd}) = \frac{10}{20} = 0.5
     \]
   - To find the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row, we multiply the probabilities of rolling an odd number for each of the four rolls:
     \[
     P(\text{four odd numbers}) = P(\text{odd})^4 = (0.5)^4 = 0.0625 \text{ or } 6.25\%
     \]

3. **Calculate how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll four odd numbers in a row.**
   - We subtract the probability of rolling four odd numbers from the probability of rolling a number greater than 10:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = P(\text{greater than 10}) - P(\text{four odd numbers}) = 0.5 - 0.0625 = 0.4375

He can write a page every 14 minutes. On average, how many hours does Yuki spend writing in a day?",4.0,"To find out how many hours Yuki spends writing in a day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Yuki is still corresponding with:**
   - Yuki originally had 8 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 4 of them.
   - Therefore, the number of pen pals he still corresponds with is:
     \[
     8 - 4 = 4

3. **Calculate the total costs**:
   - Registration Fees: $16,200
   - Agent Fee: $32,400
   - Remaining Loan Amount: $260,000
   - Closing Costs: $5,000

Thus, Prof. Johnson's net proceeds from selling the apartment are **$236,400**.",236400.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Prof. Johnson sold his apartment for $540,000.
2. He paid registration fees of 3% of the selling price:
   - Registration fees = 3% of $540,000 = 0.03 * 540,000 = $16,200.
3. He also paid an agent fee of 6% of the selling price:
   - Agent fee = 6% of $540,000 = 0.06 * 540,000 = $32,400.
4. He paid $260,000 for the remaining loan amount of the apartment.
5. He paid $5,000 for closing costs.

Now, let's calculate the total costs:
- Total costs = Registration fees + Agent fee + Loan amount + Closing costs
- Total costs = $16,200 + $32,400 + $260,000 + $5,000 = $313,600.

The roller coaster costs €10 per ride. For the transportation of the birthday party guests, Emma needs to rent a bus for the day, which costs €60. How many friends can she invite?",2.0,"To determine how many friends Emma can invite to her birthday party, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and then see how many friends can be accommodated within her budget of €180.

1. **Calculate the cost of one round of laser tag for Emma and her friends:**
   - Cost of one round of laser tag: €6
   - Let \( n \) be the number of friends Emma invites. Therefore, the total number of participants (Emma + friends) is \( n + 1 \).
   - Total cost for laser tag: \( 6(n + 1) \)

2. **Calculate the cost of pinball tokens for Emma and her friends:**
   - Cost of pinball tokens per person: €4
   - Total cost for pinball tokens: \( 4(n + 1) \)

3. **Calculate the cost of roller coaster rides for Emma and her friends:**

   - Total rides for each person: 3
   - Total cost for roller coaster rides: \( 10 \times 3(n + 1) = 30(n + 1) \)

4. **Calculate the cost of transportation:**
   - Cost of renting the bus: €60

5. **Set up the total cost equation:**
   The total cost for the party can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Laser Tag} + \text{Cost of Pinball Tokens} + \text{Cost of Roller Coaster} + \text{Cost of Bus}

   - **Pinball Tokens**: Each friend needs €4 in pinball tokens.
   - **Roller Coaster**: Each ride costs €10, and Emma wants to ride it 3 times. So, the cost for the roller coaster for each person is 3 * €10 = €30.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - Let \( n \) be the number of friends Emma invites. Including Emma, there are \( n + 1 \) people.
   - The total cost for laser tag for \( n + 1 \) people is \( (n + 1) * €6 \).

4. **Calculate the calories from the sugar:**
   - Each teaspoon of sugar adds 6 calories.
   \[
   \text{Calories from sugar} = 9 \text{ teaspoons} \times 6 \text{ calories/teaspoon} = 54 \text{ calories}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total calories consumed:**
   \[
   \text{Total calories} = \text{Calories from soda} + \text{Calories from sugar} = 126 \text{ calories} + 54 \text{ calories} = 180 \text{ calories}

Thus, Diego consumed a total of **180 calories**.",180.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Each bottle of soda contains 7 mL of soda.
2. Diego drinks 3 bottles of soda.
   - So, the total amount of soda he drinks is 3 * 7 mL = 21 mL.
3. The soda has 6 calories per mL.
   - Therefore, the total calories from the soda is 21 mL * 6 calories/mL = 126 calories.
4. Diego adds 3 teaspoons of sugar to each bottle.
   - Since he drinks 3 bottles, the total number of teaspoons of sugar he adds is 3 * 3 = 9 teaspoons.
5. Each teaspoon of sugar adds 6 calories.
   - So, the total calories from the sugar is 9 teaspoons * 6 calories/teaspoon = 54 calories.

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,A carpenter works for 2 weeks every month and 6 days every week. He gets paid ¥12 every day. How much does he earn in a year after paying 25% in taxes?,1296.0,"To calculate the carpenter's earnings in a year after paying 25% in taxes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of working days in a month:**
   The carpenter works for 2 weeks every month, and he works 6 days a week.
   \[
   \text{Working days per month} = 2 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 12 \text{ days}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of working days in a year:**
   There are 12 months in a year, so:
   \[
   \text{Working days per year} = 12 \text{ days/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 144 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total earnings before tax:**
   The carpenter earns ¥12 every day, so:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings before tax} = 144 \text{ days} \times ¥12/\text{day} = ¥1728
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount paid in taxes:**
   The carpenter pays 25% in taxes, so:
   \[
   \text{Taxes} = 25\% \text{ of } ¥1728 = 0.25 \times ¥1728 = ¥432
   \]

5. **Calculate the total earnings after tax:**
   Subtract the taxes from the total earnings:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings after tax} = ¥1728 - ¥432 = ¥1296
   \]

Thus, the carpenter earns **¥1296** in a year after paying 25% in taxes.",25.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The carpenter works for 2 weeks every month.
2. In each week, he works for 6 days.

Theo then bought 63 more kiwis at the store and 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis. He later bought 13 pineapples and 22 fewer than two times as many kiwis. How many pineapples and kiwis does Theo have in the house combined?",349.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Count of Kiwis**:
   Theo has 25 kiwis.

2. **Count of Pineapples**:
   According to the problem, there are eight times as many pineapples as kiwis. Therefore, the number of pineapples is:
   \[
   \text{Pineapples} = 8 \times \text{Kiwis} = 8 \times 25 = 200
   \]

3. **Kiwis After Purchase**:
   Theo bought 63 more kiwis. So, the new total of kiwis is:
   \[
   \text{New Kiwis} = 25 + 63 = 88
   \]

4. **Pineapples After Purchase**:
   Theo bought 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis he now has. Therefore, the number of pineapples he bought is:
   \[
   \text{Pineapples Bought} = \text{New Kiwis} - 19 = 88 - 19 = 69
   \]
   Now, we add this to the original number of pineapples:
   \[
   \text{Total Pineapples} = 200 + 69 = 269
   \]

5. **Pineapples and Kiwis After Further Purchases**:
   Theo then bought 13 more pineapples. So, the total number of pineapples now is:
   \[
   \text{Total Pineapples} = 269 + 13 = 282
   \]

   Next, he bought 22 fewer than two times as many kiwis. First, we calculate two times the number of kiwis:
   \[
   2 \times \text{New Kiwis} = 2 \times 88 = 176
   \]
   Now, subtracting 22 gives:
   \[
   \text{Kiwis Bought} = 176 - 22 = 154

   Adding this to the current number of kiwis:
   \[
   \text{Total Kiwis} = 88 + 154 = 242

She also bought a mixed bag of starfish for $11.0 and 17 keychains that were $20.0 each. Ananya then donated $5 at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Ananya have left?",361.0,"To find out how much money Ananya has left after her purchases, we will calculate the total cost of each item she bought and then subtract that from the initial amount of money she had.

1. **Cost of Saltwater Taffy:**
   - Ananya bought 23 kgs of saltwater taffy.
   - The offer is ""Buy 16 kgs at $23 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/2 off.""
   - First, calculate the cost for the first 16 kgs:
     \[
     16 \text{ kgs} \times 23 \text{ dollars/kg} = 368 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Now, for the next 4 kgs, since they are half off:
     \[
     4 \text{ kgs} \times \left(\frac{23}{2}\right) \text{ dollars/kg} = 4 \text{ kgs} \times 11.5 \text{ dollars/kg} = 46 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total cost for 20 kgs (16 kgs + 4 kgs):
     \[
     368 \text{ dollars} + 46 \text{ dollars} = 414 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Ananya has 3 kgs left to account for. Since there is no special offer for these, they will be at the regular price:
     \[
     3 \text{ kgs} \times 23 \text{ dollars/kg} = 69 \text{ dollars}

   - Total cost for all 23 kgs:
     \[
     414 \text{ dollars} + 69 \text{ dollars} = 483 \text{ dollars}

2. **Cost of the Mixed Bag of Starfish:**
   - The cost is $11.0.

3. **Cost of Keychains:**
   - Ananya bought 17 keychains at $20.0 each:
     \[
     17 \text{ keychains} \times 20 \text{ dollars/keychain} = 340 \text{ dollars}

5. **Donation:**
   - Ananya donated $5 at a charity stand.

6. **Final Calculation of Money Left:**

Thus, Ananya has **$361** left.",361.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Ananya starts with $1200.
2. She buys 23 kgs of saltwater taffy. The price is structured as follows:
   - For the first 16 kgs, the cost is 16 kgs * $23/kg = $368.
   - For the next 4 kgs, she gets them at half price. The price for 4 kgs at half price is:
     - Regular price for 4 kgs = 4 kgs * $23/kg = $92.
     - Half price = $92 / 2 = $46.
   - For the remaining 3 kgs, the cost is 3 kgs * $23/kg = $69.
   - So, the total cost for the taffy is $368 + $46 + $69 = $483.

3. Next, Ananya buys a mixed bag of starfish for $11.0.
4. Then, she buys 17 keychains at $20.0 each. The total cost for the keychains is:
   - 17 keychains * $20.0/keychain = $340.

5. Now, let's calculate the total amount spent:
   - Total spent = Cost of taffy + Cost of starfish + Cost of keychains
   - Total spent = $483 + $11 + $340 = $834.

6. Ananya also donates $5 at a charity stand. So, we need to add this to her total spending:

If the length of his room is 16 feet longer that its width, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?",68.0,"To find the perimeter of Kai's rectangular office, we first need to determine the dimensions of the room: its width and length.

Let the width of the room be \( w \) feet. According to the problem, the length \( l \) of the room is 16 feet longer than the width. Therefore, we can express the length as:

\[
l = w + 16
\]

The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[
A = l \times w
\]

We know the area of the office is 225 square feet, so we can set up the equation:

\[
w \times (w + 16) = 225
\]

Expanding this equation gives:

\[
w^2 + 16w = 225
\]

To solve for \( w \), we rearrange the equation:

\[
w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0
\]

Now, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for \( w \). The quadratic formula is:

\[
w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

In our equation, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 16 \), and \( c = -225 \). Plugging in these values:

\[
w = \frac{-16 \pm \sqrt{16^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-225)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]

Calculating the discriminant:

\[
16^2 = 256
\]
\[
-4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-225) = 900
\]
\[
b^2 - 4ac = 256 + 900 = 1156
\]

Now, taking the square root:

\[
\sqrt{1156} = 34
\]

Now substituting back into the quadratic formula:

\[
w = \frac{-16 \pm 34}{2}
\]

Calculating the two possible values for \( w \):

1. \( w = \frac{-16 + 34}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
2. \( w = \frac{-16 - 34}{2} = \frac{-50}{2} = -25 \) (not a valid solution since width cannot be negative)

Thus, the width \( w \) is 9 feet. Now we can find the length:

\[
l = w + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25 \text{ feet}
\]

Now that we have both dimensions, we can calculate the perimeter \( P \) of the rectangle using the formula:

\[
P = 2(l + w)
\]

Substituting the values of \( l \) and \( w \):

\[
P = 2(25 + 9) = 2(34) = 68 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, the perimeter of Kai's office is:

\[
\boxed{68} \text{ feet}
\]",68.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Let the width of the room be \( w \) feet.
2. According to the problem, the length of the room is \( w + 16 \) feet.
3. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
   \[
   \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
   \]
   So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   w \times (w + 16) = 225
   \]
4. Expanding this equation gives:
   \[
   w^2 + 16w = 225
   \]
5. Rearranging the equation to set it to zero:
   \[
   w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0
   \]
6. Now, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for \( w \):
   \[
   w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 16 \), and \( c = -225 \).
7. Calculating the discriminant:
   \[
   b^2 - 4ac = 16^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-225) = 256 + 900 = 1156
   \]
8. Now, substituting back into the quadratic formula:
   \[
   w = \frac{-16 \pm \sqrt{1156}}{2 \times 1}
   \]
   \[
   w = \frac{-16 \pm 34}{2}
   \]
9. This gives us two possible solutions for \( w \):
   \[
   w = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \quad \text{(valid, since width must be positive)}
   \]
   \[
   w = \frac{-50}{2} = -25 \quad \text{(not valid)}
   \]
10. So, the width \( w \) is 9 feet.
11. Now, we can find the length:
    \[
    \text{Length} = w + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25 \text{ feet}

12. Now, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:
    \[
    \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) = 2 \times (25 + 9) = 2 \times 34 = 68 \text{ feet}

On average, how many cards per color are there?",54.0,"To find the average number of cards per color, we first need to determine the number of red and purple cards based on the information given.

1. **Calculate the number of red cards:**
   - We know there are 30 pink cards.
   - The number of red cards is 70% more than the number of pink cards.
   - To find 70% of the number of pink cards:
     \[
     70\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.7 \times 30 = 21

   - Therefore, the number of red cards is:
     \[
     \text{Number of red cards} = 30 + 21 = 51
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of purple cards:**
   - The number of purple cards is equal to the sum of the pink and red cards.
   - The sum of pink and red cards is:
     \[
     30 + 51 = 81
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of purple cards is:
     \[
     \text{Number of purple cards} = 81
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of cards:**
   - Now we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of pink, red, and purple cards:
     \[
     \text{Total number of cards} = 30 + 51 + 81 = 162
     \]

4. **Calculate the average number of cards per color:**
   - There are 3 colors of cards (pink, red, and purple).
   - The average number of cards per color is:
     \[
     \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total number of cards}}{\text{Number of colors}} = \frac{162}{3} = 54

Thus, the average number of cards per color is \( \boxed{54} \).",54.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. We start with 30 pink cards.
2. We need to find out how many red cards there are. The problem states there are 70% more red cards than pink cards. 
   - To find 70% of the pink cards: 
     \( 70\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.7 \times 30 = 21 \).
   - Therefore, the number of red cards is:
     \( 30 + 21 = 51 \) red cards.
3. Now, we need to find the number of purple cards. The problem states that the number of purple cards is equal to the sum of pink and red cards.
   - The total number of pink and red cards is:
     \( 30 + 51 = 81 \).
   - So, there are 81 purple cards.
4. Now we have the total number of cards:
   - Pink cards: 30
   - Red cards: 51
   - Purple cards: 81
   - Total cards = \( 30 + 51 + 81 = 162 \).
5. To find the average number of cards per color, we divide the total number of cards by the number of colors (which is 3: pink, red, and purple):
   - Average = \( \frac{162}{3} = 54 \).

   Now we need to find out how many crackers he cannot place in the bowls and plates. He has 410 crackers, but the total capacity of the bowls and plates is 399 crackers. Therefore, the number of crackers that cannot be placed is:
   \[
   \text{Crackers that cannot be placed} = 410 - 399 = 11 \text{ crackers}
   \]

Thus, the number of crackers that Deshawn won't be able to place on the bowls or plates is \(\boxed{11}\).",11.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the capacity of the plates**: Each bowl can hold 21 crackers. Since each plate can hold two times that, the capacity of each plate is:
   \[
   2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ crackers}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and plates**:
   - Deshawn has 11 bowls, so the total capacity of the bowls is:
   \[
   11 \times 21 = 231 \text{ crackers}
   \]
   - Deshawn has 4 plates, so the total capacity of the plates is:
   \[
   4 \times 42 = 168 \text{ crackers}

3. **Calculate the total capacity of both bowls and plates**:
   \[
   231 + 168 = 399 \text{ crackers}

4. **Determine how many crackers Deshawn eats**: Deshawn has 615 crackers and eats a third of them. The number of crackers he eats is:
   \[
   \frac{615}{3} = 205 \text{ crackers}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of crackers left after eating**:
   \[
   615 - 205 = 410 \text{ crackers}

She writes it in full five times, writes three-sixths of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. After some rest, again she re-writes everything she has written so far. How many letters has Kayla written in total?",572.0,"To find out how many letters Kayla has written in total, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Writing the alphabet five times:**
   The English alphabet has 26 letters. If Kayla writes the alphabet in full five times, the total number of letters written in this step is:
   \[
   5 \times 26 = 130
   \]

2. **Writing three-sixths of the alphabet once:**
   Three-sixths of the alphabet is equivalent to half of the alphabet. Therefore, the number of letters in three-sixths of the alphabet is:

1. **Cold Water Swimming Time:**
   - Carlos swims 1 kilometer in 11 minutes.
   - Therefore, for 9 kilometers in cold water:
     \[
     \text{Time for 9 km in cold water} = 9 \text{ km} \times 11 \text{ minutes/km} = 99 \text{ minutes}

2. **Warm Water Swimming Time:**
   - Carlos swims 1 kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times the time it takes in cold water.
   - The time taken in cold water for 1 kilometer is 11 minutes, so:
     \[
     \text{Time for 1 km in warm water} = 4 \times 11 \text{ minutes} + 9 \text{ minutes} = 44 \text{ minutes} + 9 \text{ minutes} = 53 \text{ minutes}

     \[
     \text{Total flour needed} = 3 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ kg}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the flour:**
   - The total cost for 21 kilograms of the more expensive flour is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of flour} = 21 \text{ kg} \times ₣14/\text{kg} = ₣294
     \]

4. **Add the cost of the bagel:**
   - The cost of the bagel is ₣4.
   - Therefore, the total cost before any discounts is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost before discount} = ₣294 + ₣4 = ₣298
     \]

5. **Apply the discount:**
   - Santiago receives a discount of ₣23 because his total shopping was more than ₣50.
   - The total cost after the discount is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost after discount} = ₣298 - ₣23 = ₣275
     \]

Thus, the final amount Santiago has to pay is **₣275**.",275.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Santiago uses 3 kilograms of flour per day.
2. He needs flour for a week, which is 7 days.
3. So, the total amount of flour he needs is 3 kg/day * 7 days = 21 kg.

4. The normal brand of flour costs ₣10 per kilogram.
5. The more expensive brand costs 40% more than the normal brand.
6. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we calculate 40% of ₣10:
   - 40% of ₣10 = 0.40 * 10 = ₣4.
7. Therefore, the cost of the more expensive brand is:
   - ₣10 + ₣4 = ₣14 per kilogram.

8. Now, we calculate the total cost for 21 kg of the more expensive flour:
   - Total cost = 21 kg * ₣14/kg = ₣294.

9. Santiago also buys a bagel for ₣4.
10. So, the total cost including the bagel is:
    - Total cost = ₣294 + ₣4 = ₣298.

11. Since Santiago shopped more than ₣50, he receives a discount of ₣23.
12. We subtract the discount from the total cost:
    - Final amount to pay = ₣298 - ₣23 = ₣275.

- \( B = 34 \) (students who like to bake)
- \( H = 6 \) (students who like to play hurling)
- The total number of students is \( 160 \).
- The number of students who like to read is given by the equation \( R = 4H - 3 \).

5. **Calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks**:
   There are 35 patients admitted each day. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted is:
   \[
   \text{Total patients admitted} = 35 \times 14 = 490 \text{ patients}
   \]

6. **Calculate the new number of occupied beds after 2 weeks**:
   After 2 weeks, the number of occupied beds will increase by the number of patients admitted.
   \[
   \text{New occupied beds} = \text{Initial occupied beds} + \text{Total patients admitted} = 100 + 490 = 590 \text{ beds}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks**:
   Now we need to find the new number of unoccupied beds after accounting for the new admissions.
   \[
   \text{Total unoccupied",2.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The hospital has a total capacity of 800 beds.
2. First, we need to find out how many beds are occupied. Since 1/8 of the beds are occupied:
   \[
   \text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{8} \times 800 = 100 \text{ beds}
   \]

3. Next, we find out how many beds are out of service. One-fifth of all the beds are out of service:
   \[
   \text{Out of service beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 800 = 160 \text{ beds}
   \]

4. Now, we can calculate the total number of beds that are either occupied or out of service:
   \[
   \text{Total occupied and out of service beds} = 100 + 160 = 260 \text{ beds}
   \]

5. To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total occupied and out of service beds from the total capacity:
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied beds} = 800 - 260 = 540 \text{ beds}
   \]

6. Now, we need to account for the 35 patients admitted each day for 2 weeks (14 days):
   \[
   \text{Total patients admitted} = 35 \times 14 = 490 \text{ patients}
   \]

7. Finally, we subtract the total patients admitted from the unoccupied beds to find the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 540 - 490 = 50 \text{ beds}
   \]

On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday and 28 boxes of orange pie. On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the cupcake cost ₺10 and the orange pie cost ₺22, how much was Andre's average daily earning?",980.0,"To find Andre's average daily earning, we first need to determine how many boxes of cupcakes and orange pies he sold each day.

### Step 1: Determine the sales for Monday
- **Cupcakes sold on Monday**: 24 boxes
- **Orange pies sold on Monday**: Since he sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pies than on Tuesday, we need to find out how many he sold on Tuesday first.

### Step 2: Determine the sales for Tuesday
- **Cupcakes sold on Tuesday**: He sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday.
  \[
  \text{Cupcakes on Tuesday} = 24 + 11 = 35 \text{ boxes}
  \]
- **Orange pies sold on Tuesday**: He sold 28 boxes of orange pies.

### Step 3: Determine the sales for Monday's orange pies
Since he sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pies on Monday than on Tuesday:
\[
\text{Orange pies on Monday} = 28 - 16 = 12 \text{ boxes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the sales for Wednesday
On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. We need to calculate the total sales from Monday and Tuesday.

- **Total sales on Monday**:
  \[
  \text{Total on Monday} = \text{Cupcakes} + \text{Orange pies} = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ boxes}
  \]

- **Total sales on Tuesday**:
  \[
  \text{Total on Tuesday} = \text{Cupcakes} + \text{Orange pies} = 35 + 28 = 63 \text{ boxes}
  \]

- **Total sales for Monday and Tuesday combined**:
  \[
  \text{Total for both days} = 36 + 63 = 99 \text{ boxes}
  \]

Thus, on Wednesday, he sold 99 boxes.

### Step 5: Calculate the earnings for each day
Now we calculate the earnings for each day based on the prices of cupcakes and orange pies.

- **Earnings on Monday**:
  \[
  \text{Earnings from cupcakes} = 24 \times 10 = ₺240
  \]
  \[
  \text{Earnings from orange pies} = 12 \times 22 = ₺264
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total earnings on Monday} = 240 + 264 = ₺504
  \]

- **Earnings on Tuesday**:
  \[
  \text{Earnings from cupcakes} = 35 \times 10 = ₺350
  \]
  \[
  \text{Earnings from orange pies} = 28 \times 22 = ₺616
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total earnings on Tuesday} = 350 + 616 = ₺966
  \]

- **Earnings on Wednesday**:
  \[
  \text{Earnings from cupcakes} = 99 \times 10 = ₺990
  \]
  \[
  \text{Earnings from orange pies} = 0 \text{ (since we don't have the breakdown for Wednesday)}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total earnings on Wednesday} = 990 \text{ (assuming all were cupcakes)}
  \]

### Step 6: Calculate total earnings and average daily earnings
Now we sum the total earnings for the three days:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 504 + 966 + 990 = ₺2460
\]

To find the average daily earning:
\[
\text{Average daily earning} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{3} = \frac{2460}{3} = ₺820
\]

### Final Answer
Andre's average daily earning is **₺820**.",820.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Sales on Monday:**
   - Andre sold 24 boxes of cupcakes.
   - He sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pies than on Tuesday. 

2. **Sales on Tuesday:**
   - On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday:
     - So, he sold \( 24 + 11 = 35 \) boxes of cupcakes.
   - He sold 28 boxes of orange pies on Tuesday.

3. **Sales on Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined.
   - First, we need to calculate the total sales from Monday and Tuesday:
     - Total boxes sold on Monday = 24 (cupcakes) + (28 - 16) (orange pies) = 24 + 12 = 36 boxes.
     - Total boxes sold on Tuesday = 35 (cupcakes) + 28 (orange pies) = 63 boxes.
     - Combined total for Monday and Tuesday = 36 + 63 = 99 boxes.
   - Therefore, on Wednesday, he sold 99 boxes.

4. **Calculating Earnings:**
   - Now, we need to calculate the earnings for each day.
   - **Earnings on Monday:**
     - Cupcake earnings = \( 24 \times 10 = ₺240 \)
     - Orange pie earnings = \( 12 \times 22 = ₺264 \)
     - Total earnings on Monday = \( 240 + 264 = ₺504 \)

   - **Earnings on Tuesday:**
     - Cupcake earnings = \( 35 \times 10 = ₺350 \)
     - Orange pie earnings = \( 28 \times 22 = ₺616 \)
     - Total earnings on Tuesday = \( 350 + 616 = ₺966 \)

   - **Earnings on Wednesday:**
     - Total earnings on Wednesday = \( 99 \times 10 + 99 \times 22 \)
     - Earnings from cupcakes = \( 99 \times 10 = ₺990 \)
     - Earnings from orange pies = \( 99 \times 22 = ₺2178 \)
     - Total earnings on Wednesday = \( 990 + 2178 = ₺3168 \)

5. **Total Earnings Over Three Days:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings on Monday + Earnings on Tuesday + Earnings on Wednesday
   - Total earnings = \( 504 + 966 + 3168 = ₺4638 \)

6. **Average Daily Earnings:**
   - Average daily earnings = Total earnings / 3
   - Average daily earnings = \( 4638 / 3 = ₺1546 \)

The answer is ₺1546.",1546.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Sales on Monday:**
   - Andre sold 24 boxes of cupcakes.
   - He sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pies than on Tuesday. 

2. **Sales on Tuesday:**
   - On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday. 
   - So, the number of boxes of cupcakes sold on Tuesday is:
     \[
     24 + 11 = 35
     \]
   - He sold 28 boxes of orange pies on Tuesday.

3. **Sales on Monday for Orange Pies:**
   - Since he sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pies on Monday than on Tuesday, the number of boxes of orange pies sold on Monday is:
     \[
     28 - 16 = 12
     \]

4. **Sales on Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined.
   - The total sales for Monday (cupcakes + orange pies) is:
     \[
     24 + 12 = 36
     \]
   - The total sales for Tuesday (cupcakes + orange pies) is:
     \[
     35 + 28 = 63
     \]
   - Therefore, the total sales for both days combined is:
     \[
     36 + 63 = 99
     \]
   - So, on Wednesday, he sold 99 boxes.

5. **Calculating Total Earnings:**
   - The earnings from cupcakes:
     - Total boxes of cupcakes sold = \(24 + 35 + 99 = 158\)
     - Earnings from cupcakes = \(158 \times 10 = 1580\)
   - The earnings from orange pies:
     - Total boxes of orange pies sold = \(12 + 28 + 99 = 139\)
     - Earnings from orange pies = \(139 \times 22 = 3058\)

6. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from cupcakes + Earnings from orange pies:
     \[
     1580 + 3058 = 4638
     \]

7. **Average Daily Earnings:**
   - There are 3 days of sales (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday).
   - Average daily earnings = Total earnings / Number of days:
     \[
     4638 / 3 = 1546

How much older is Liam's uncle than Liam?,22.0,"Let \( u \) be the age of Liam's uncle when he first saw Comet Halley. According to the problem, we know that:

1. \( u = 31 \) (Liam's uncle was 31 years old when he first saw the comet).
2. The comet orbits the Sun every 53 years, so it will be seen again 53 years later.

Now, we can calculate Liam's uncle's age when he saw the comet for the second time:

   \]
   \[
   176 + 570 = 746
   \]
   \[
   746 + 373 = 1119

How many puzzle pieces did Uma place during that hour?",127.0,"To find out how many puzzle pieces Uma placed during that hour, we need to calculate the number of pieces she completed from each puzzle.

1. **Calculating pieces from the first puzzle:**
   - Uma finished one-fifth of a 420 piece puzzle.
   - To find one-fifth of 420, we calculate:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} \times 420 = \frac{420}{5} = 84
     \]
   - So, Uma placed 84 pieces from the first puzzle.

2. **Calculating pieces from the second puzzle:**
   - Uma finished one-tenth of a 430 piece puzzle.
   - To find one-tenth of 430, we calculate:
     \[
     \frac{1}{10} \times 430 = \frac{430}{10} = 43

They agree to split it with Tara getting 190 yards more than Ananya, and Umar getting 30 yards more than Tara. How much is left over for Ananya?",150.0,"Let's denote the amount of fence Ananya gets as \( A \) yards. According to the problem, Tara gets 190 yards more than Ananya, so we can express Tara's amount as:

\[
T = A + 190
\]

Umar gets 30 yards more than Tara, so we can express Umar's amount as:

\[
U = T + 30 = (A + 190) + 30 = A + 220
\]

Now, we can set up an equation for the total amount of fence:

\[
A + T + U = 860
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( T \) and \( U \) into the equation gives us:

\[
A + (A + 190) + (A + 220) = 860
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
A + A + 190 + A + 220 = 860
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3A + 410 = 860
\]

Next, we will isolate \( A \) by subtracting 410 from both sides:

\[
3A = 860 - 410
\]
\[
3A = 450
\]

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( A \):

\[
A = \frac{450}{3} = 150
\]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find the amounts for Tara and Umar:

\[
T = A + 190 = 150 + 190 = 340
\]
\[
U = T + 30 = 340 + 30 = 370
\]

Finally, we can check the total:

\[
A + T + U = 150 + 340 + 370 = 860

This confirms our calculations are correct. 

Thus, the amount of fence left over for Ananya is:

\[
\boxed{150} \text{ yards}
\]",150.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Let the amount of fence Ananya gets be represented as \( A \).
2. According to the problem, Tara gets 190 yards more than Ananya, so Tara's amount can be represented as \( A + 190 \).
3. Umar gets 30 yards more than Tara, so Umar's amount can be represented as \( (A + 190) + 30 = A + 220 \).
4. Now we can express the total amount of fence in terms of \( A \):
   \[
   A + (A + 190) + (A + 220) = 860

5. Simplifying this equation:
   \[
   A + A + 190 + A + 220 = 860

   \[
   3A = 860 - 410

On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?",75.0,"Let \( v \) be Olivia's original speed on the beach in kilometers per hour. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is \( 4v \).

Since Olivia's speed has decreased by half due to her injury, her new speed on the beach is \( \frac{v}{2} \) and her new speed on the sidewalk is \( \frac{4v}{2} = 2v \).

We know that Olivia spends 60 minutes (or 1 hour) walking on the beach. The distance she walks on the beach is 10 kilometers. We can use the formula for time, which is:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

For the beach:

\[
1 \text{ hour} = \frac{10 \text{ km}}{\frac{v}{2}}

This simplifies to:

\[
1 = \frac{10 \cdot 2}{v}

Thus, we have:

\[
v = 20 \text{ km/h}
\]

Now, we can find Olivia's new speed on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2v = 2 \cdot 20 = 40 \text{ km/h}

3. Due to her recent injury, her speed has decreased by half. So, her new speed on the beach is \( \frac{v}{2} \) and her new speed on the sidewalk is \( \frac{4v}{2} = 2v \).

4. We are told that 60 minutes (1 hour) of her walk is spent on the beach. Since she walks 10 kilometers on the beach, we can find her speed on the beach:
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - 10 km = \( \frac{v}{2} \) × 1 hour
   - To convert 1 hour to minutes, we use 60 minutes, so:
   - 10 km = \( \frac{v}{2} \) × 60 minutes
   - Rearranging gives us \( v = \frac{10 \times 2}{60} = \frac{20}{60} = \frac{1}{3} \) km/min.

5. Now, we can calculate her speed on the sidewalk:
   - Speed on the sidewalk = \( 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \) km/min.

7. **Eggs found by Oscar:**
   \[
   \text{Oscar finds} = \text{Tara and James combined} + 4 \text{ dozen} = 24 + 4 \times 12 = 24 + 48 = 72 \text{ eggs}

Thus, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(\boxed{12}\).",12.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Esteban hid 11 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we calculate the total number of eggs:
   \[
   11 \text{ dozen} = 11 \times 12 = 132 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. James finds 4 eggs.

3. Tara finds five times as many eggs as James:
   \[
   \text{Tara's eggs} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ eggs}

4. Winnie finds 4 less than Tara:
   \[
   \text{Winnie's eggs} = 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ eggs}
   \]

5. Noah finds half as many as Winnie:
   \[
   \text{Noah's eggs} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ eggs}
   \]

6. Oscar finds four dozen eggs more than Tara and James combined. First, we calculate how many eggs Tara and James found together:
   \[
   \text{Tara's eggs} + \text{James's eggs} = 20 + 4 = 24 \text{ eggs}
   \]
   Now, we calculate four dozen eggs:
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs}

   So, Oscar finds:
   \[
   \text{Oscar's eggs} = 24 + 48 = 72 \text{ eggs}

   \[
   = 4 + 20 + 16 + 8 + 72 = 120 \text{ eggs}

   - The third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh trouts each weigh 16 kg more than the second trout.

   The weight of the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh trouts can be calculated as follows:
   - Weight of the third trout: \( 31 + 16 = 47 \) kg
   - Weight of the fourth trout: \( 31 + 16 = 47 \) kg
   - Weight of the fifth trout: \( 31 + 16 = 47 \) kg

   \[
   6 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 12 \text{ minutes per floor}

3. **Convert the total cleaning time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

3. To find out how long it will take to clean all 180 floors, we multiply the number of floors by the time taken per floor: 
   180 floors * 12 minutes per floor = 2160 minutes.
4. The maintenance worker works for 6 hours a day. We need to convert this into minutes: 
   6 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 360 minutes.
5. Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to clean all the floors. Since they have 10 days to complete the task, we can check if they can finish in that time:
   Total time needed = 2160 minutes.
   Time available in 10 days = 10 days * 360 minutes per day = 3600 minutes.
6. Since 2160 minutes is less than 3600 minutes, they can complete the task within the 10 days.
7. Now, we need to find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning floors. We take the total time spent cleaning floors in one day and divide it by the total time they work in a day:
   Time spent cleaning per day = Total time needed / Number of days = 2160 minutes / 10 days = 216 minutes per day.
8. Now, we calculate the percentage of their workday spent cleaning:

   - Number of pops = 3 times the first amount = \(3 \times 90 = 270\)

3. **Next 22 seconds:**
   - Number of pops = 4 times the initial amount = \(4 \times 90 = 360\)

4. **Final 22 seconds:**
   - Number of pops = half the rate of the previous 22 seconds = \(\frac{360}{2} = 180\)

Now, let's calculate the total number of pops during the cooking time:

\[
\text{Total pops} = 90 + 270 + 360 + 180
\]

Calculating this step by step:

\[
90 + 270 = 360
\]
\[
360 + 360 = 720
\]
\[
720 + 180 = 900
\]

So, the total number of pops during cooking is **900**.

5. **Pops from residual heat:**
   - A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds:
   \[
   \text{Pops from residual heat} = \frac{1}{4} \times 180 = 45
   \]

6. **Total popcorn:**
   - Total popcorn = Total pops + Pops from residual heat
   \[
   \text{Total popcorn} = 900 + 45 = 945
   \]

7. **Popcorn given to Tariq:**
   - Alejandro gives \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the total popcorn to Tariq:
   \[
   \text{Popcorn given to Tariq} = \frac{1}{5} \times 945 = 189
   \]

8. **Popcorn Alejandro has to eat:**
   - Total popcorn - Popcorn given to Tariq:
   \[
   \text{Popcorn Alejandro eats} = 945 - 189 = 756
   \]

Thus, the number of pieces of popcorn that Alejandro has to eat is **756**.",756.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. In the first 22 seconds, 90 kernels pop.
2. In the next 22 seconds, the amount that pops is 3 times the first amount:
   - 3 * 90 = 270 kernels.
3. In the following 22 seconds, the popping rate increases to 4 times the initial rate:
   - 4 * 90 = 360 kernels.
4. In the final 22 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate of the previous 22 seconds:
   - Half of 360 = 180 kernels.
5. Now, let's calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the cooking:
   - Total = 90 + 270 + 360 + 180 = 900 kernels.
6. After cooking, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds also pop from the residual heat:
   - A quarter of 180 = 180 / 4 = 45 kernels.
7. Now, we add the kernels that popped from the residual heat to the total:
   - Total kernels = 900 + 45 = 945 kernels.
8. Alejandro gives 1/5 of the total popcorn to his brother Tariq:
   - Amount given to Tariq = 1/5 * 945 = 189 kernels.
9. Finally, to find out how many pieces of popcorn Alejandro has to eat, we subtract the amount given to Tariq from the total:
   - Popcorn left for Alejandro = 945 - 189 = 756 kernels.

The answer is 756.",756.0,1,,756.0,1

If there are 40 cubes in the pyramid in total, what percentage of cubes are white?",40.0,"To find the percentage of white cubes in the pyramid, we first need to determine the total number of each type of cube.

1. **Identify the number of green cubes**: 
   - There are 4 green cubes.

2. **Identify the number of black cubes**: 
   - The number of black cubes is five times the number of green cubes. 
   - Therefore, the number of black cubes is:
     \[
     5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ black cubes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of green and black cubes**:
   - Total cubes from green and black:
     \[
     4 \text{ (green)} + 20 \text{ (black)} = 24 \text{ cubes}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of white cubes**:
   - The total number of cubes in the pyramid is 40. 
   - Let \( w \) be the number of white cubes. We can set up the equation:
     \[
     4 + 20 + w = 40
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     24 + w = 40
     \]
   - Solving for \( w \):
     \[
     w = 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ white cubes}
     \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of white cubes**:
   - The percentage of white cubes is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage of white cubes} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of white cubes}}{\text{Total number of cubes}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values we found:
     \[
     \text{Percentage of white cubes} = \left( \frac{16}{40} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Calculating this gives:
     \[
     \frac{16}{40} = 0.4

If the force need to move the car is 2% of the total weight, how much force does Esteban need to push the car?",44.0,"To find the total weight of Esteban's car, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, the children, and the spare tires.

1. **Weight of the car**: 1350 pounds
2. **Weight of the luggage**: 450 pounds
3. **Weight of the children**: There are 4 children, each weighing 65 pounds. So, the total weight of the children is:
   \[
   4 \times 65 = 260 \text{ pounds}

If Oscar, who is younger than Arash but older than Ali, is 54 years old, what's the average of their ages?",57.0,"Let's denote the ages of Oscar, Arash, and Ali as follows:

- Oscar's age = \( O = 54 \) years
- Arash's age = \( A \)
- Ali's age = \( L \)

From the problem, we know the following:

1. Oscar is younger than Arash: \( O < A \)
2. Oscar is older than Ali: \( O > L \)
3. The age difference between Oscar and Arash is 27 years: 
   \[
   A - O = 27
