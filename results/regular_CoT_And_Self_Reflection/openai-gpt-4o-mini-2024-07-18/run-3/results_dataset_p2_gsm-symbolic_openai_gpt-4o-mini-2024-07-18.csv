gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Sophia went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, and 60 mini cheesecakes. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,"To find the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen, we can start by calculating the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes that Sophia bought.

1. **Calculate the cost of the donuts:**
   - Sophia bought 60 donuts.
   - Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, the number of dozens of donuts she bought is:
     \[
     \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ dozens}
     \]
   - The cost per dozen of donuts is $19, so the total cost for the donuts is:
     \[
     5 \text{ dozens} \times 19 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 95 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:**
   - Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes.
   - The number of dozens of mini cupcakes she bought is:
     \[
     \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ dozens}
     \]
   - The cost per dozen of mini cupcakes is $33, so the total cost for the mini cupcakes is:
     \[
     5 \text{ dozens} \times 33 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 165 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   - Let \( x \) be the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen.
   - The number of dozens of mini cheesecakes she bought is:
     \[
     \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ dozens}
     \]
   - The total cost for the mini cheesecakes is:
     \[
     5 \text{ dozens} \times x \text{ dollars/dozen} = 5x \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost before the discount is:
     \[
     95 + 165 + 5x = 260 + 5x \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**
   - Sophia received a 20% discount on her total cost. Therefore, she paid 80% of the total cost:
     \[
     0.8 \times (260 + 5x) = 1500
     \]

5. **Set up the equation and solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   0.8(260 + 5x) = 1500
   \]
   \[
   208 + 4x = 1500
   \]
   \[
   4x = 1500 - 208
   \]
   \[
   4x = 1292
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{1292}{4} = 323
   \]

Thus, the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is \(\boxed{323}\) dollars.",323.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the donuts:**
   - Sophia bought 60 donuts.
   - Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, she bought \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $19.
   - So, the total cost for the donuts is \( 5 \times 19 = 95 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:**
   - Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes.
   - She bought \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $33.
   - So, the total cost for the mini cupcakes is \( 5 \times 33 = 165 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   - Let \( x \) be the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen.
   - She bought 60 mini cheesecakes, which is \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozen.
   - So, the total cost for the mini cheesecakes is \( 5x \) dollars.
   - The total cost before the discount is \( 95 + 165 + 5x \).

4. **Apply the 20% discount:**
   - The total amount paid after the discount is $1500.
   - The total cost before the discount can be expressed as \( 0.8 \times (95 + 165 + 5x) = 1500 \).

5. **Set up the equation:**
   - \( 0.8 \times (260 + 5x) = 1500 \).
   - Dividing both sides by 0.8 gives:
   \[
   260 + 5x = \frac{1500}{0.8} = 1875.
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 260 from both sides:
   \[
   5x = 1875 - 260 = 1615.
   \]
   - Divide by 5:
   \[
   x = \frac{1615}{5} = 323.
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is $323.

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving. A 300 grams bag has 6 servings. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?",350.0,"To determine how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara, we first need to calculate their remaining calorie allowances based on their daily calorie targets and what they have already consumed.

### Step 1: Calculate Daily Calorie Target
Hiroshi's weight: 220 lbs  
Tara's weight: 140 lbs  

**Hiroshi's daily calorie target:**
\[
15 \text{ calories/lb} \times 220 \text{ lbs} = 3300 \text{ calories}
\]

**Tara's daily calorie target:**
\[
15 \text{ calories/lb} \times 140 \text{ lbs} = 2100 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Remaining Calories
**Hiroshi's total calories consumed:**
\[
1100 \text{ calories (food)} - 200 \text{ calories (burned)} = 900 \text{ net calories}
\]

**Hiroshi's remaining calories:**
\[
3300 \text{ calories (target)} - 900 \text{ net calories} = 2400 \text{ calories}
\]

**Tara's total calories consumed:**
\[
900 \text{ calories (food)} + 200 \text{ calories (ice cream)} = 1100 \text{ total calories}
\]

**Tara's remaining calories:**
\[
2100 \text{ calories (target)} - 1100 \text{ total calories} = 1000 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Popcorn Consumption
Each serving of popcorn has 200 calories, and there are 6 servings in a 300-gram bag, which means:
\[
\text{Total calories in the bag} = 200 \text{ calories/serving} \times 6 \text{ servings} = 1200 \text{ calories}
\]

**Calories per gram of popcorn:**
\[
\frac{1200 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} = 4 \text{ calories/gram}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Grams of Popcorn Needed
**Hiroshi's grams of popcorn needed:**
\[
\frac{2400 \text{ calories}}{4 \text{ calories/gram}} = 600 \text{ grams}
\]

**Tara's grams of popcorn needed:**
\[
\frac{1000 \text{ calories}}{4 \text{ calories/gram}} = 250 \text{ grams}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Difference
Now, we find out how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara:
\[
600 \text{ grams (Hiroshi)} - 250 \text{ grams (Tara)} = 350 \text{ grams}
\]

### Final Answer
Hiroshi needs to consume **350 more grams of popcorn** than Tara.",350.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate Hiroshi's daily calorie target:**
   - Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs.
   - The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight.
   - So, Hiroshi's daily calorie target is 220 lbs * 15 calories/lb = 3300 calories.

2. **Calculate Hiroshi's net calorie intake:**
   - Hiroshi has already consumed 1100 calories.
   - He has burned 200 calories through exercise.
   - So, his net calorie intake is 1100 - 200 = 900 calories.

3. **Calculate how many more calories Hiroshi can consume:**
   - Hiroshi's remaining calorie allowance is 3300 - 900 = 2400 calories.

4. **Calculate the calories in one serving of popcorn:**
   - A bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving.
   - The bag has 6 servings, so the total calories in the bag is 200 * 6 = 1200 calories.

5. **Calculate how many servings of popcorn Hiroshi can consume:**
   - To find out how many servings Hiroshi can consume with his remaining 2400 calories, we divide:
   - 2400 calories / 200 calories per serving = 12 servings.

6. **Calculate the total grams of popcorn Hiroshi can consume:**
   - Since the bag has 6 servings and weighs 300 grams, each serving weighs:
   - 300 grams / 6 servings = 50 grams per serving.
   - Therefore, for 12 servings, Hiroshi can consume:
   - 12 servings * 50 grams/serving = 600 grams of popcorn.

7. **Calculate Tara's daily calorie target:**
   - Tara weighs 140 lbs.
   - Her daily calorie target is 140 lbs * 15 calories/lb = 2100 calories.

8. **Calculate Tara's net calorie intake:**
   - Tara has consumed 900 calories in food and 200 calories in ice cream.
   - So, her total calorie intake is 900 + 200 = 1100 calories.

9. **Calculate how many more calories Tara can consume:**
   - Tara's remaining calorie allowance is 2100 - 1100 = 1000 calories.

10. **Calculate how many servings of popcorn Tara can consume:**
    - To find out how many servings Tara can consume with her remaining 1000 calories, we divide:
    - 1000 calories / 200 calories per serving = 5 servings.

11. **Calculate the total grams of popcorn Tara can consume:**
    - For 5 servings, Tara can consume:
    - 5 servings * 50 grams/serving = 250 grams of popcorn.

12. **Calculate how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara:**
    - Hiroshi can consume 600 grams, and Tara can consume 250 grams.
    - The difference is 600 grams - 250 grams = 350 grams.

The answer is 350 grams.",350.0,1,,350.0,1
gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Daphne is an avid gardener. Two days ago, she received 23 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges of her large country home. She also purchased 200 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Daphne remain with?",335.0,"To find out how many potted plants Daphne will have remaining, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of potted plants Daphne currently has:**
   - She received 23 new potted plants two days ago.
   - She already has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges.

   First, calculate the total number of potted plants on the window ledges:
   \[
   \text{Total plants on ledges} = 8 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 56 \text{ ledges} = 448 \text{ plants}
   \]

   Now, add the new plants she received:
   \[
   \text{Total plants after receiving new ones} = 448 \text{ plants} + 23 \text{ plants} = 471 \text{ plants}
   \]

2. **Add the new plants she purchased yesterday:**
   - She purchased 200 new plants at a 50% discount, but the discount does not affect the count of plants, only the price. Therefore, she adds these 200 plants to her total:
   \[
   \text{Total plants after purchase} = 471 \text{ plants} + 200 \text{ plants} = 671 \text{ plants}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of plants she will give away:**
   - She plans to give away 6 potted plants from each of the 56 ledges:
   \[
   \text{Total plants given away} = 6 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 56 \text{ ledges} = 336 \text{ plants}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining number of potted plants:**
   - Subtract the number of plants she gives away from her total:
   \[
   \text{Remaining plants} = 671 \text{ plants} - 336 \text{ plants} = 335 \text{ plants}
   \]

Thus, the total number of potted plants Daphne will have remaining is \( \boxed{335} \).",335.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Initial Plants**: Daphne received 23 new potted plants from the nursery.
2. **Existing Plants**: She already has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges.

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 60 minutes to cover every 4 miles of the city. However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city, we first need to understand the initial conditions and the effect of the wind speed change.

1. **City Size**: The city is 80 miles across.
2. **Distance to Cover 1/4 of the City**: 
   \[
   \text{1/4 of the city} = \frac{80 \text{ miles}}{4} = 20 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Fog Coverage Rate**: The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes. We can calculate the rate of coverage:
   \[
   \text{Rate} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{15 \text{ minutes}}
   \]

4. **Time to Cover 20 Miles at Initial Rate**:
   To find out how long it would take to cover 20 miles at the initial rate:
   \[
   \text{Time} = 20 \text{ miles} \times 15 \text{ minutes/mile} = 300 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Effect of Wind Speed Halving**: The problem states that the wind speed will be halved in one hour. This means that after 60 minutes, the fog will cover less distance in the same amount of time. 

   - Initially, in the first hour (60 minutes), the fog covers:
   \[
   4 \text{ miles}
   \]
   - After 60 minutes, the wind speed is halved, which means the fog will cover half the distance in the next hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance covered in the next hour} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles}
   \]

6. **Total Distance Covered After 2 Hours**:
   - In the first hour, it covers 4 miles.
   - In the second hour, it covers 2 miles.
   - Total distance covered in 2 hours:
   \[
   4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

7. **Remaining Distance to Cover**:
   After 2 hours, the fog has covered 6 miles, so the remaining distance to cover is:
   \[
   20 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 14 \text{ miles}
   \]

8. **Time to Cover Remaining Distance**:
   After 2 hours, the fog will continue to cover at the halved rate of 2 miles per hour (since it covers 2 miles in the next hour). To find out how long it will take to cover the remaining 14 miles:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{14 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 7 \text{ hours}
   \]

9. **Total Time to Cover 20 Miles**:
   The total time to cover 20 miles is:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} + 7 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

10. **Convert Total Time to Minutes**:
   \[
   9 \text{ hours} = 9 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 540 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, it will take **540 minutes** for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city.",4.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge.
2. We need to find out how long it takes for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city.
3. 1/4 of the city is 80 miles / 4 = 20 miles.
4. The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes.
5. To find out how long it takes to cover 1 mile, we can calculate: 
   - 60 minutes / 4 miles = 15 minutes per mile.
6. Now, we need to find out how long it takes to cover 20 miles:
   - 20 miles * 15 minutes per mile = 300 minutes.
7. However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. This means that after 60 minutes, the fog bank will cover less distance.
8. In the first hour (60 minutes), the fog bank covers 4 miles.
9. After 60 minutes, the wind speed is halved, so the fog bank will cover 2 miles in the next hour (60 minutes).
10. Therefore, in the first 60 minutes, the fog bank covers 4 miles, and in the next 60 minutes, it covers 2 miles, totaling 6 miles in 120 minutes.
11. To cover the remaining 14 miles (20 miles - 6 miles), we need to calculate how long it will take with the halved speed:
    - At the halved speed, it covers 2 miles in 60 minutes, so it covers 1 mile in 30 minutes.
12. To cover 14 miles at this speed:
    - 14 miles * 30 minutes per mile = 420 minutes.

13. Now, we add the time taken to cover the first 6 miles (120 minutes) to the time taken to cover the remaining 14 miles (420 minutes):
    - Total time = 120 minutes + 420 minutes = 540 minutes.

If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?",6.0,"To find out how many 15-minute episodes Santiago watched on Thursday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he spent watching TV from Tuesday to Sunday, excluding Thursday.

1. **Tuesday**: Watched 4 hours.
2. **Wednesday**: Watched 4 hours.
3. **Thursday**: Let \( x \) be the number of 15-minute episodes he watched.
4. **Friday**: Watched 3 hours and 45 minutes. We convert this to hours:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} + \frac{45}{60} \text{ hours} = 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 \text{ hours}

Now, we can sum the hours watched from Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:

- Tuesday: 4 hours
- Wednesday: 4 hours
- Friday: 3.75 hours
- Saturday: 6 hours
- Sunday: 0.75 hours

Calculating the total time for these days:

Next, we convert 1.5 hours into minutes:
\[
1.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \times 60 = 90 \text{ minutes}

1. **Calculate the total hours watched from Tuesday to Saturday:**
   - On Tuesday, Santiago watched 4 hours.
   - On Wednesday, he watched another 4 hours.
   - On Thursday, he watched some 15-minute episodes (we'll calculate this later).
   - On Friday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. 
     - 3 hours = 3 hours
     - 45 minutes = 0.75 hours
     - Total for Friday = 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.
   - On Saturday, he watched three 2-hour episodes.

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Nia makes tea using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 54:27. She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, and uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the ratios and the total amounts used by Nia.

1. **Understanding the Ratios**:
   - The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 54:27. This can be simplified:
     \[
     \frac{54}{27} = 2
     \]
   - This means for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, there are 1 cup of water.

2. **Milk and Cream Ratios**:
   - Nia uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, which simplifies to 1 tablespoon of milk per cup of water.
   - She uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar.

3. **Setting Up the Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of teaspoons of sugar used.
   - From the sugar to water ratio, the number of cups of water used will be \( \frac{x}{2} \).
   - The number of tablespoons of milk used will be equal to the number of cups of water, which is \( \frac{x}{2} \).
   - The number of tablespoons of heavy cream used will be \( 2x \) (since she uses 2 tablespoons of cream for every teaspoon of sugar).

4. **Total Amount Used**:
   - The total amount of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is given as 240. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x + \frac{x}{2} = 240
   \]

5. **Combining Like Terms**:
   - Combine the terms:
   \[
   x + 2x + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} = 240
   \]
   - This simplifies to:
   \[
   3x + x = 240
   \]
   - Which further simplifies to:
   \[
   4x = 240
   \]

6. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = \frac{240}{4} = 60

   - Sugar: 54 / 27 = 2
   - Water: 27 / 27 = 1
   So, the simplified ratio is 2:1. This means for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 1 cup of water.

3. Nia also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water. This means she uses 1 tablespoon of milk for every cup of water.

4. Additionally, she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar.

5. Now, we need to find out how many total parts are involved in her recipe. 
   - For sugar and water, we have 2 parts (sugar) + 1 part (water) = 3 parts.
   - For milk, since she uses 1 tablespoon of milk for every cup of water, we can say she uses 1 part of milk for every 1 part of water.
   - For cream, she uses 2 tablespoons of cream for every teaspoon of sugar, which means she uses 2 parts of cream for every 2 parts of sugar.

6. Now, let's summarize the parts:
   - Sugar: 2 parts
   - Water: 1 part
   - Milk: 1 part (since it corresponds to the 1 part of water)
   - Cream: 2 parts (since it corresponds to the 2 parts of sugar)

7. Adding these parts together gives us:
   - Total parts = 2 (sugar) + 1 (water) + 1 (milk) + 2 (cream) = 6 parts.

8. We know that the total amount used is 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. Since we have 6 parts, we can find the value of each part:
   - Each part = 240 / 6 = 40.

9. Now, we can find out how many teaspoons of sugar Nia used:
   - Since sugar corresponds to 2 parts, the amount of sugar used is 2 * 40 = 80 teaspoons.

The answer is 80.",80.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Nia uses sugar and water in a ratio of 54:27. This means for every 54 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 27 cups of water. We can simplify this ratio:
   - 54:27 simplifies to 2:1 (since 54 ÷ 27 = 2 and 27 ÷ 27 = 1).

2. Nia also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water. This means she uses 1 tablespoon of milk for every cup of water.

3. Additionally, she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar.

4. We know that the total amount of ingredients used (sugar, water, cream, and milk) is 240 teaspoons.

5. Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as \( S \), the number of cups of water as \( W \), the number of tablespoons of cream as \( C \), and the number of tablespoons of milk as \( M \).

6. From the ratios:
   - Since \( S \) (sugar) and \( W \) (water) are in a 2:1 ratio, we can express \( W \) in terms of \( S \):
     \[
     W = \frac{S}{2}
     \]

7. For the cream, since she uses 2 tablespoons of cream for every teaspoon of sugar:
   \[
   C = 2S
   \]

8. For the milk, since she uses 1 tablespoon of milk for every cup of water:
   \[
   M = W = \frac{S}{2}
   \]

9. Now we can express the total amount of ingredients in terms of \( S \):
   \[
   S + W + C + M = 240
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for \( W \), \( C \), and \( M \):
   \[
   S + \frac{S}{2} + 2S + \frac{S}{2} = 240
   \]

10. Combining like terms:
    \[
    S + \frac{S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} + 2S = 240
    \]
    \[
    4S = 240
    \]

11. Solving for \( S \):
    \[
    S = \frac{240}{4} = 60
    \]

The answer is 60 teaspoons of sugar.",60.0,1

She noticed that she was out of plastic forks, so she bought a new package of forks. Later, her husband also bought a package of 8 new forks and gave them to Aisha. While Aisha was making the stuffed peppers, she used sixteen of the forks to sample her stuffed peppers, then threw away 6 defective forks. The guests also brought 2 packs of forks, each having 6 inside them. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 32 forks. How many forks were in the package that Aisha bought?",34.0,"Let's denote the number of forks in the package that Aisha bought as \( x \).

1. Aisha bought \( x \) forks.
2. Her husband bought 8 forks.
3. Aisha used 16 forks to sample the stuffed peppers.
4. Aisha threw away 6 defective forks.
5. The guests brought 2 packs of forks, each containing 6 forks, which totals \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) forks.

Now, we can set up the equation to find the total number of forks Aisha had after all these transactions:

\[
\text{Total forks} = \text{Aisha's forks} + \text{Husband's forks} + \text{Guests' forks} - \text{Used forks} - \text{Defective forks}

4. **Total bananas in 10 square yards**:
   \[
   \text{Total bananas} = 10 \text{ square yards} \times 45 \text{ bananas per square yard} = 450 \text{ bananas}
   \]
5. **Harvest frequency**: Every 4 months means 3 times a year.
6. **Total harvests in 2 years**: 
   \[
   2 \text{ years} \times 3 \text{ harvests per year} = 6 \text{ harvests}
   \]
7. **Total bananas harvested in 2 years**:

### Conclusion

Ravi harvests **1764 more bananas** than apricots in the span of two years.",1764.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of square yards for the banana field:**
   Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field.

2. **Determine the number of bananas produced per square yard:**
   There are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard. To find out how many bananas are produced per square yard, we can set up a proportion:
   \[
   \text{Bananas per square yard} = \frac{36 \text{ bananas}}{\frac{4}{5} \text{ square yards}} = 36 \times \frac{5}{4} = 45 \text{ bananas per square yard}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of bananas harvested in 10 square yards:**
   \[
   \text{Total bananas} = 10 \text{ square yards} \times 45 \text{ bananas per square yard} = 450 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. **Determine the harvest frequency for bananas:**
   Ravi can harvest his bananas every 4 months. In 2 years, there are:
   \[
   2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months}
   \]
   The number of harvests in 2 years is:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ months}}{4 \text{ months/harvest}} = 6 \text{ harvests}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of bananas harvested in 2 years:**

Arjun can either pay a one-time $20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases, or not become a member and receive only a 5% discount. What is the least amount Arjun can spend on everything?",212.0,"To determine the least amount Arjun can spend, we will calculate the total cost of his purchases both with and without the membership discount.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost without membership

1. **Cost of folders**:
   \[
   12 \text{ folders} \times 4.75 \text{ dollars/folder} = 57.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of erasers**:
   \[
   8 \text{ erasers} \times 14.50 \text{ dollars/eraser} = 116.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of bond paper**:
   \[
   1 \text{ ream} \times 11.00 \text{ dollars/ream} = 11.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of pencils**:
   \[
   7 \text{ pencils} \times 8.00 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 56.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Total cost without membership**:
   \[
   57.00 + 116.00 + 11.00 + 56.00 = 240.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost with membership

1. **Cost of folders**:
   \[
   12 \text{ folders} \times 4.75 \text{ dollars/folder} = 57.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of erasers**:
   \[
   8 \text{ erasers} \times 14.50 \text{ dollars/eraser} = 116.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of bond paper**:
   \[

   \]

4. **Cost of pencils**:
   \[
   7 \text{ pencils} \times 8.00 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 56.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Total cost before discount with membership**:
   \[
   57.00 + 116.00 + 11.00 + 56.00 = 240.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Apply the 20% discount**:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 240.00 = 0.20 \times 240.00 = 48.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total after discount} = 240.00 - 48.00 = 192.00 \text{ dollars}

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost with the 5% discount (without membership)

1. **Apply the 5% discount**:
   \[
   5\% \text{ of } 240.00 = 0.05 \times 240.00 = 12.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total after discount} = 240.00 - 12.00 = 228.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 4: Compare the total costs

- Total cost without membership (5% discount): **$228.00**
- Total cost with membership (20% discount + membership fee): **$212.00**

### Conclusion

The least amount Arjun can spend is:
\[
\boxed{212.00} \text{ dollars}
\]",212.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost without any discounts:**
   - Cost of folders: 12 folders * $4.75 each = 12 * 4.75 = $57.00
   - Cost of erasers: 8 erasers * $14.50 each = 8 * 14.50 = $116.00
   - Cost of bond paper: 1 ream * $11.00 = $11.00
   - Cost of pencils: 7 pencils * $8.00 each = 7 * 8 = $56.00

   Now, let's add these costs together:
   - Total cost = $57.00 + $116.00 + $11.00 + $56.00 = $240.00

2. **Calculate the total cost with the membership discount (20% off):**
   - Membership fee = $20.00
   - Discount on total cost = 20% of $240.00 = 0.20 * 240 = $48.00
   - Total cost with membership = Total cost - Discount + Membership fee
   - Total cost with membership = $240.00 - $48.00 + $20.00 = $212.00

3. **Calculate the total cost without membership (5% off):**
   - Discount on total cost = 5% of $240.00 = 0.05 * 240 = $12.00
   - Total cost without membership = Total cost - Discount
   - Total cost without membership = $240.00 - $12.00 = $228.00

4. **Compare the two total costs:**
   - Total cost with membership = $212.00
   - Total cost without membership = $228.00

The least amount Arjun can spend on everything is the lower of the two totals.

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Yusuf is rolling a twenty-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row, than that he rolls four even numbers in a row?",50.0,"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events: rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row and rolling four even numbers in a row with a twenty-sided die.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5.

A twenty-sided die has the numbers 1 through 20. The numbers greater than 5 are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. 

Counting these, we find:
- Numbers greater than 5: 15 (from 6 to 20)

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is:
\[
P(\text{greater than 5}) = \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is:
\[
P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) = P(\text{greater than 5}) \times P(\text{greater than 5}) = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) \times \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \frac{9}{16}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the probability of rolling an even number.

The even numbers on a twenty-sided die are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20. 

Counting these, we find:
- Even numbers: 10 (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20)

The probability of rolling an even number is:
\[
P(\text{even}) = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling an even number four times in a row is:
\[
P(\text{even four times}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16}
\]

### Step 5: Compare the two probabilities.

Now we have:
- Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice: \(\frac{9}{16}\)
- Probability of rolling four even numbers: \(\frac{1}{16}\)

### Step 6: Calculate the difference in percentage points.

To express these probabilities as percentages:
- Probability of rolling greater than 5 twice:
\[
\frac{9}{16} \times 100 = 56.25\%
\]
- Probability of rolling four even numbers:
\[
\frac{1}{16} \times 100 = 6.25\%
\]

Now, we find the difference:
\[
\text{Difference} = 56.25\% - 6.25\% = 50\%
\]

### Final Answer

Yusuf is **50 percentage points** more likely to roll a number greater than 5 twice in a row than to roll four even numbers in a row.",5.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a twenty-sided die.**
   - The numbers greater than 5 on a twenty-sided die are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. 
   - There are 15 numbers greater than 5.
   - The total number of outcomes on a twenty-sided die is 20.
   - So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is:
     \[
     P(\text{greater than 5}) = \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row.**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is:
     \[
     P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) = P(\text{greater than 5}) \times P(\text{greater than 5}) = 0.75 \times 0.75 = 0.5625
     \]

3. **Determine the probability of rolling an even number on a twenty-sided die.**
   - The even numbers on a twenty-sided die are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20.
   - There are 10 even numbers.
   - So, the probability of rolling an even number is:
     \[
     P(\text{even}) = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]

4. **Calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row.**
   - The probability of rolling an even number four times in a row is:
     \[
     P(\text{even four times}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.5^4 = 0.0625
     \]

5. **Calculate the difference in probabilities.**
   - Now, we find the difference in percentage points between the two probabilities:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) - P(\text{even four times}) = 0.5625 - 0.0625 = 0.5
     \]

6. **Convert the difference to percentage points.**
   - To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     \text{Difference in percentage points} = 0.5 \times 100 = 50
     \]

Mia then found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. In addition, she saw 24 wasps, and 9 bees. What percentage of animals in the plot were rabbits?",20.0,"To find the percentage of animals in the plot that were rabbits, we first need to determine the total number of animals and the number of rabbits.

1. **Calculate the number of rabbits:**
   - Mia found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. 
   - Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
     \[
     \text{Number of rabbits} = \frac{26}{2} = 13

2. **Count the other animals:**
   - Mia saw 24 wasps.
   - Mia also saw 9 bees.
   - We already calculated that there are 13 rabbits.

3. **Calculate the total number of animals:**
   - Total animals = Number of rabbits + Number of wasps + Number of bees
   \[
   \text{Total animals} = 13 + 24 + 9 = 46

   - First, calculate \( \frac{13}{46} \):
   \[
   \frac{13}{46} \approx 0.2826

   \]
4. In addition, she saw 24 wasps.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in the plot:
- Total animals = Number of bees + Number of beetles + Number of rabbits + Number of wasps
- Total animals = 9 (bees) + 6 (beetles) + 13 (rabbits) + 24 (wasps) = 52

Next, we need to find the percentage of animals that were rabbits:
- The number of rabbits is 13.
- The percentage of rabbits is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of rabbits} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of rabbits}}{\text{Total animals}} \right) \times 100

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?",11000.0,"To determine how much more the total cost will be than Mrs. Lee's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the townhouse after applying the discount and adding the brokerage and transfer fees.

1. **Calculate the discount on the selling price:**
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = 400,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 25\% \text{ of Selling Price} = 0.25 \times 400,000 = 100,000

   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Discount} = 400,000 - 100,000 = 300,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee (5% of the selling price):**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 5\% \text{ of Selling Price} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the transfer fee (12% of the selling price):**
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 12\% \text{ of Selling Price} = 0.12 \times 400,000 = 48,000

1. **Calculate the legal fees:**
   - The selling price of the villa is $550,000.
   - The legal fees are 2% of the selling price.
   - Legal fees = 2% of $550,000 = 0.02 * 550,000 = $11,000.

2. **Calculate the realtor fee:**
   - The realtor fee is 5% of the selling price.
   - Realtor fee = 5% of $550,000 = 0.05 * 550,000 = $27,500.

3. **Calculate the total fees paid:**
   - Total fees = Legal fees + Realtor fee = $11,000 + $27,500 = $38,500.

4. **Calculate the net proceeds from the sale:**
   - Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees - Remaining loan amount - Closing costs.
   - Remaining loan amount = $440,000.
   - Closing costs = $5,000.
   - Net proceeds = $550,000 - $38,500 - $440,000 - $5,000 = $66,500.

5. **Calculate the investment growth over two years:**
   - The stocks gained 10% each year for two years.
   - After the first year, the value of the investment = Net proceeds + (10% of Net proceeds).
   - After the first year = $66,500 + (0.10 * $66,500) = $66,500 + $6,650 = $73,150.

1. **Total number of balls**: The juggler can juggle 160 balls.

2. **Golf balls**: 
   - \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the balls are golf balls.
   - Number of golf balls = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 160 = 32 \).

3. **Tennis balls**: 
   - The rest of the balls are tennis balls.
   - Number of tennis balls = Total balls - Golf balls = \( 160 - 32 = 128 \).

4. **Yellow golf balls**: 
   - \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the golf balls are yellow.
   - Number of yellow golf balls = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 32 = 16 \).

5. **Marked yellow golf balls**:

Since apples are a rare treat, he only buys four 3-kg boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys twelve 6-kg bags. Hay are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys thirty four 39-kg packs. Corn are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 17-kg sacks. Finally, he buys 43 kgs of groceries, and 27 kgs of tools, and 100 kgs of wood. A farm truck can carry 160 kgs at a time. If the farmer has three trucks, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the purchased items?",4.0,"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the purchased items, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the items he bought.

1. **Calculate the weight of apples:**

Later, Uma saw another 10-foot shark with 6 remoras, each 8 inches long, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?",45.0,"To find the average percentage of each shark's body length that is covered by the remoras, we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert the lengths of the sharks and remoras to the same unit (inches).**
2. **Calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each shark.**
3. **Determine the percentage of the shark's body length that is covered by the remoras.**
4. **Calculate the average percentage for both sharks.**

### Step 1: Convert lengths to inches

- The first shark is 40 feet long:
  \[
  40 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 480 \text{ inches}
  \]

- The second shark is 10 feet long:
  \[
  10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total length of the remoras

**For the first shark:**
- There are 18 remoras, each 16 inches long.
- Total length of remoras:
  \[
  18 \text{ remoras} \times 16 \text{ inches/remora} = 288 \text{ inches}
  \]

- After 1/6 of the remoras swim away:
  \[
  \text{Number of remoras that swam away} = \frac{1}{6} \times 18 = 3
  \]
- Remaining remoras:
  \[
  18 - 3 = 15 \text{ remoras}
  \]
- Total length of remaining remoras:
  \[
  15 \text{ remoras} \times 16 \text{ inches/remora} = 240 \text{ inches}
  \]

**For the second shark:**
- There are 6 remoras, each 8 inches long.
- Total length of remoras:
  \[
  6 \text{ remoras} \times 8 \text{ inches/remora} = 48 \text{ inches}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras

**For the first shark:**
- Percentage covered:
  \[
  \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100
  \]
  \[
  \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{240 \text{ inches}}{480 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = 50\%

### Step 4: Calculate the average percentage

- Average percentage:
  \[
  \text{Average} = \frac{50\% + 40\%}{2} = \frac{90\%}{2} = 45\%
  \]

### Final Answer

The average percentage of each shark's body length that is covered by the remoras is **45%**.",45.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the first shark:**
   - There are 18 remoras, each 16 inches long.
   - Total length of remoras = 18 * 16 = 288 inches.

2. **Convert the shark's length from feet to inches:**
   - The first shark is 40 feet long.
   - 1 foot = 12 inches, so 40 feet = 40 * 12 = 480 inches.

3. **Calculate the percentage of the first shark's body length covered by the remoras:**
   - Percentage = (Total length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100
   - Percentage for the first shark = (288 / 480) * 100 = 60%.

4. **Determine how many remoras swam away:**
   - 1/6 of the 18 remoras swam away.
   - Number of remoras that swam away = 18 / 6 = 3.
   - Remaining remoras = 18 - 3 = 15.

5. **Calculate the total length of the remaining remoras:**
   - Remaining remoras = 15, each 16 inches long.
   - Total length of remaining remoras = 15 * 16 = 240 inches.

6. **Calculate the percentage of the first shark's body length covered by the remaining remoras:**
   - Percentage for the remaining remoras = (240 / 480) * 100 = 50%.

7. **Now, calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the second shark:**
   - There are 6 remoras, each 8 inches long.
   - Total length of remoras = 6 * 8 = 48 inches.

8. **Convert the second shark's length from feet to inches:**
   - The second shark is 10 feet long.
   - 10 feet = 10 * 12 = 120 inches.

9. **Calculate the percentage of the second shark's body length covered by the remoras:**
   - Percentage for the second shark = (48 / 120) * 100 = 40%.

10. **Calculate the average percentage of both sharks' body lengths covered by the remoras:**
    - Average percentage = (Percentage for first shark + Percentage for second shark) / 2
    - Average percentage = (60 + 40) / 2 = 50%.

The answer is 50%.",50.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the first shark.

1. **First Shark:**
   - The first shark is 40 feet long.
   - There are 18 remoras, each 16 inches long.
   - First, we convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet: 
     \[
     16 \text{ inches} = \frac{16}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 1.33 \text{ feet}
     \]
   - Now, we calculate the total length of the remoras:
     \[
     \text{Total length of remoras} = 18 \times \frac{4}{3} = 24 \text{ feet}
     \]
   - Next, we find out how many remoras swam away:
     \[
     \frac{1}{6} \text{ of } 18 = 3 \text{ remoras}
     \]
   - So, the number of remoras left is:
     \[
     18 - 3 = 15 \text{ remoras}
     \]
   - Now, we calculate the new total length of the remaining remoras:
     \[
     \text{Total length of remaining remoras} = 15 \times \frac{4}{3} = 20 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Percentage of the first shark's body length covered by remoras:**
   - The percentage is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - For the first shark:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{40} \right) \times 100 = 50\%
     \]

3. **Second Shark:**
   - The second shark is 10 feet long.
   - There are 6 remoras, each 8 inches long.
   - Convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet:
     \[
     8 \text{ inches} = \frac{8}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 0.67 \text{ feet}
     \]
   - Now, we calculate the total length of the remoras:
     \[
     \text{Total length of remoras} = 6 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \text{ feet}
     \]

4. **Percentage of the second shark's body length covered by remoras:**
   - For the second shark:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{10} \right) \times 100 = 40\%
     \]

5. **Average percentage of both sharks:**
   - Now, we find the average percentage covered by remoras:
     \[
     \text{Average percentage} = \frac{50 + 40}{2} = 45\%

Carlos has 720 almonds, 7 bowls and 3 tables. Unfortunately, 2 tables break. Carlos then eats one-fifth of all the almonds. How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?",14.0,"To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the capacity of the bowls and tables.**
   - Each bowl can hold 24 almonds.
   - Each table can hold three times the amount of a bowl, which is:
     \[
     3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ almonds per table}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and tables before any tables break.**
   - Carlos has 7 bowls, so the total capacity of the bowls is:
     \[
     7 \times 24 = 168 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - Carlos has 3 tables, so the total capacity of the tables is:
     \[
     3 \times 72 = 216 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total capacity of all bowls and tables combined is:
     \[
     168 + 216 = 384 \text{ almonds}
     \]

3. **Account for the broken tables.**
   - After 2 tables break, Carlos has:
     \[
     3 - 2 = 1 \text{ table}
     \]
   - The capacity of the remaining table is:
     \[
     1 \times 72 = 72 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - The total capacity now with 7 bowls and 1 table is:
     \[
     168 + 72 = 240 \text{ almonds}

4. **Calculate how many almonds Carlos has after eating some.**
   - Carlos starts with 720 almonds and eats one-fifth of them:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} \times 720 = 144 \text{ almonds eaten}
     \]
   - The remaining almonds are:
     \[
     720 - 144 = 576 \text{ almonds}
     \]

5. **Determine how many more bowls are needed to hold the remaining almonds.**
   - Carlos can currently hold 240 almonds with the bowls and the remaining table.
   - To find out how many more bowls are needed, we first find out how many bowls are required to hold 576 almonds:
     \[
     \text{Number of bowls needed} = \frac{576}{24} = 24 \text{ bowls}
     \]
   - Carlos already has 7 bowls, so the additional bowls needed are:

Thus, Carlos needs **17 more bowls** to place all the remaining almonds.",17.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the capacity of the tables**: 
   Each bowl can hold 24 almonds. 
   Each table can hold three times that, so:
   \[
   \text{Capacity of each table} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ almonds}

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and tables**:
   Carlos has 7 bowls and 3 tables, but 2 tables break, leaving him with:
   \[
   \text{Remaining tables} = 3 - 2 = 1 \text{ table}
   \]
   Now, we calculate the total capacity:
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of bowls} = 7 \times 24 = 168 \text{ almonds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of remaining table} = 1 \times 72 = 72 \text{ almonds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = 168 + 72 = 240 \text{ almonds}
   \]

3. **Determine how many almonds Carlos has left after eating**:
   Carlos starts with 720 almonds. He eats one-fifth of all the almonds:
   \[
   \text{Almonds eaten} = \frac{1}{5} \times 720 = 144 \text{ almonds}
   \]
   So, the remaining almonds are:
   \[
   \text{Remaining almonds} = 720 - 144 = 576 \text{ almonds}
   \]

4. **Determine if the current capacity can hold the remaining almonds**:
   The total capacity of the bowls and the remaining table is 240 almonds, but Carlos has 576 almonds left. 
   Since 576 > 240, he does not have enough capacity.

5. **Calculate how many more bowls are needed**:
   First, we find out how many more almonds need to be accommodated:
   \[
   \text{Almonds that need to be accommodated} = 576 - 240 = 336 \text{ almonds}
   \]
   Each bowl holds 24 almonds, so the number of additional bowls needed is:

She wants to make a shawl, sweater, poncho, gloves, and mittens for each of them. It takes 5 skeins of wool to make a shawl, 6 for a sweater, 8 for a poncho, 8 for a pair of gloves, and 14 for a pair of mittens. Keisha wants to make two warm jackets for herself, each needing 8 skeins of wool. Each dozen skeins of wool costs $7. The store has a promotion where customers receive a $20 discount on purchases over $100. How much should Keisha pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?",85.0,"To find out how much Keisha should pay for all the skeins of wool she needs, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed for the grandchildren's items.**
2. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed for Keisha's jackets.**
3. **Sum the total skeins of wool needed.**
4. **Calculate the total cost before any discounts.**
5. **Apply the discount if applicable.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total skeins of wool for the grandchildren

- **Shawl:** 5 skeins per shawl × 4 grandchildren = 20 skeins
- **Sweater:** 6 skeins per sweater × 4 grandchildren = 24 skeins
- **Poncho:** 8 skeins per poncho × 4 grandchildren = 32 skeins
- **Gloves:** 8 skeins per pair of gloves × 4 grandchildren = 32 skeins
- **Mittens:** 14 skeins per pair of mittens × 4 grandchildren = 56 skeins

Now, we sum these amounts:

\[
20 + 24 + 32 + 32 + 56 = 164 \text{ skeins}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total skeins of wool for Keisha's jackets

- **Jackets:** 8 skeins per jacket × 2 jackets = 16 skeins

### Step 3: Sum the total skeins of wool needed

Now we add the skeins needed for the grandchildren and for Keisha:

\[
164 + 16 = 180 \text{ skeins}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost before any discounts

Each dozen skeins costs $7. First, we need to find out how many dozens are in 180 skeins:

\[
\text{Number of dozens} = \frac{180}{12} = 15 \text{ dozens}

Now, we calculate the total cost:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 15 \text{ dozens} \times 7 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 105 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Apply the discount

Since the total cost of $105 is over $100, Keisha qualifies for the $20 discount:

\[
\text{Final cost} = 105 - 20 = 85 \text{ dollars}

     \( 41 \times 4 = 164 \) skeins.

2. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed for Keisha:**
   - Keisha wants to make 2 jackets, each needing 8 skeins:
   - Total for jackets: 
     \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \) skeins.

3. **Calculate the overall total skeins of wool needed:**
   - Total skeins for grandchildren + Total skeins for Keisha:
   \( 164 + 16 = 180 \) skeins.

4. **Calculate the cost of the skeins of wool:**
   - Each dozen skeins costs $7. 
   - First, find out how many dozens are in 180 skeins:
   \( 180 \div 12 = 15 \) dozens.
   - Now, calculate the cost:
   \( 15 \times 7 = 105 \) dollars.

5. **Check if the discount applies:**
   - The total cost is $105, which is over $100, so Keisha gets a $20 discount.
   - Calculate the final cost after the discount:
   \( 105 - 20 = 85 \) dollars.

The answer is $85.",85.0,1,,85.0,1
gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,Mohammed goes to the store to buy some rice. The normal brand of rice he buys costs ¥15 per kg. He has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 3 kgs of rice per day. The store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs; any additional rice is sold at the regular price. Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2. How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,"To find out how much Mohammed has to pay, we can break down the problem into several steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of rice Mohammed needs for a week:**
   - Mohammed uses 3 kg of rice per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he needs:
     \[
     3 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 21 \, \text{kg}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost of the more expensive brand of rice:**
   - The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg.
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more:
     \[
     \text{Increase} = 15 \times 0.20 = 3 \, \text{¥}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost of more expensive brand} = 15 + 3 = 18 \, \text{¥/kg}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the first 10 kg of rice with the discount:**
   - The store has a 40% discount on rice up to 10 kg.
   - The discounted price per kg is:
     \[
     \text{Discounted price} = 18 \times (1 - 0.40) = 18 \times 0.60 = 10.8 \, \text{¥/kg}
     \]
   - The cost for the first 10 kg is:
     \[
     10 \, \text{kg} \times 10.8 \, \text{¥/kg} = 108 \, \text{¥}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the remaining rice (11 kg) at regular price:**
   - The remaining rice needed is:
     \[
     21 \, \text{kg} - 10 \, \text{kg} = 11 \, \text{kg}
     \]
   - The cost for the remaining 11 kg at the regular price (¥18 per kg) is:
     \[
     11 \, \text{kg} \times 18 \, \text{¥/kg} = 198 \, \text{¥}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the rice:**
   - Total cost of rice:
     \[
     108 \, \text{¥} + 198 \, \text{¥} = 306 \, \text{¥}
     \]

6. **Add the cost of the bagel:**
   - The cost of the bagel is ¥2.
   - Total cost including the bagel:
     \[
     306 \, \text{¥} + 2 \, \text{¥} = 308 \, \text{¥}
     \]

Therefore, the total amount Mohammed has to pay is **¥308**.",308.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice:**
   - The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg.
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more.
   - 20% of ¥15 is \( 0.20 \times 15 = ¥3 \).
   - Therefore, the cost of the more expensive brand is \( 15 + 3 = ¥18 \) per kg.

2. **Calculate the total amount of rice Mohammed needs for a week:**
   - Mohammed uses 3 kgs of rice per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he needs \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) kgs of rice.

3. **Calculate the cost of the first 10 kgs of rice with the discount:**
   - The store has a 40% discount on the first 10 kgs.
   - The price after the discount for the first 10 kgs is \( 18 \times 0.60 = ¥10.80 \) per kg.
   - Therefore, the cost for 10 kgs is \( 10 \times 10.80 = ¥108 \).

4. **Calculate the cost of the remaining rice:**
   - Mohammed needs a total of 21 kgs, so he needs an additional \( 21 - 10 = 11 \) kgs.
   - The cost for these 11 kgs at the regular price is \( 11 \times 18 = ¥198 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the rice:**
   - The total cost of the rice is \( 108 + 198 = ¥306 \).

6. **Add the cost of the bagel:**
   - The bagel costs ¥2.
   - Therefore, the total amount Mohammed has to pay is \( 306 + 2 = ¥308 \).

The answer is ¥308.",308.0,1,,308.0,1
gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Jasmine and Mia are sisters from Nairobi who love collecting signatures from authors. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Jasmine and Mia compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Jasmine has 36 signatures in her book, and Mia has 31. The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,"To find out how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week to reach their goal of 145 signatures, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total signatures they currently have:**
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   - Mia has 31 signatures.
   - Total signatures = 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

2. **Determine how many more signatures they need to reach their goal:**
   - Their goal is 145 signatures.
   - Signatures needed = 145 - 67 = 78 signatures.

3. **Determine Jasmine's collection over the next 2 weeks:**
   - Jasmine's current weekly collection is not explicitly given, but we know that she will collect 5 signatures less per week than she normally would.
   - Let's denote Jasmine's normal weekly collection as \( J \).
   - In the next 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect signatures only on weekends, which means she will collect \( J - 5 \) signatures each week.
   - Therefore, in 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect \( 2(J - 5) = 2J - 10 \) signatures.

4. **Determine Mia's collection over the next 2 weeks:**
   - Let \( M \) be the number of signatures Mia collects per week.
   - In 2 weeks, Mia will collect \( 2M \) signatures.

5. **Set up the equation for the total signatures collected in the next 2 weeks:**
   - The total signatures collected by both sisters in the next 2 weeks should equal the signatures needed to reach their goal:
   \[
   (2J - 10) + 2M = 78
   \]

6. **Rearranging the equation:**
   \[
   2M = 78 - (2J - 10)
   \]
   \[
   2M = 78 - 2J + 10
   \]
   \[
   2M = 88 - 2J
   \]
   \[
   M = 44 - J
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Mia needs to collect \( 44 - J \) signatures per week, where \( J \) is Jasmine's normal weekly collection.
   - Since we do not have the exact value of \( J \), we can express Mia's required collection in terms of Jasmine's collection.

If we assume Jasmine's normal weekly collection \( J \) is a reasonable number (for example, if we assume she collected 20 signatures per week before the reduction), we can substitute that value in to find Mia's required collection.

For example, if \( J = 20 \):
\[
M = 44 - 20 = 24
\]
So, Mia would need to collect 24 signatures per week.

To summarize, Mia needs to collect \( 44 - J \) signatures per week, where \( J \) is Jasmine's normal weekly collection. If you have a specific value for \( J \), you can substitute it to find the exact number of signatures Mia needs to collect.",44.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Current Signatures**: 
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   - Mia has 31 signatures.
   - Together, they have 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

2. **Goal**: 
   - They want to reach a total of 145 signatures.

3. **Signatures Needed**: 
   - To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the current total from their goal:
   - 145 - 67 = 78 signatures needed.

4. **Remaining Time**: 
   - They have 2 more weeks of spring break.

5. **Jasmine's Collection**: 
   - Jasmine can only collect signatures on weekends, and her weekly collection is reduced by 5 signatures per week.
   - Let's assume Jasmine originally collected \( x \) signatures per week. Therefore, her new collection per week is \( x - 5 \).
   - Over 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect \( 2(x - 5) \) signatures.

6. **Mia's Collection**: 
   - Let \( y \) be the number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week.
   - Over 2 weeks, Mia will collect \( 2y \) signatures.

7. **Total Signatures Collected in 2 Weeks**: 
   - The total signatures collected by both sisters in the remaining 2 weeks will be:
   - \( 2(x - 5) + 2y \).

8. **Setting Up the Equation**: 
   - We know that the total signatures collected in the remaining 2 weeks must equal the signatures needed:
   - \( 2(x - 5) + 2y = 78 \).

9. **Simplifying the Equation**: 
   - Dividing the entire equation by 2 gives:
   - \( (x - 5) + y = 39 \).

10. **Finding Mia's Required Collection**: 
    - Rearranging the equation gives:
    - \( y = 39 - (x - 5) \).
    - Simplifying further:
    - \( y = 39 - x + 5 \).
    - Thus, \( y = 44 - x \).

11. **Conclusion**: 
    - Mia needs to collect \( 44 - x \) signatures per week, where \( x \) is Jasmine's original weekly collection. 
    - Since we don't have the exact value of \( x \), we can conclude that Mia's required collection depends on Jasmine's original collection rate.

The answer is that Mia needs to collect \( 44 - x \) signatures per week, where \( x \) is Jasmine's original weekly collection.",44.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Jasmine currently has 36 signatures.
2. Mia currently has 31 signatures.
3. Together, they have collected: 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.
4. Their goal is to reach 145 signatures by the end of the break.
5. The number of signatures they still need to collect is: 145 - 67 = 78 signatures.
6. They have 2 weeks left to collect these signatures.
7. Jasmine's collection will decrease by 5 signatures per week, so in 2 weeks, she will collect: (5 signatures/week * 2 weeks) = 10 signatures less than she would normally collect.
8. Let’s assume Jasmine normally collects X signatures per week. Therefore, in 2 weeks, she would normally collect: 2X signatures.
9. However, due to the reduction, she will collect: 2X - 10 signatures in total over the 2 weeks.
10. Mia needs to collect enough signatures to make up the difference. Let’s denote Mia's required weekly collection as Y signatures.
11. In 2 weeks, Mia will collect: 2Y signatures.
12. The total signatures collected by both sisters in the remaining 2 weeks will be: (2X - 10) + 2Y.
13. We want this total to equal the remaining signatures needed: (2X - 10) + 2Y = 78.
14. Rearranging gives us: 2Y = 78 - (2X - 10).
15. Simplifying further: 2Y = 78 - 2X + 10, which leads to: 2Y = 88 - 2X.
16. Dividing everything by 2 gives us: Y = 44 - X.

Now, we need to determine how many signatures Jasmine would normally collect per week (X). Since we don't have that information, we can express Mia's required collection in terms of Jasmine's normal collection.

If Jasmine normally collects 20 signatures per week (as an example), then:
Y = 44 - 20 = 24 signatures per week.

If Jasmine normally collects 25 signatures per week, then:
Y = 44 - 25 = 19 signatures per week.

Thus, Mia's required collection per week depends on Jasmine's normal collection rate. 

To ensure they reach their goal, Mia needs to collect Y signatures per week, where Y = 44 - X, with X being Jasmine's normal weekly collection.

The answer is that Mia needs to collect (44 - X) signatures per week, where X is Jasmine's normal weekly collection.",44.0,0

He can make giant cubes that use 12 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 5 ounces, small cubes that use 1/2 of a ounce, and tiny cubes that are half the size of small cubes. He makes 48 total ice cubes, including 10 giant cubes, 14 small cubes, 12 medium cubes, and some tiny cubes. How many ounces of water does Leon have left?",122.0,"To find out how many ounces of water Leon has left after making the ice cubes, we first need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of ice cube he made.

1. **Giant Cubes**:
   - Number of giant cubes = 10
   - Water used per giant cube = 12 ounces
   - Total water used for giant cubes = \(10 \times 12 = 120\) ounces

2. **Medium Cubes**:
   - Number of medium cubes = 12
   - Water used per medium cube = 5 ounces
   - Total water used for medium cubes = \(12 \times 5 = 60\) ounces

3. **Small Cubes**:
   - Number of small cubes = 14
   - Water used per small cube = 0.5 ounces
   - Total water used for small cubes = \(14 \times 0.5 = 7\) ounces

4. **Tiny Cubes**:
   - Let \(x\) be the number of tiny cubes.
   - Water used per tiny cube = \(0.5 \div 2 = 0.25\) ounces
   - Total water used for tiny cubes = \(x \times 0.25\) ounces

Now, we know that the total number of ice cubes is 48. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
10 + 12 + 14 + x = 48
\]

Calculating the left side:

\[
36 + x = 48
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = 48 - 36 = 12

So, Leon made 12 tiny cubes.

Now we can calculate the total water used for the tiny cubes:

\[
\text{Total water used for tiny cubes} = 12 \times 0.25 = 3 \text{ ounces}

What percentage of the students like to play video games if the number of the students that like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football?",5.0,"To find the percentage of students who like to play video games, we first need to determine how many students like to bake and how many like to play video games.

1. **Identify the number of students with specific hobbies:**
   - Students who like to hike: 69
   - Students who like to play chess: 8
   - Students who like to swim: 13
   - Students who like to play football: 13

2. **Calculate the total number of students with known hobbies:**
   \[
   \text{Total with known hobbies} = 69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103
   \]

3. **Determine the number of students who like to bake:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of students who like to play football (which is given as 13). The number of students who like to bake is given by the expression:
   \[
   \text{Number who like to bake} = 4x - 3 = 4(13) - 3 = 52 - 3 = 49
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of students who like to play video games:**
   The total number of students in the class is 160. Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total students} = \text{Total with known hobbies} + \text{Number who like to bake} + \text{Number who like to play video games}

5. The number of students who like to play football is 13.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who have specified hobbies:

- Total students with specified hobbies = 69 (hike) + 8 (chess) + 13 (swim) + 13 (football)
- Total students with specified hobbies = 69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103

Next, we find out how many students are left who like either to play video games or bake:

- Students who like video games or bake = Total students - Students with specified hobbies
- Students who like video games or bake = 160 - 103 = 57

Now, we need to determine how many students like to bake. We know that the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number of students who like to play football:

- Number of students who like to play football = 13
- Four times the number of students who like to play football = 4 * 13 = 52
- Therefore, the number of students who like to bake = 52 - 3 = 49

Now, we can find the number of students who like to play video games:

- Students who like video games = Students who like video games or bake - Students who like to bake
- Students who like video games = 57 - 49 = 8

His friends have chipped in and will cover the cost of all the food for the workshop. Oliver has also applied for help from the local charity, which has decided to cover 1/10 of the remaining cost of the workshop. How much money is Oliver still missing?",113.0,"To determine how much money Oliver is still missing for the workshop, we first need to calculate the total cost of the workshop for both days.

1. **Calculate the total cost for one day:**
   - Hotel: ₣100
   - Food: ₣20
   - Transportation: ₣10

   Total cost for one day:
   \[
   100 + 20 + 10 = ₣130
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost for two days:**
   \[
   130 \times 2 = ₣260
   \]

3. **Determine the total cost of food for both days:**
   Since Oliver's friends are covering the cost of all the food, we need to calculate the food cost for both days:
   - Food for one day: ₣20
   - Total food cost for two days:
   \[
   20 \times 2 = ₣40
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining costs that Oliver needs to cover:**
   The remaining costs include the hotel and transportation for both days:
   - Hotel for two days: ₣100 \times 2 = ₣200
   - Transportation for two days: ₣10 \times 2 = ₣20

   Total remaining costs:
   \[
   200 + 20 = ₣220

5. **Calculate the amount covered by the local charity:**
   The charity will cover 1/10 of the remaining costs:
   \[
   \frac{1}{10} \times 220 = ₣22

6. **Calculate the remaining amount that Oliver needs to cover after the charity's contribution:**
   Subtract the charity's contribution from the remaining costs:
   \[
   220 - 22 = ₣198
   \]

7. **Determine how much money Oliver is still missing:**
   Oliver currently has ₣85, so we subtract this from the amount he still needs:
   \[
   198 - 85 = ₣113

Thus, Oliver is still missing **₣113**.",113.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost for one day:**
   - Hotel cost: ₣100
   - Food cost: ₣20 (covered by friends)
   - Transportation cost: ₣10
   - Total cost for one day = Hotel + Food + Transportation = ₣100 + ₣20 + ₣10 = ₣130

2. **Calculate the total cost for two days:**
   - Total cost for two days = 2 * Total cost for one day = 2 * ₣130 = ₣260

3. **Determine the amount Oliver needs to cover after friends pay for food:**
   - Since friends cover the food cost for both days, we need to subtract the food cost from the total cost.
   - Total food cost for two days = 2 * ₣20 = ₣40
   - Remaining cost after food = Total cost for two days - Total food cost = ₣260 - ₣40 = ₣220

4. **Calculate the amount covered by the local charity:**
   - The charity covers 1/10 of the remaining cost.
   - Amount covered by charity = 1/10 * Remaining cost = 1/10 * ₣220 = ₣22

5. **Determine the remaining cost after charity contribution:**
   - Remaining cost after charity = Remaining cost - Amount covered by charity = ₣220 - ₣22 = ₣198

The bakery has a promotion that if one buys 7 bagels or more, they get a 20% discount on bagels. How much more do 4 loaves of bread cost than 8 bagels?",12.0,"To find out how much more 4 loaves of bread cost than 8 bagels, we will first calculate the cost of the loaves of bread and the bagels, including any applicable discounts.

1. **Cost of a loaf of bread**: 
   \[
   \text{Cost of 1 loaf} = €5
   \]
   Therefore, the cost of 4 loaves of bread is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 4 loaves} = 4 \times €5 = €20
   \]

2. **Cost of a bagel**: 
   The cost of a bagel is one-fourth of the cost of a loaf of bread:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 1 bagel} = \frac{1}{4} \times €5 = €1.25
   \]
   Therefore, the cost of 8 bagels without any discount is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 8 bagels} = 8 \times €1.25 = €10
   \]

3. **Check for discount on bagels**: 
   Since we are buying 8 bagels, which is more than 7, we qualify for a 20% discount. The discount amount on the total cost of the bagels is:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 20\% \text{ of } €10 = 0.20 \times €10 = €2
   \]
   Therefore, the cost of 8 bagels after applying the discount is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 8 bagels after discount} = €10 - €2 = €8
   \]

4. **Calculate the difference in cost**: 
   Now we can find out how much more 4 loaves of bread cost than 8 bagels:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Cost of 4 loaves} - \text{Cost of 8 bagels after discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = €20 - €8 = €12
   \]

Thus, 4 loaves of bread cost **€12 more** than 8 bagels.",8.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The cost of one loaf of bread is €5.
2. Therefore, the cost of 4 loaves of bread is:
   \[
   4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ euros}
   \]

3. The cost of a bagel is one-fourth of a loaf of bread. So, the cost of one bagel is:
   \[
   \frac{5}{4} = 1.25 \text{ euros}
   \]

4. The cost of 8 bagels without any discount is:
   \[
   8 \times 1.25 = 10 \text{ euros}

5. Since the bakery has a promotion for buying 7 bagels or more, we need to calculate the cost of 8 bagels with a 20% discount. First, we find the total cost of 8 bagels:
   \[
   10 \text{ euros}

Elena has $98.39 and wants to buy 15 anchors from a bin at the store. She also needs 9 nails, each costing $0.61. Each anchor costs $0.26. Additionally, Elena picks up 10 gallons of paint. Jamal starts with $80 and wants 10 gallons of paint, each priced at $7.0, and 3 carpenter pencils, each costing $2. The store offers a 10% discount on paint for members. How much more money does Elena have left than Jamal after they leave the store?",8.0,"To find out how much more money Elena has left than Jamal after they leave the store, we need to calculate the total cost for each of them and then determine how much money they have left.

### Step 1: Calculate Elena's total expenses

1. **Cost of anchors**:
   - Price per anchor = $0.26
   - Number of anchors = 15
   - Total cost for anchors = \( 15 \times 0.26 = 3.90 \)

2. **Cost of nails**:
   - Price per nail = $0.61
   - Number of nails = 9
   - Total cost for nails = \( 9 \times 0.61 = 5.49 \)

3. **Cost of paint**:
   - Price per gallon of paint = (not given, but we will calculate it later)
   - Number of gallons of paint = 10
   - Total cost for paint = \( 10 \times \text{price per gallon} \)

   Since the price per gallon of paint is not provided, we will assume it is \( P \).

4. **Total cost for Elena**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Elena} = \text{Cost of anchors} + \text{Cost of nails} + \text{Cost of paint}
   \]
   \[
   = 3.90 + 5.49 + 10P
   \]
   \[
   = 9.39 + 10P
   \]

5. **Money left for Elena**:
   \[
   \text{Money left for Elena} = 98.39 - (9.39 + 10P)
   \]
   \[
   = 98.39 - 9.39 - 10P
   \]
   \[
   = 89.00 - 10P
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Jamal's total expenses

1. **Cost of paint**:
   - Price per gallon of paint = \( P \)
   - Number of gallons of paint = 10
   - Total cost for paint before discount = \( 10 \times P = 10P \)
   - Jamal gets a 10% discount on paint:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 0.10 \times 10P = 1.00P
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for paint after discount} = 10P - 1.00P = 9P
   \]

2. **Cost of carpenter pencils**:
   - Price per pencil = $2
   - Number of pencils = 3
   - Total cost for pencils = \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \)

3. **Total cost for Jamal**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Jamal} = \text{Cost of paint} + \text{Cost of pencils}
   \]
   \[
   = 9P + 6
   \]

4. **Money left for Jamal**:
   \[
   \text{Money left for Jamal} = 80 - (9P + 6)
   \]
   \[
   = 80 - 9P - 6
   \]
   \[
   = 74 - 9P
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in money left

Now we need to find out how much more money Elena has left than Jamal:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Money left for Elena} - \text{Money left for Jamal}
\]
\[
= (89.00 - 10P) - (74 - 9P)
\]
\[
= 89.00 - 10P - 74 + 9P
\]
\[
= 15.00 - P
\]

### Conclusion

The difference in the amount of money Elena has left compared to Jamal is \( 15.00 - P \). 

To find the exact difference, we need the price per gallon of paint \( P \). If you provide that, we can calculate the exact difference.",15.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate Elena's total expenses.**

- **Cost of anchors:**
  Each anchor costs $0.26, and Elena wants to buy 15 anchors.
  \[
  \text{Total cost of anchors} = 15 \times 0.26 = 3.90
  \]

- **Cost of nails:**
  Each nail costs $0.61, and Elena needs 9 nails.
  \[
  \text{Total cost of nails} = 9 \times 0.61 = 5.49
  \]

- **Cost of paint:**
  Elena picks up 10 gallons of paint, each priced at $7.00.
  \[
  \text{Total cost of paint} = 10 \times 7.00 = 70.00
  \]

- **Total expenses for Elena:**
  \[
  \text{Total expenses} = \text{Cost of anchors} + \text{Cost of nails} + \text{Cost of paint}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total expenses} = 3.90 + 5.49 + 70.00 = 79.39
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate how much money Elena has left.**
Elena starts with $98.39.
\[
\text{Money left for Elena} = 98.39 - 79.39 = 19.00
\]

**Step 3: Calculate Jamal's total expenses.**

- **Cost of paint for Jamal:**
  Jamal wants 10 gallons of paint, each priced at $7.00, but he gets a 10% discount.
  \[
  \text{Total cost of paint without discount} = 10 \times 7.00 = 70.00
  \]
  \[
  \text{Discount on paint} = 10\% \text{ of } 70.00 = 0.10 \times 70.00 = 7.00
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total cost of paint after discount} = 70.00 - 7.00 = 63.00
  \]

- **Cost of carpenter pencils:**
  Each pencil costs $2, and Jamal wants 3 pencils.
  \[
  \text{Total cost of pencils} = 3 \times 2 = 6.00
  \]

- **Total expenses for Jamal:**
  \[
  \text{Total expenses} = \text{Cost of paint} + \text{Cost of pencils}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total expenses} = 63.00 + 6.00 = 69.00

Due to the pandemic, 20 patients are admitted into the care facility each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks.",530.0,"To find the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rooms that are out of service.**
2. **Calculate the number of occupied rooms.**
3. **Calculate the number of unoccupied rooms.**
4. **Account for the daily admissions over 3 weeks.**
5. **Recalculate the number of unoccupied rooms after the admissions.**

### Step 1: Calculate the number of rooms that are out of service

The total capacity of the care facility is 1900 rooms. One-fourth of these rooms are out of service.

\[
\text{Rooms out of service} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475 \text{ rooms}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of occupied rooms

Since one-fourth of the total rooms are occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied rooms as follows:

\[
\text{Occupied rooms} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475 \text{ rooms}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of unoccupied rooms

First, we need to find the total number of rooms that are available for occupancy. This is the total number of rooms minus the rooms that are out of service.

\[
\text{Available rooms} = \text{Total rooms} - \text{Rooms out of service} = 1900 - 475 = 1425 \text{ rooms}
\]

Now, we can find the number of unoccupied rooms:

\[
\text{Unoccupied rooms} = \text{Available rooms} - \text{Occupied rooms} = 1425 - 475 = 950 \text{ rooms}
\]

### Step 4: Account for the daily admissions over 3 weeks

Next, we need to calculate how many patients are admitted over 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks have:

\[
3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
\]

With 20 patients admitted each day, the total number of admissions over 3 weeks is:

\[
\text{Total admissions} = 20 \text{ patients/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ patients}
\]

### Step 5: Recalculate the number of unoccupied rooms after the admissions

Now we need to adjust the number of occupied rooms after these admissions. The new number of occupied rooms will be:

\[
\text{New occupied rooms} = \text{Initial occupied rooms} + \text{Total admissions} = 475 + 420 = 895 \text{ rooms}
\]

Finally, we can recalculate the number of unoccupied rooms:

\[
\text{New unoccupied rooms} = \text{Available rooms} - \text{New occupied rooms} = 1425 - 895 = 530 \text{ rooms}
\]

### Conclusion

The total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks is:

\[
\boxed{530}
\]",530.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. The total capacity of the care facility is 1900 rooms.
2. One-fourth of the rooms are occupied. So, the number of occupied rooms is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475 \text{ rooms}
   \]
3. One-fourth of all the rooms are out of service. So, the number of rooms out of service is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475 \text{ rooms}
   \]
4. Now, we can calculate the total number of rooms that are either occupied or out of service:
   \[
   475 \text{ (occupied)} + 475 \text{ (out of service)} = 950 \text{ rooms}
   \]
5. To find the number of unoccupied rooms, we subtract the occupied and out of service rooms from the total capacity:
   \[
   1900 - 950 = 950 \text{ unoccupied rooms}
   \]
6. Next, we need to account for the 20 patients admitted each day for 3 weeks. First, we calculate the total number of days in 3 weeks:
   \[
   3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]
7. Now, we calculate the total number of patients admitted in 3 weeks:
   \[
   20 \text{ patients/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ patients}
   \]
8. Since these patients will occupy rooms, we need to subtract the number of patients from the unoccupied rooms:
   \[
   950 \text{ unoccupied rooms} - 420 \text{ patients} = 530 \text{ unoccupied rooms}
   \]

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Faisal is selling muffins and apricot pies for a fundraiser. On Wednesday, he sold 27 boxes of muffin and 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie, than on Thursday. On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday and 21 boxes of apricot pie. On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?",796.0,"To find Faisal's average daily earning, we first need to determine how many boxes of muffins and apricot pies he sold on each day (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday).

### Step 1: Determine Sales on Wednesday
Let:
- \( m_W \) = number of boxes of muffins sold on Wednesday
- \( a_W \) = number of boxes of apricot pies sold on Wednesday

From the problem, we know:
- \( m_W = 27 \)
- \( a_W = m_W - 13 = 27 - 13 = 14 \)

### Step 2: Determine Sales on Thursday
Let:
- \( m_T \) = number of boxes of muffins sold on Thursday
- \( a_T \) = number of boxes of apricot pies sold on Thursday

From the problem, we know:
- \( m_T = m_W + 11 = 27 + 11 = 38 \)
- \( a_T = 21 \)

### Step 3: Determine Sales on Friday
Let:
- \( m_F \) = number of boxes of muffins sold on Friday
- \( a_F \) = number of boxes of apricot pies sold on Friday

From the problem, we know:
- The total sales on Friday is equal to the total sales from Wednesday and Thursday combined.

Calculating total sales from Wednesday and Thursday:
- Total muffins sold = \( m_W + m_T = 27 + 38 = 65 \)
- Total apricot pies sold = \( a_W + a_T = 14 + 21 = 35 \)

Thus, the total sales on Friday:
- \( m_F + a_F = 65 + 35 = 100 \)

### Step 4: Determine the Distribution of Sales on Friday
Let’s assume Faisal sold \( x \) boxes of muffins and \( y \) boxes of apricot pies on Friday. We know:
- \( x + y = 100 \)

We also need to find a reasonable distribution. Since we don't have specific information about the ratio of muffins to apricot pies sold on Friday, we can assume he sold the same number of muffins and apricot pies as he did on the previous days. 

However, we can also calculate the average earnings based on the total sales.

### Step 5: Calculate Earnings
Now we can calculate the earnings for each day.

**Earnings on Wednesday:**
- Muffins: \( 27 \times 9 = 243 \)
- Apricot pies: \( 14 \times 21 = 294 \)
- Total earnings on Wednesday: \( 243 + 294 = 537 \)

**Earnings on Thursday:**
- Muffins: \( 38 \times 9 = 342 \)
- Apricot pies: \( 21 \times 21 = 441 \)
- Total earnings on Thursday: \( 342 + 441 = 783 \)

**Earnings on Friday:**
Since we know \( m_F + a_F = 100 \), we can assume a reasonable distribution. Let’s say he sold 50 muffins and 50 apricot pies (this is just an assumption for calculation purposes):
- Muffins: \( 50 \times 9 = 450 \)
- Apricot pies: \( 50 \times 21 = 1050 \)
- Total earnings on Friday: \( 450 + 1050 = 1500 \)

### Step 6: Calculate Total Earnings and Average
Now we can calculate the total earnings over the three days:
- Total earnings = \( 537 + 783 + 1500 = 2820 \)

Now, we find the average daily earning:
- Average daily earning = \( \frac{2820}{3} = 940 \)

### Conclusion
Faisal's average daily earning is **₺940**.",940.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the number of boxes sold on Wednesday:**
   - Faisal sold 27 boxes of muffins on Wednesday.
   - He sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pies than on Thursday. 

2. **Determine the number of boxes sold on Thursday:**
   - On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday.

     \[
     27 + 11 = 38 \text{ boxes}
     \]
   - He sold 21 boxes of apricot pies on Thursday.

3. **Calculate the total boxes sold on Wednesday:**
   - Since he sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pies than on Thursday, the number of apricot pies sold on Wednesday is:
     \[
     21 - 13 = 8 \text{ boxes}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total boxes sold on Friday:**
   - On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined.
   - Total boxes sold on Wednesday:
     \[
     27 \text{ (muffins)} + 8 \text{ (apricot pies)} = 35 \text{ boxes}
     \]
   - Total boxes sold on Thursday:
     \[
     38 \text{ (muffins)} + 21 \text{ (apricot pies)} = 59 \text{ boxes}
     \]
   - Total boxes sold in the past two days:
     \[
     35 + 59 = 94 \text{ boxes}
     \]
   - Therefore, on Friday, he sold 94 boxes.

5. **Calculate the total earnings for each day:**
   - **Earnings on Wednesday:**
     - Muffins: \(27 \times 9 = ₺243\)
     - Apricot pies: \(8 \times 21 = ₺168\)
     - Total earnings on Wednesday:
     \[
     243 + 168 = ₺411
     \]

   - **Earnings on Thursday:**
     - Muffins: \(38 \times 9 = ₺342\)
     - Apricot pies: \(21 \times 21 = ₺441\)
     - Total earnings on Thursday:
     \[
     342 + 441 = ₺783
     \]

   - **Earnings on Friday:**
     - Total boxes sold on Friday: 94 boxes.
     - Since he sold 94 boxes, we need to determine how many of each type he sold. However, we can calculate the average earnings based on the previous days' sales.
     - Average earnings per box sold (from Wednesday and Thursday):
     \[
     \text{Total earnings from Wednesday and Thursday} = 411 + 783 = ₺1194
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total boxes sold from Wednesday and Thursday} = 35 + 59 = 94
     \]
     \[
     \text{Average earning per box} = \frac{1194}{94} = ₺12.70
     \]
     - Therefore, on Friday, his earnings would be:
     \[
     94 \times 12.70 = ₺1,187.80
     \]

6. **Calculate the total earnings for all three days:**
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 411 + 783 + 1187.80 = ₺2381.80
   \]

7. **Calculate the average daily earning:**
   - There are 3 days in total.
   \[
   \text{Average daily earning} = \frac{2381.80}{3} = ₺794.00

   - On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday.
   - So, the number of muffins sold on Thursday is 27 + 11 = 38 boxes.
   - On Thursday, he sold 21 boxes of apricot pies.

3. **Calculate the total boxes sold on Wednesday:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apricot pies sold on Wednesday.
   - Since he sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pies on Wednesday than on Thursday, we have:
     \[
     x + 13 = 21 \implies x = 21 - 13 = 8
     \]
   - Therefore, on Wednesday, he sold 8 boxes of apricot pies.

4. **Calculate total boxes sold on Friday:**
   - On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined.
   - Total boxes sold on Wednesday = 27 (muffins) + 8 (apricot pies) = 35 boxes.
   - Total boxes sold on Thursday = 38 (muffins) + 21 (apricot pies) = 59 boxes.
   - Total boxes sold in the past two days = 35 + 59 = 94 boxes.
   - Therefore, on Friday, he sold 94 boxes.

5. **Calculate total earnings for each day:**

On Tuesday, he picks half the amount of what he picked in the past 3 days combined. On Wednesday, Andre is going to sell pineapples in boxes of 21 pineapples each. He is going to sell each box for $8. How much is Andre going to make?",408.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Pineapples picked on each day:**
   - Saturday: 177 pineapples
   - Sunday: 183 pineapples
   - Monday: Double the amount picked on Saturday:
     \[
     \text{Monday's pineapples} = 2 \times 177 = 354 \text{ pineapples}
     \]

2. **Total pineapples picked from Saturday to Monday:**
   \[
   \text{Total for Saturday, Sunday, and Monday} = 177 + 183 + 354
   \]
   Let's calculate that:
   \[
   177 + 183 = 360
   \]
   \[
   360 + 354 = 714
   \]
   So, Andre picked a total of 714 pineapples from Saturday to Monday.

3. **Pineapples picked on Tuesday:**
   - Tuesday: Half of the total picked in the past 3 days:
   \[
   \text{Tuesday's pineapples} = \frac{714}{2} = 357 \text{ pineapples}
   \]

4. **Total pineapples picked from Saturday to Tuesday:**
   \[
   \text{Total for Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday} = 177 + 183 + 354 + 357
   \]
   Let's calculate that:
   \[
   177 + 183 = 360
   \]
   \[
   360 + 354 = 714
   \]
   \[
   714 + 357 = 1071
   \]
   So, Andre picked a total of 1071 pineapples from Saturday to Tuesday.

5. **Boxes of pineapples:**
   - Each box contains 21 pineapples. To find out how many boxes Andre can sell:
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{1071}{21}
   \]
   Let's calculate that:
   \[
   1071 \div 21 = 51

   (since \(21 \times 51 = 1071\))

6. **Total earnings from selling the boxes:**
   - Each box sells for $8:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 51 \times 8

   Let's calculate that:
   \[
   51 \times 8 = 408

1. On Saturday, Andre picks 177 pineapples.
2. On Sunday, he picks 183 pineapples.
3. On Monday, he picks double the number of pineapples he did on Saturday, which is 2 * 177 = 354 pineapples.
4. Now, let's calculate the total number of pineapples picked over the three days:
   - Saturday: 177
   - Sunday: 183
   - Monday: 354
   - Total = 177 + 183 + 354 = 714 pineapples.
5. On Tuesday, he picks half the amount of what he picked in the past 3 days combined, which is 714 / 2 = 357 pineapples.
6. Now, let's calculate the total number of pineapples Andre has after Tuesday:
   - Total = 177 + 183 + 354 + 357 = 1071 pineapples.
7. On Wednesday, he is going to sell the pineapples in boxes of 21 pineapples each. 
   - The number of boxes he can fill is 1071 / 21 = 51 boxes (since 1071 divided by 21 equals 51 with a remainder).

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 50% for the second half. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?",1755.0,"To find out how many pizzas the family eats in two months, we will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the daily pizza consumption of each family member.

- Uncle: 10 pizzas per day
- Spouse: 20 pizzas per day

Now, we calculate the combined daily consumption of the uncle and spouse:

\[
\text{Combined daily consumption} = 10 + 20 = 30 \text{ pizzas}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the grandchild's pizza consumption.

The grandchild eats two-fourths (which is equivalent to one-half) of the combined number of pizzas eaten by the uncle and spouse:

\[
\text{Grandchild's consumption} = \frac{2}{4} \times 30 = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ pizzas}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total daily consumption for the family.

Now, we add the grandchild's consumption to the combined consumption of the uncle and spouse:

\[
\text{Total daily consumption} = 30 + 15 = 45 \text{ pizzas}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total consumption for the first month.

Assuming there are 30 days in the month, the total consumption for the first month is:

\[
\text{Total for first month} = 45 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 1350 \text{ pizzas}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the consumption for the second month with the diet.

#### First half of the second month (15 days):

The family reduces their consumption by 60%. Therefore, they will eat:

\[
\text{Reduced consumption} = 45 \text{ pizzas} \times (1 - 0.60) = 45 \times 0.40 = 18 \text{ pizzas/day}
\]

Now, we calculate the total for the first half of the second month:

\[
\text{Total for first half} = 18 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 270 \text{ pizzas}
\]

#### Second half of the second month (15 days):

In the second half of the month, they reduce their consumption by an additional 50%. Therefore, their new consumption will be:

\[
\text{Further reduced consumption} = 18 \text{ pizzas} \times (1 - 0.50) = 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \text{ pizzas/day}
\]

Now, we calculate the total for the second half of the second month:

\[
\text{Total for second half} = 9 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ pizzas}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total consumption for the second month.

Now, we add the totals from both halves of the second month:

\[
\text{Total for second month} = 270 + 135 = 405 \text{ pizzas}
\]

### Step 7: Calculate the total consumption for both months.

Finally, we add the total consumption from the first month and the second month:

\[
\text{Total for both months} = 1350 + 405 = 1755 \text{ pizzas}

     \[
     \text{Grandchild's consumption} = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ pizzas}

2. **Seats reserved for graduates**: 700 seats
3. **Seats reserved for faculty**: 450 seats
4. **Seats reserved for staff**: 50 seats

Now, we can calculate the total number of seats that are reserved:

\[
\text{Total reserved seats} = \text{Seats for graduates} + \text{Seats for faculty} + \text{Seats for staff}

1. **Calculate the number of emails that require a response each day:**
   - Mohammed receives 30 emails a day.
   - 20% of those emails don't require a response.
   - The number of emails that don't require a response is:
     \[
     0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ emails}
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of emails that require a response is:
     \[
     30 - 6 = 24 \text{ emails}
     \]

2. **Calculate how many emails Mohammed can respond to each day:**
   - Mohammed can respond to 2 less than half of the emails that require a response.
   - Half of the emails that require a response is:
     \[
     \frac{24}{2} = 12

   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ emails}

5. Now, we subtract 2 from this amount:
   \[
   12 - 2 = 10 \text{ emails he can respond to each day}

On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?",85.0,"To solve the problem, we need to determine Ananya's walking speeds and the time taken for each segment of her walk.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( r \) be Ananya's original speed on the beach (in miles per hour).
   - Then her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2r \) (since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk).

2. **Injury Impact:**
   - After her injury, her speed on the beach becomes \( \frac{r}{2} \).
   - Her speed on the sidewalk becomes \( \frac{2r}{2} = r \).

3. **Time Spent on the Beach:**
   - We know Ananya spends 50 minutes walking on the beach. We need to convert this time into hours for consistency with speed (since speed is in miles per hour):
   \[
   50 \text{ minutes} = \frac{50}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{5}{6} \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Distance on the Beach:**
   - The distance she walks on the beach is 10 miles. Using the formula for time, \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \), we can express the time spent on the beach as:
   \[
   \frac{5}{6} = \frac{10}{\frac{r}{2}}
   \]
   - Rearranging gives:
   \[
   \frac{5}{6} = \frac{20}{r}
   \]
   - Cross-multiplying yields:
   \[
   5r = 120 \implies r = 24 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

5. **Calculate Speeds After Injury:**
   - After her injury, her speed on the beach is:
   \[
   \frac{r}{2} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]
   - Her speed on the sidewalk is:
   \[
   r = 24 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

6. **Time Spent on the Sidewalk:**
   - The distance she walks on the sidewalk is 14 miles. The time taken to walk this distance at her post-injury speed is:
   \[
   \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{14}{24} \text{ hours}
   \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   \frac{14}{24} = \frac{7}{12} \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Total Time for the Walk:**
   - Now, we can find the total time for the entire 24-mile walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{5}{6} + \frac{7}{12}
   \]
   - To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 12 is 12:
   \[
   \frac{5}{6} = \frac{10}{12}
   \]
   - Now we can add:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{10}{12} + \frac{7}{12} = \frac{17}{12} \text{ hours}
   \]

8. **Convert Total Time to Minutes:**
   - To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60:
   \[
   \text{Total time in minutes} = \frac{17}{12} \times 60 = 85 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Ananya to complete her entire 24-mile walk is \( \boxed{85} \) minutes.",85.0,1,"A: Let's think step by step.

1. Ananya walks a total of 24 miles every day, which includes 10 miles on the beach and 14 miles on the sidewalk.

2. We know that she spends 50 minutes walking on the beach. 

3. Let's determine her speed on the beach. Let’s denote her original speed on the beach as \( v \). Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v \) (twice the speed of the beach).

4. Since she has an injury, her speed on the beach is now \( \frac{v}{2} \) and her speed on the sidewalk is \( \frac{2v}{2} = v \).

5. We can calculate the time it takes her to walk on the beach:
   - Distance on the beach = 10 miles
   - Speed on the beach (after injury) = \( \frac{v}{2} \)
   - Time on the beach = Distance / Speed = \( \frac{10}{\frac{v}{2}} = \frac{10 \times 2}{v} = \frac{20}{v} \)

6. We know from the problem that she spends 50 minutes on the beach, so:
   \[
   \frac{20}{v} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   To find \( v \), we can rearrange this equation:
   \[
   20 = 50v \implies v = \frac{20}{50} = \frac{2}{5} \text{ miles per minute}
   \]

7. Now, we can find her speed on the sidewalk after the injury:
   - Speed on the sidewalk = \( v = \frac{2}{5} \text{ miles per minute} \)

8. Next, we calculate the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk:
   - Distance on the sidewalk = 14 miles
   - Speed on the sidewalk = \( \frac{2}{5} \text{ miles per minute} \)
   - Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = \( \frac{14}{\frac{2}{5}} = 14 \times \frac{5}{2} = 35 \text{ minutes} \)

9. Finally, we can find the total time for her entire 24-mile walk:
   - Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk = 50 minutes + 35 minutes = 85 minutes.

The answer is 85 minutes.",85.0,1,,85.0,1

7. Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier:
   \[
   \text{Mohammed's cookies} = \frac{8}{8} = 1

However, this week, 9 apartments from each of the first 2 complexes were vacant and did not require collection service. Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each place and he gets paid ₣0.5 per collection for each apartment. He also earns an additional 10% in tips. How much money does he make in a week?",1243.0,"To calculate how much money Oscar makes in a week, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of apartments in each complex.**
   - The first two complexes each have 100 apartments.
   - The total number of apartments in the first two complexes is:
     \[
     100 + 100 = 200 \text{ apartments}
     \]
   - The last complex is 35% bigger than the first two combined. Therefore, the number of apartments in the last complex is:
     \[
     200 + (0.35 \times 200) = 200 + 70 = 270 \text{ apartments}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of apartments.**
   - The total number of apartments across all three complexes is:
     \[
     200 + 270 = 470 \text{ apartments}

How much would a 60-minute call cost?",24.0,"To calculate the cost of a 60-minute call from the phone booth, we will break it down into three segments based on the pricing structure:

1. **First 10 minutes**: 
   - Cost per minute: ₺0.8
   - Total cost for 10 minutes: 
     \[
     10 \text{ minutes} \times ₺0.8/\text{minute} = ₺8.0

2. **Next 30 minutes (from minute 11 to minute 40)**: 
   - Cost per minute: ₺0.7
   - Total cost for 30 minutes: 
     \[
     30 \text{ minutes} \times ₺0.7/\text{minute} = ₺21.0
     \]

3. **Last 20 minutes (from minute 41 to minute 60)**: 
   - Cost per two minutes: ₺0.1
   - Since there are 20 minutes, we have:

If there are 30 bricks in the building in total, what percentage of bricks are green?",50.0,"To find the percentage of green bricks in the building, we first need to determine the number of each type of brick.

1. **Identify the number of white bricks:**
   - There are 5 white bricks.

2. **Determine the number of orange bricks:**
   - The problem states there are twice as many orange bricks as white bricks. Therefore, the number of orange bricks is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ orange bricks}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of white and orange bricks:**
   - The total number of white and orange bricks is:
   \[
   5 \text{ (white)} + 10 \text{ (orange)} = 15 \text{ bricks}
   \]

4. **Find the total number of bricks in the building:**
   - The total number of bricks in the building is given as 30.

5. **Calculate the number of green bricks:**
   - To find the number of green bricks, we subtract the total number of white and orange bricks from the total number of bricks:
   \[
   30 \text{ (total)} - 15 \text{ (white and orange)} = 15 \text{ green bricks}
   \]

6. **Calculate the percentage of green bricks:**
   - The percentage of green bricks is calculated by dividing the number of green bricks by the total number of bricks and then multiplying by 100:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of green bricks} = \left( \frac{15 \text{ (green)}}{30 \text{ (total)}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
   \]

Thus, the percentage of bricks that are green is \( \boxed{50\%} \).",50.0,1,"Let's think step by step.  
1. The building has 5 white bricks.  
2. It has twice as many orange bricks as white bricks, so the number of orange bricks is 2 * 5 = 10.  
3. Now, we can find the total number of white and orange bricks: 5 (white) + 10 (orange) = 15 bricks.  
4. The total number of bricks in the building is 30.  
5. To find the number of green bricks, we subtract the number of white and orange bricks from the total: 30 - 15 = 15 green bricks.  
6. Now, we need to find the percentage of green bricks. The formula for percentage is (part/whole) * 100. Here, the part is the number of green bricks (15) and the whole is the total number of bricks (30).  
7. So, the percentage of green bricks is (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.  

The answer is 50%.",50.0,1,,50.0,1

Olivia, who is younger than Bodhi but older than Keisha, will be 42 in 7 years. How much younger is Keisha than the average age of all three?",18.0,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Olivia, Bodhi, and Keisha based on the information provided.

1. **Determine Olivia's current age:**
   - Olivia will be 42 in 7 years.
   - Therefore, her current age is:
     \[
     42 - 7 = 35 \text{ years old}
     \]

2. **Determine Bodhi's current age:**
   - Olivia is currently 35 years old and is younger than Bodhi by 24 years.
   - Therefore, Bodhi's current age is:
     \[
     35 + 24 = 59 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Determine Keisha's current age:**
   - Olivia is currently 35 years old and is older than Keisha by 15 years.
   - Therefore, Keisha's current age is:
     \[
     35 - 15 = 20 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Calculate the average age of Olivia, Bodhi, and Keisha:**
   - The sum of their ages is:
     \[
     35 + 59 + 20 = 114
     \]
   - The average age is:
     \[
     \frac{114}{3} = 38 \text{ years old}
     \]

5. **Determine how much younger Keisha is than the average age:**
   - The difference between the average age and Keisha's age is:
     \[
     38 - 20 = 18
     \]

Thus, Keisha is **18 years younger** than the average age of all three.",18.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine Olivia's current age**: 
   - Olivia will be 42 in 7 years, so her current age is 42 - 7 = 35 years.

2. **Determine Bodhi's current age**: 
   - Olivia is 24 years younger than Bodhi. Therefore, Bodhi's current age is 35 + 24 = 59 years.

3. **Determine Keisha's current age**: 
   - Olivia is 15 years older than Keisha. Therefore, Keisha's current age is 35 - 15 = 20 years.

4. **Calculate the average age of Olivia, Bodhi, and Keisha**: 
   - The total age of all three is 35 (Olivia) + 59 (Bodhi) + 20 (Keisha) = 114 years.
   - The average age is 114 / 3 = 38 years.

5. **Determine how much younger Keisha is than the average age**:
