But as I pour it, I spill 5 liters of the peach drink. How much water is in the remaining 31 liters?",7.0,"To find out how much water is in the remaining 31 liters of the mixture, we will first calculate the amount of water in both the peach drink and the lemon drink before the spill, and then account for the spill.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the peach drink:**
   - The peach drink is 20 liters, and it is \( \frac{1}{5} \) water.
   - Amount of water in the peach drink:
     \[
     \text{Water in peach drink} = 20 \text{ liters} \times \frac{1}{5} = 4 \text{ liters}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the lemon drink:**
   - The lemon drink is 16 liters, and it is \( \frac{1}{4} \) water.
   - Amount of water in the lemon drink:
     \[
     \text{Water in lemon drink} = 16 \text{ liters} \times \frac{1}{4} = 4 \text{ liters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water before the spill:**
   - Total water before the spill:
     \[
     \text{Total water} = \text{Water in peach drink} + \text{Water in lemon drink} = 4 \text{ liters} + 4 \text{ liters} = 8 \text{ liters}
     \]

4. **Account for the spill:**
   - The spill is 5 liters of the peach drink. Since the peach drink is \( \frac{1}{5} \) water, we need to calculate how much water is in the spilled portion.
   - Amount of water in the spilled peach drink:
     \[
     \text{Water in spilled peach drink} = 5 \text{ liters} \times \frac{1}{5} = 1 \text{ liter}

     \text{Remaining volume} = 20 \text{ liters} - 5 \text{ liters} + 16 \text{ liters} = 31 \text{ liters}
     \]

Thus, the amount of water in the remaining 31 liters of the mixture is \( \boxed{7} \) liters.",7.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the peach drink:**
   - The total amount of peach drink is 20 liters.
   - The peach drink is 1/5 water.
   - So, the amount of water in the peach drink is \( 20 \times \frac{1}{5} = 4 \) liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the lemon drink:**
   - The total amount of lemon drink is 16 liters.
   - The lemon drink is 1/4 water.
   - So, the amount of water in the lemon drink is \( 16 \times \frac{1}{4} = 4 \) liters.

3. **Calculate the total amount of water before the spill:**
   - The total amount of water from both drinks before the spill is \( 4 \) liters (from peach drink) + \( 4 \) liters (from lemon drink) = \( 8 \) liters.

4. **Calculate the amount of peach drink remaining after the spill:**
   - Initially, there are 20 liters of peach drink.

If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 6 hours if she spends 2/4 of the time running and three-sixths of the time walking?",36.0,"To solve the problem, we need to determine Jasmine's walking speed, running speed, and then calculate the distance she can travel in 6 hours based on the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Jasmine's skipping speed**:
   - We know that Jasmine can skip at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

2. **Find Jasmine's running speed**:
   - It is given that she can skip at a rate of speed that is \( \frac{3}{5} \) as fast as she can run.
   - Let \( r \) be her running speed. Then:
     \[
     \frac{3}{5} r = 6
     \]
   - To find \( r \), we can rearrange the equation:
     \[
     r = 6 \times \frac{5}{3} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

3. **Find Jasmine's walking speed**:
   - It is given that Jasmine can run five times faster than she can walk.
   - Let \( w \) be her walking speed. Then:
     \[
     r = 5w
     \]
   - We already found \( r = 10 \), so:
     \[
     10 = 5w
     \]
   - Solving for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

4. **Calculate the time spent running and walking**:
   - Jasmine spends \( \frac{2}{4} \) of the time running and \( \frac{3}{6} \) of the time walking.
   - First, simplify these fractions:
     - \( \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \)
     - \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \)
   - This means she spends half of the time running and half of the time walking.

5. **Determine the time spent running and walking in 6 hours**:
   - Total time = 6 hours.
   - Time spent running:
     \[
     \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time spent walking:
     \[
     \text{Time walking} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

6. **Calculate the distance traveled while running and walking**:
   - Distance while running:
     \[
     \text{Distance running} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Distance while walking:
     \[
     \text{Distance walking} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 2 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}
     \]

7. **Total distance traveled**:
   - Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = 30 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 36 \text{ miles}
     \]

Thus, the total distance Jasmine can travel in 6 hours is \( \boxed{36} \) miles.",36.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine Jasmine's running speed**: 
   - We know that Jasmine can skip at 6 miles per hour.
   - She skips at a speed that is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of her running speed.
   - Let \( r \) be her running speed. Then, we have:
     \[
     \frac{3}{5} r = 6
     \]
   - To find \( r \), we can multiply both sides by \( \frac{5}{3} \):
     \[
     r = 6 \times \frac{5}{3} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

2. **Determine Jasmine's walking speed**:
   - Jasmine runs five times faster than she walks. Let \( w \) be her walking speed. Then:
     \[
     r = 5w
     \]
   - We already found \( r = 10 \), so:
     \[
     10 = 5w
     \]
   - Dividing both sides by 5 gives:
     \[
     w = 2 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time Jasmine travels**:
   - She travels for 6 hours in total.

4. **Determine the time spent running and walking**:
   - She spends \( \frac{2}{4} \) of the time running, which simplifies to \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the time.
   - Therefore, the time spent running is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - The remaining time spent walking is also \( 3 \) hours (since \( 6 - 3 = 3 \)).

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while running**:
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - While running, she travels:
     \[
     \text{Distance running} = r \times \text{time running} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
     \]

6. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking**:
   - While walking, she travels:
     \[
     \text{Distance walking} = w \times \text{time walking} = 2 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}
     \]

7. **Calculate the total distance traveled**:
   - The total distance is the sum of the distances while running and walking:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 30 + 6 = 36 \text{ miles}

Thus, the number of 30-minute episodes Theo watched on Thursday is \( \boxed{5} \).",5.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total hours watched on Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   - On Tuesday, Theo watched a 6-hour episode.
   - On Wednesday, he watched another 6-hour episode.
   - Total for Tuesday and Wednesday = 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

2. **Calculate the hours watched on Friday:**
   - On Friday, he watched a 2-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
   - The 30-minute show is 0.5 hours.
   - Total for Friday = 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 hours.

3. **Calculate the hours watched on Saturday:**
   - On Saturday, he watched three 4-hour episodes.
   - Total for Saturday = 3 * 4 = 12 hours.

4. **Add the hours watched from Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday:**
   - Total hours from Tuesday and Wednesday = 12 hours.
   - Total hours from Friday = 2.5 hours.
   - Total hours from Saturday = 12 hours.
   - Total hours watched so far = 12 + 2.5 + 12 = 26.5 hours.

5. **Calculate the remaining hours to reach the total of 29 hours:**
   - Total hours watched = 29 hours.
   - Hours accounted for = 26.5 hours.
   - Remaining hours = 29 - 26.5 = 2.5 hours.

If she used a total of 77 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.",53.0,"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables based on the given ratio of sugar to water, which is 53:24. 

Let:
- \( x \) be the common multiplier for the ratio.

Then, the amount of sugar used can be expressed as:
\[
\text{sugar} = 53x
\]
And the amount of water used can be expressed as:
\[
\text{water} = 24x

According to the problem, the total amount of sugar and water used is 77 teaspoons:
\[
53x + 24x = 77

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 77:
\[
x = 1

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,25.0,"To solve the problem, we need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. 

   - Count of numbers greater than 3: 3 (which are 4, 5, and 6)
   - Total possible outcomes when rolling a die: 6

   The probability \( P(\text{greater than 3}) \) is given by:
   \[
   P(\text{greater than 3}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. 

   - Count of even numbers: 3 (which are 2, 4, and 6)
   - Total possible outcomes when rolling a die: 6

   The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is:
   \[
   P(\text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

   Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
   \[
   P(\text{two evens}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   Now we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Difference in probabilities} = P(\text{greater than 3}) - P(\text{two evens}) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4}

   To perform the subtraction, we need a common denominator:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4}

   Thus,
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}

   To express the difference in probabilities as a percentage, we convert \(\frac{1}{4}\) to a percentage:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \quad \text{(as a decimal)}

   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \).

2. **Determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \).
   - The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \).
   - Since the rolls are independent, we multiply the probabilities: 
     \[
     \text{Probability of two even numbers} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}.

3. **Calculate how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.**
   - We have the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 as \( \frac{1}{2} \) and the probability of rolling two even numbers as \( \frac{1}{4} \).
   - To find how much more likely it is, we subtract the two probabilities:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}.

1. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   The brokerage fee is 6% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.06 \times \text{Selling Price} = 0.06 \times 410000

4. The cost to ride the roller coaster is $11 per ride, and Sofia wants to ride it 8 times.

First, let's calculate the total cost for one person (Sofia) to play laser tag, have pinball tokens, and ride the roller coaster:

- Cost for laser tag: $6
- Cost for pinball tokens: $6
- Cost for roller coaster rides: 8 rides * $11 = $88

Now, let's add these costs together for one person:

Total cost for one person = Cost for laser tag + Cost for pinball tokens + Cost for roller coaster rides
Total cost for one person = $6 + $6 + $88 = $100

Now, we need to determine how many friends Sofia can invite with the remaining budget after accounting for her own expenses:

- Total budget: $200
- Cost for Sofia: $100
- Remaining budget for friends = Total budget - Cost for Sofia
Remaining budget for friends = $200 - $100 = $100

Now, we need to find out how many friends can be invited with the remaining budget. Each friend will have the same total cost as Sofia, which is $100.

She also bought a mixed bag of sand dollars for ¥11.5 and 17 postcards that were ¥20.5 each. How much money does Sofia have left?",427.0,"To find out how much money Sofia has left after her purchases, we need to calculate the total cost of the fudge, the mixed bag of sand dollars, and the postcards.

1. **Cost of Fudge:**
   - Sofia buys 23 kgs of fudge.
   - The offer is ""Buy 16 kgs at ¥21 per kg, get 5 kgs 2/3 off.""
   - First, calculate the cost for the first 16 kgs:
     \[
     16 \text{ kgs} \times ¥21/\text{kg} = ¥336
     \]
   - Now, for the additional 5 kgs, we need to calculate the price after the discount:
     - The price per kg is ¥21.
     - The discount is 2/3 off, which means she pays 1/3 of the price.
     - The cost for 5 kgs at 1/3 of the price:
     \[
     \text{Cost for 5 kgs} = 5 \text{ kgs} \times \left(¥21 \times \frac{1}{3}\right) = 5 \text{ kgs} \times ¥7 = ¥35
     \]
   - Now, add the costs together:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of fudge} = ¥336 + ¥35 = ¥371
     \]

2. **Cost of Mixed Bag of Sand Dollars:**
   - The cost is ¥11.5.

3. **Cost of Postcards:**
   - Sofia buys 17 postcards at ¥20.5 each:
     \[
     17 \text{ postcards} \times ¥20.5/\text{postcard} = ¥348.5
     \]

4. **Total Cost of All Purchases:**
   - Now, we add the costs of fudge, sand dollars, and postcards:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = ¥371 + ¥11.5 + ¥348.5
     \]
   - Calculate the total:
     \[
     ¥371 + ¥11.5 = ¥382.5
     \]
     \[
     ¥382.5 + ¥348.5 = ¥731

5. **Money Left:**
   - Sofia started with ¥1200. Now we subtract the total cost from this amount:
     \[
     \text{Money left} = ¥1200 - ¥731 = ¥469
     \]

Thus, Sofia has ¥469 left after her purchases.",469.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Initial Amount**: Sofia starts with ¥1200.

2. **Cost of Fudge**:
   - The price for 16 kgs of fudge is ¥21 per kg.
   - So, the cost for 16 kgs is 16 * 21 = ¥336.
   - She gets 5 kgs at 2/3 off. The price for 5 kgs at ¥21 per kg is 5 * 21 = ¥105.
   - The discount on 5 kgs is 2/3 of ¥105, which is (2/3) * 105 = ¥70.
   - Therefore, the cost for 5 kgs after the discount is ¥105 - ¥70 = ¥35.
   - Now, the total cost for 21 kgs of fudge (16 kgs + 5 kgs) is ¥336 + ¥35 = ¥371.

3. **Cost of Mixed Bag of Sand Dollars**: 
   - The mixed bag costs ¥11.5.

4. **Cost of Postcards**:
   - Each postcard costs ¥20.5, and she buys 17 postcards.
   - So, the total cost for postcards is 17 * 20.5 = ¥348.5.

5. **Total Spending**:
   - Now, we add up all her expenses:
   - Total cost = Cost of fudge + Cost of sand dollars + Cost of postcards
   - Total cost = ¥371 + ¥11.5 + ¥348.5 = ¥731.

6. **Money Left**:

1. **Convert the total amount spent into cents**: 
   Liam spent ₣1000, which is equivalent to 1000 cents.

2. **Calculate the amount of money left after spending**: 
   Liam had 8% of his money left in change. 
   \[
   \text{Amount left} = 0.08 \times 1000 = 80 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount Liam spent**: 
   To find out how much Liam spent, we subtract the amount left from the total amount he had:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent} = 1000 - 80 = 920 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the popcorn**: 
   Liam bought 4 bags of popcorn, and each bag costs 25 cents. 
   \[
   \text{Cost of popcorn} = 4 \times 25 = 100 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Calculate the amount spent on pretzels**: 
   Since Liam spent a total of 920 cents, we can find out how much he spent on pretzels by subtracting the cost of popcorn from the total amount spent:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on pretzels} = 920 - 100 = 820 \text{ cents}
   \]

6. **Calculate the number of pretzels bought**: 
   Each pretzel costs 100 cents. To find out how many pretzels Liam bought, we divide the amount spent on pretzels by the cost of one pretzel:
   \[
   \text{Number of pretzels} = \frac{820}{100} = 8.2
   \]

Since Liam cannot buy a fraction of a pretzel, we need to check our calculations. 

Let's summarize:
- Total spent: 920 cents
- Cost of popcorn: 100 cents
- Amount spent on pretzels: 820 cents
- Number of pretzels: 8.2 (which is not possible)

This indicates that there might be a misunderstanding in the problem or the calculations. 

However, if we consider that he could only buy whole pretzels, he must have bought 8 pretzels, which would cost:
\[
8 \times 100 = 800 \text{ cents}
\]
This would leave him with:
\[
920 - 800 - 100 = 20 \text{ cents}
\]
This does not match the 80 cents left.

Let's re-evaluate the calculations:
- Total spent: 920 cents
- Cost of popcorn: 100 cents
- Amount spent on pretzels: 820 cents
- Number of pretzels: 8 (which costs 800 cents)

Thus, the correct answer is that Liam bought **8 pretzels**.",8.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Liam spent a total of ₣1000.

   4 \text{ bags} \times 25 \text{ cents/bag} = 100 \text{ cents} = ₣1.00
   \]
4. After buying the popcorn, the amount of money he has left is:
   \[
   ₣1000 - ₣1.00 = ₣999.00
   \]
5. Liam had 8% of his money left in change. To find out how much that is, we calculate 8% of ₣1000:
   \[
   0.08 \times 1000 = ₣80
   \]
6. Therefore, the amount of money Liam spent on pretzels is:
   \[
   ₣999.00 - ₣80 = ₣919.00

What is the total weekly production for the two if they work all days of the week?",5355.0,"To find the total weekly production for Mia and Gabrielle, we first need to determine how many customers Mia processes in a day.

1. **Determine Gabrielle's daily production:**
   Gabrielle processes 85 customers per day.

2. **Determine Mia's processing speed:**
   Mia operates 8 times as fast as Gabrielle. Therefore, if Gabrielle processes 85 customers in a day, Mia processes:
   \[
   \text{Mia's daily production} = 8 \times \text{Gabrielle's daily production} = 8 \times 85 = 680 \text{ customers}

How much did he pay?,120.0,"To determine how much Theo paid for the party bus, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Time Hired**: Theo hires the bus from 3 PM to 8 PM, which is a total of:
   \[
   8 \text{ PM} - 3 \text{ PM} = 5 \text{ hours}

He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 40% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of tea and he uses 2 kilogram of tea per day. He also decided to buy himself a cookie for ₣2. How much did everything cost?,296.0,"To find out how much James spent in total, we can break down the problem into a few steps.

1. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive tea:**
   - The normal brand costs ₣15 per kilogram.
   - The more expensive brand costs 40% more than the normal brand.
   - To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we calculate 40% of ₣15:
     \[
     40\% \text{ of } 15 = 0.40 \times 15 = ₣6
     \]
   - Now, we add this to the normal price to find the price of the more expensive brand:
     \[
     15 + 6 = ₣21 \text{ per kilogram}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of tea James needs for a week:**
   - James uses 2 kilograms of tea per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he will need:
     \[
     2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ kg}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the tea:**
   - Now we multiply the cost of the more expensive tea by the total kilograms needed:
     \[
     14 \text{ kg} \times ₣21/\text{kg} = ₣294
     \]

4. **Add the cost of the cookie:**
   - The cookie costs ₣2, so we add this to the total cost of the tea:
     \[
     294 + 2 = ₣296
     \]

5. **Final total cost:**
   - Therefore, the total cost for the tea and the cookie is:

- \( k_F \) = number of boxes of kiwi pies sold on Friday

From the problem, we know:
- \( b_F = 29 \)
- \( k_F = b_S - 12 \) (where \( b_S \) is the number of boxes of brownies sold on Saturday)

### Step 2: Determine the number of boxes sold on Saturday

Let:
- \( b_S \) = number of boxes of brownies sold on Saturday

  \text{Earnings from kiwi pies} = k_F \times \text{cost of kiwi pie} = 28 \times 27 = 756
  \]
- Total earnings on Friday:
  \[
  \text{Total earnings on Friday} = 319 + 756 = 1075
  \]

**Earnings on Saturday:**
- Earnings from brownies: 
  \[
  \text{Earnings from brownies} = b_S \times \text{cost of brownie} = 40 \times 11 = 440

- Total earnings on Saturday:
  \[
  \text{Total earnings on Saturday} = 440 + 702 = 1142
  \]

### Step 5: Calculate total earnings for both days

Finally, we add the total earnings from both days:
\[
\text{Total earnings for two days} = \text{Total earnings on Friday} + \text{Total earnings on Saturday} = 1075 + 1142 = 2217
\]

### Conclusion

Oscar earned a total of ¥2217 for the two days.",2217.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. On Friday, Oscar sold 29 boxes of brownie.
2. He sold 12 fewer boxes of kiwi pie than on Saturday. 
3. On Saturday, he sold 11 more boxes of brownies than on Friday. So, on Saturday, he sold:
   - 29 (Friday's brownies) + 11 = 40 boxes of brownie.
4. On Saturday, he sold 26 boxes of kiwi pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day.

**Friday:**
- Earnings from brownies:
  - 29 boxes * ¥11 = ¥319.
- Earnings from kiwi pie:
  - Since he sold 12 fewer boxes of kiwi pie than on Saturday, he sold:
    - 26 (Saturday's kiwi pie) - 12 = 14 boxes of kiwi pie.
  - 14 boxes * ¥27 = ¥378.
- Total earnings on Friday:
  - ¥319 (brownies) + ¥378 (kiwi pie) = ¥697.

**Saturday:**
- Earnings from brownies:
  - 40 boxes * ¥11 = ¥440.
- Earnings from kiwi pie:
  - 26 boxes * ¥27 = ¥702.
- Total earnings on Saturday:
  - ¥440 (brownies) + ¥702 (kiwi pie) = ¥1,142.

Now, let's find the total earnings for both days:
- Total earnings = Friday's earnings + Saturday's earnings
- Total earnings = ¥697 + ¥1,142 = ¥1,839.

The answer is ¥1,839.",1839.0,1,,1839.0,1

Each flowering plant costs ¥3 at the store, how much money will Kimia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",3.0,"To determine how much money Kimia will spend at the store to fill her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total space each flower occupies**: Each flower is 3 feet wide, and there is a 15-foot gap between each flower. Therefore, the total space occupied by one flower and the gap is:
   \[
   \text{Total space per flower} = \text{Width of flower} + \text{Gap} = 3 \text{ feet} + 15 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet}

How long will it take her to peel and saute 90 clams?,30.0,"To find out how long it will take Fatima to peel and saute 90 clams, we need to calculate the time required for each task separately and then sum them up.

1. **Peeling the clams:**
   - Fatima can peel 10 clams per minute.
   - To find out how long it takes to peel 90 clams, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Number of clams}}{\text{Clams per minute}} = \frac{90 \text{ clams}}{10 \text{ clams/minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sauteing the clams:**
   - Fatima can saute 30 clams in 7 minutes.
   - First, we find out how long it takes to saute 1 clam:
     \[
     \text{Time to saute 1 clam} = \frac{7 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ clams}} = \frac{7}{30} \text{ minutes per clam}

3. **Total time:**
   - Now we add the time to peel and the time to saute:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to saute} = 9 \text{ minutes} + 21 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}

Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. How old was Viktor when he saw the Comet for the first time?,14.0,"Let's denote the age of Viktor's father when he first saw the comet as \( F \) and the age of Viktor when he first saw the comet as \( V \).

From the problem, we know that:
- Viktor's father saw the comet when he was 23 years old, so \( F = 23 \).
- Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 55 years, we can calculate the time that has passed since Viktor's father first saw the comet until Viktor saw it the second time.

Let \( x \) be the number of years that passed from the time Viktor's father saw the comet until Viktor saw it the second time. Therefore, Viktor's father is now \( 23 + x \) years old, and Viktor is \( V + x \) years old.

According to the problem, Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he first saw the comet. This means:

\[
V + x = 3 \cdot 23
\]

Calculating \( 3 \cdot 23 \):

\[
3 \cdot 23 = 69
\]

So we have:

\[
V + x = 69
\]

Now, we also know that the comet appears every 55 years, so the time that has passed since Viktor's father first saw the comet is \( x = 55 \) years.

Substituting \( x = 55 \) into the equation \( V + x = 69 \):

\[
V + 55 = 69
\]

Now, we can solve for \( V \):

\[
V = 69 - 55

\[
V = 14

1. Viktor's father saw the comet when he was 23 years old.
2. The comet orbits the sun every 55 years, so it will be seen again 55 years after the first sighting.

4. Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw it the first time. 
5. Viktor's father's age when he saw the comet the first time was 23 years. Therefore, three times that age is 3 * 23 = 69 years.
6. Since Viktor saw the comet when his father was 78 years old, we need to find out how many years passed between the first sighting and the second sighting: 78 - 23 = 55 years.
7. Viktor was 69 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

1. One troll can mine 5 kgs of ore per day with bare hands.
2. With a nickel pickaxe, he can mine twice as much:
   - So, with a nickel pickaxe, he can mine 5 * 2 = 10 kgs of ore per day.
3. With a titanium pickaxe, he can mine 30% more than with a nickel pickaxe:
   - 30% of 10 kgs is 10 * 0.30 = 3 kgs.
   - Therefore, with a titanium pickaxe, he can mine 10 + 3 = 13 kgs of ore per day.
4. Now, we need to find out how much 20 trolls can mine in one day with titanium pickaxes:
   - So, 20 trolls can mine 20 * 13 = 260 kgs of ore in one day.
5. Finally, we calculate how much they can mine in a month with 31 days:
   - In 31 days, they can mine 260 * 31 = 8060 kgs of ore.

According to the problem, Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, so we can express the amount of fence Kimia gets as \( R + 30 \) yards.

The total amount of fence they have is 900 yards. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
R + (R + 30) = 900
\]

Now, let's simplify the equation:

\[
2R + 30 = 900
\]

Next, we will subtract 30 from both sides:

\[
2R = 900 - 30

\[
2R = 870

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( R \):

\[
R = \frac{870}{2} = 435

So, Rania gets 435 yards of fence. 

To find out how much Kimia gets, we can substitute \( R \) back into the expression for Kimia's amount:

\[
K = R + 30 = 435 + 30 = 465

Now, we can check the total:

\[
R + K = 435 + 465 = 900

Let Rania's share of the fence be represented as \( R \) yards.  
Since Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, we can represent Kimia's share as \( R + 30 \) yards.  

Together, they have a total of 900 yards of fence. Therefore, we can set up the equation:  
\[ R + (R + 30) = 900 \]  

Now, let's simplify the equation:  
\[ 2R + 30 = 900 \]  

Next, we subtract 30 from both sides:

\[ R = \frac{870}{2} = 435 \]  

So, Rania gets 435 yards of fence.  
Now, let's find out how much Kimia gets:  
\[ K = R + 30 = 435 + 30 = 465 \]  

Finally, we can check how much is left over for Rania:  
Since they split the total of 900 yards, and Rania has 435 yards, there is no leftover fence.

\[ R + (R + 30) = 900 \]

Now, let's simplify the equation:
\[ 2R + 30 = 900 \]

Next, we subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 2R = 900 - 30 \]
\[ 2R = 870 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to find Rania's share:
\[ R = \frac{870}{2} = 435 \]

So, Rania gets 435 yards of fence. 

Now, we can find Kimia's share:
\[ K = R + 30 = 435 + 30 = 465 \]

To find out how much is left over for Rania, we check the total:
Rania has 435 yards and Kimia has 465 yards, which adds up to:
\[ 435 + 465 = 900 \]

Since they split the fence according to the agreement, there is no leftover fence.

How many hours a week does he spend learning?,42.0,"To find out how many hours a week Hiroshi spends learning, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total class time during the week:**
   - Hiroshi has 7 periods in a day, plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of \(7 + 2 = 9\) periods per day.
   - Each class is 35 minutes long, so the total time spent in classes per day is:
     \[
     9 \text{ periods} \times 35 \text{ minutes/period} = 315 \text{ minutes/day}

2. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - Hiroshi spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. First, we need to find three-sixths of his total weekly class time:
     \[
     \text{Three-sixths of 1260 minutes} = \frac{3}{6} \times 1260 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1260 = 630 \text{ minutes}

2. **Calculate the distance walked on the beach:**
   The distance Emma walks on the beach is 11 miles.

3. **Calculate her speed on the beach:**
   Speed is calculated as distance divided by time. Therefore, her speed on the beach is:
   \[
   \text{Speed on beach} = \frac{\text{Distance on beach}}{\text{Time on beach}} = \frac{11 \text{ miles}}{66 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{11}{66} \text{ miles per minute} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ miles per minute}
   \]

4. **Determine her speed on the sidewalk:**
   Emma walks at four times the speed on the beach on the sidewalk. Thus, her speed on the sidewalk is:
   \[
   \text{Speed on sidewalk} = 4 \times \frac{1}{6} \text{ miles per minute} = \frac{4}{6} \text{ miles per minute} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ miles per minute}
   \]

5. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   The distance Emma walks on the sidewalk is 16 miles. We can find the time spent walking on the sidewalk using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on sidewalk}} = \frac{16 \text{ miles}}{\frac{2}{3} \text{ miles per minute}} = 16 \times \frac{3}{2} = 24 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   The total time spent walking is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 66 \text{ minutes} + 24 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Emma to complete her entire 27-mile walk is \(\boxed{90}\) minutes.",90.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Emma walks a total of 27 miles every day.
2. She walks 11 miles on the beach and 16 miles on the sidewalk.
3. We know that she spends 66 minutes walking on the beach.

Next, we need to find out how fast she walks on the beach and then use that to find her speed on the sidewalk.

4. To find her speed on the beach, we can calculate it as follows:
   - Speed on the beach = Distance on the beach / Time on the beach
   - Speed on the beach = 11 miles / (66 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) = 11 miles / 1.1 hours = 10 miles per hour.

5. Since she walks on the sidewalk at four times the speed of her beach walking, her speed on the sidewalk is:
   - Speed on the sidewalk = 4 * Speed on the beach = 4 * 10 miles per hour = 40 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk the 16 miles on the sidewalk.

6. Time taken to walk on the sidewalk = Distance on the sidewalk / Speed on the sidewalk
   - Time on the sidewalk = 16 miles / 40 miles per hour = 0.4 hours.

7. To convert this time into minutes:
   - Time on the sidewalk in minutes = 0.4 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 24 minutes.

Finally, we can find the total time for her entire walk.

8. Total time for the entire 27-mile walk = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk
   - Total time = 66 minutes + 24 minutes = 90 minutes.

The answer is 90 minutes.",90.0,1,,90.0,1

3/6 * 96 = 1/2 * 96 = 48.  
So, he drops 48 marbles.  
Now, we subtract the dropped marbles from the total:  
96 - 48 = 48.  
He then finds 18 of the dropped marbles.  
So, now he has:  
48 + 18 = 66 marbles.  
However, he finds that 2 of these are actually beads, so he gets rid of them.  
Now, we subtract the beads from the total:  
66 - 2 = 64.

As the pot of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 30 pop in the first 22 seconds of cooking, then 2 times that amount in the next 22 seconds. The kernels increase to 4 times the initial popping rate in the next 22 seconds, but in the final 22 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 22 seconds. After Oscar takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Oscar have to eat?",285.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First 22 seconds**: 
   - Number of pops = 30

2. **Next 22 seconds**: 
   - Number of pops = 2 times the amount from the first 22 seconds
   - Number of pops = 2 * 30 = 60

3. **Next 22 seconds**: 
   - Number of pops = 4 times the amount from the first 22 seconds
   - Number of pops = 4 * 30 = 120

4. **Final 22 seconds**: 
   - Number of pops = half the rate of the previous 22 seconds
   - Previous 22 seconds had 120 pops, so:
   - Number of pops = 120 / 2 = 60

Now, let's sum up the total number of pops during the cooking time:

- Total pops = 30 (first 22 seconds) + 60 (next 22 seconds) + 120 (next 22 seconds) + 60 (final 22 seconds)
- Total pops = 30 + 60 + 120 + 60 = 270

5. **Residual heat**: 
   - A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds also pop.
   - Number of pops in the final 22 seconds = 60
   - Residual pops = 1/4 * 60 = 15

6. **Total pieces of popcorn**:
   - Total pieces of popcorn = Total pops during cooking + Residual pops
   - Total pieces of popcorn = 270 + 15 = 285

Thus, Oscar has **285 pieces of popcorn** to eat.",285.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. In the first 22 seconds, 30 kernels pop.
2. In the next 22 seconds, the amount that pops is 2 times the first amount:
   - So, 2 * 30 = 60 kernels pop.
3. In the following 22 seconds, the popping rate increases to 4 times the initial rate:
   - So, 4 * 30 = 120 kernels pop.
4. In the final 22 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate of the previous 22 seconds:
   - So, half of 120 = 60 kernels pop.
5. Now, let's calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the cooking:
   - Total = 30 (first 22 seconds) + 60 (second 22 seconds) + 120 (third 22 seconds) + 60 (final 22 seconds)
   - Total = 30 + 60 + 120 + 60 = 270 kernels.
6. After Oscar takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds also pop from the residual heat:
   - A quarter of the final 22 seconds' popping (which was 60 kernels) is 60 / 4 = 15 kernels.
7. Finally, we add the kernels that popped from the residual heat to the total:
   - Total popcorn = 270 + 15 = 285 kernels.

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"A stack is made out of 4 purple tiles, twice as many pink tiles, and an unknown number of green tiles. If there are 30 tiles in the stack in total, how many green tiles are there?",18.0,"To find the number of green tiles, we can start by determining the number of pink tiles based on the information given.

1. **Identify the number of purple tiles**: 
   - There are 4 purple tiles.

2. **Determine the number of pink tiles**: 
   - The problem states that there are twice as many pink tiles as purple tiles. Therefore, the number of pink tiles is:
   \[
   \text{Number of pink tiles} = 2 \times \text{Number of purple tiles} = 2 \times 4 = 8
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of tiles accounted for**: 
   - Now we can add the number of purple and pink tiles:
   \[
   \text{Total number of purple and pink tiles} = \text{Number of purple tiles} + \text{Number of pink tiles} = 4 + 8 = 12
   \]

4. **Set up the equation for the total number of tiles**: 
   - We know the total number of tiles in the stack is 30. Let \( g \) represent the number of green tiles. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   \text{Total tiles} = \text{Number of purple tiles} + \text{Number of pink tiles} + \text{Number of green tiles}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   30 = 4 + 8 + g
   \]

5. **Solve for \( g \)**:
   \[
   30 = 12 + g
   \]
   To isolate \( g \), subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[
   g = 30 - 12 = 18

Thus, the number of green tiles is \( \boxed{18} \).",18.0,1,"Let's think step by step.  
The stack has 4 purple tiles.  
It has twice as many pink tiles, so the number of pink tiles is 2 * 4 = 8.

4 (purple) + 8 (pink) = 12 tiles.  
The total number of tiles in the stack is 30.  
To find the number of green tiles, we subtract the number of purple and pink tiles from the total:  
30 (total tiles) - 12 (purple and pink tiles) = 18 green tiles.

He also has his 2 young children who weigh 75 pounds each in it. If the force to move the car is 4% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the car?",92.0,"To find the total weight of Pavel's car, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the weight of the children.

1. **Weight of the car**: 1700 pounds
2. **Weight of the luggage**: 450 pounds
3. **Weight of the children**: 2 children × 75 pounds/child = 150 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total weight:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of the car} + \text{Weight of the luggage} + \text{Weight of the children}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight} = 1700 + 450 + 150 = 2300 \text{ pounds}

Next, we need to calculate the force required to move the car, which is 4% of the total weight.

To find 4% of the total weight, we can use the following formula:

\[
\text{Force} = 0.04 \times \text{Total weight}
\]

Substituting the total weight we calculated:

\[
\text{Force} = 0.04 \times 2300

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Force} = 92 \text{ pounds}

Therefore, the force Pavel needs to push the car is **92 pounds**.",92.0,1,"Let's think step by step.  
First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children.  
The weight of the car is 1700 pounds.  
The weight of the luggage is 450 pounds.  
Each child weighs 75 pounds, and there are 2 children, so their total weight is 75 * 2 = 150 pounds.  

Now, we can add these weights together:  
Total weight = weight of the car + weight of the luggage + weight of the children  
Total weight = 1700 + 450 + 150 = 2300 pounds.  

Next, we need to find out how much force is needed to move the car, which is 4% of the total weight.  
To find 4% of the total weight, we can calculate:  
Force = 4% of total weight = 0.04 * 2300.
