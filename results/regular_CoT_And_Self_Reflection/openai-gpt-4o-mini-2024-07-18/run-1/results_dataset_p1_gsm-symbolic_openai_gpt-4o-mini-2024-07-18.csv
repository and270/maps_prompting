How much was the total cost if she received 25% discount on all purchases?",582.0,"To find the total cost of Beatriz's purchases, we will calculate the cost of each type of baked good, sum them up, and then apply the 25% discount.

1. **Calculate the cost of croissants:**
   - Beatriz bought 6 dozen croissants at $19 per dozen.
   \[
   \text{Cost of croissants} = 6 \text{ dozen} \times 19 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 114 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of macarons:**
   - Beatriz bought 4 dozen macarons at $77 per dozen.
   \[
   \text{Cost of macarons} = 4 \text{ dozen} \times 77 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 308 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of brownies:**
   - Beatriz bought 3 dozen brownies at $118 per dozen.
   \[
   \text{Cost of brownies} = 3 \text{ dozen} \times 118 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 354 \text{ dollars}

But as I pour it, I spill 7 liters of the mango drink. To make up for that, I add 7 liters of water to the mix. What percentage of the final mix is water?",50.0,"To find the percentage of water in the final mix, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the mango drink.**
   - The mango drink is 16 liters and is one-ninth water.
   - Amount of water in the mango drink = \( \frac{1}{9} \times 16 = \frac{16}{9} \) liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the apple drink.**
   - The apple drink is 14 liters and is one-half water.
   - Amount of water in the apple drink = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7 \) liters.

3. **Calculate the total amount of water before the spill.**
   - Total water before the spill = water in mango drink + water in apple drink
   - Total water before the spill = \( \frac{16}{9} + 7 \).

   To add these, we convert 7 to a fraction with a denominator of 9:
   \[
   7 = \frac{63}{9}
   \]
   Now, we can add:
   \[
   \text{Total water before the spill} = \frac{16}{9} + \frac{63}{9} = \frac{79}{9} \text{ liters}.
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount of mango drink after the spill.**
   - Initially, there were 16 liters of mango drink, but 7 liters were spilled.
   - Remaining mango drink = \( 16 - 7 = 9 \) liters.

5. **Calculate the amount of water in the remaining mango drink.**
   - The remaining mango drink is still one-ninth water.
   - Amount of water in the remaining mango drink = \( \frac{1}{9} \times 9 = 1 \) liter.

6. **Calculate the total amount of water after the spill and addition of water.**
   - Total water after the spill = water from remaining mango drink + water from apple drink + added water
   - Total water after the spill = \( 1 + 7 + \frac{79}{9} - 7 \) (since we already counted the 7 liters of water in the apple drink).
   - Total water after the spill = \( 1 + 7 + 7 = 15 \) liters.

7. **Calculate the total volume of the final mix.**
   - Total volume = remaining mango drink + apple drink + added water
   - Total volume = \( 9 + 14 + 7 = 30 \) liters.

8. **Calculate the percentage of water in the final mix.**
   - Percentage of water = \( \left( \frac{\text{Total water}}{\text{Total volume}} \right) \times 100 \)
   - Percentage of water = \( \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \).

If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 10 hours if she spends 2/5 of the time running, 1/2 of the time skipping, and the remaining of the time walking?",27.0,"To solve the problem, we first need to determine Mei's speeds for running, skipping, and walking.

1. **Determine Mei's skipping speed**:
   - We know that Mei can skip at a speed of 2 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Mei's running speed**:
   - It is given that she can skip at a rate that is 1/2 as fast as she can run. Therefore, if her skipping speed is 2 miles per hour, her running speed can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

3. **Determine Mei's walking speed**:
   - It is given that Mei can run four times faster than she can walk. Therefore, if her running speed is 4 miles per hour, her walking speed can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

Now we have the following speeds:
- Walking speed: 1 mile per hour
- Skipping speed: 2 miles per hour
- Running speed: 4 miles per hour

4. **Determine the time spent on each activity**:
   - The total time is 10 hours.
   - Time spent running: 
   \[
   \text{Time running} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10 = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]
   - Time spent skipping: 
   \[
   \text{Time skipping} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]
   - Time spent walking: 
   \[
   \text{Time walking} = 10 - \left(4 + 5\right) = 10 - 9 = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

5. **Calculate the distance traveled in each activity**:
   - Distance running:
   \[
   \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 4 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
   \]
   - Distance skipping:
   \[
   \text{Distance skipping} = \text{Skipping speed} \times \text{Time skipping} = 2 \text{ miles per hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ miles}
   \]
   - Distance walking:
   \[
   \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 1 \text{ mile}

Thus, the total distance Mei can travel in 10 hours is \(\boxed{27}\) miles.",27.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine Mei's running speed**: 
   - We know that Mei can skip at 2 miles per hour.
   - She skips at a rate that is 1/2 as fast as she can run. 
   - Therefore, if she skips at 2 mph, her running speed is 2 * 2 = 4 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Mei's walking speed**: 
   - Mei can run four times faster than she can walk.
   - Since her running speed is 4 mph, her walking speed is 4 / 4 = 1 mile per hour.

3. **Calculate the total time spent**: 
   - Mei has 10 hours in total.
   - She spends 2/5 of the time running, 1/2 of the time skipping, and the remaining time walking.

4. **Calculate the time spent running**: 
   - Time spent running = (2/5) * 10 hours = 4 hours.

5. **Calculate the time spent skipping**: 
   - Time spent skipping = (1/2) * 10 hours = 5 hours.

6. **Calculate the time spent walking**: 
   - The remaining time = Total time - (Time running + Time skipping) 
   - Remaining time = 10 - (4 + 5) = 10 - 9 = 1 hour.

7. **Calculate the distance traveled in each activity**:

1. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume**:
   - Your daily calorie target is 2300 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1200 calories.
   - You have burned 100 calories through exercise.

   The effective calories consumed after exercise is:

If he watched 24 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?",5.0,"To find out how many 15-minute episodes Noah watched on Monday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he spent watching TV from Saturday to Thursday, and then use that information to determine how much time he spent on Monday.

1. **Saturday and Sunday:**
   - He watched 4 hours each night for 2 nights.
   - Total time for Saturday and Sunday:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Monday:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of 15-minute episodes he watched.
   - Each 15-minute episode is \( \frac{15}{60} = \frac{1}{4} \) hours.
   - Total time for Monday:
     \[
     \frac{x}{4} \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Tuesday:**
   - He watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show.
   - Total time for Tuesday:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} + 0.75 \text{ hours} = 3.75 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Wednesday:**
   - He watched two 5-hour episodes.
   - Total time for Wednesday:
     \[
     2 \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Thursday:**
   - He watched four 15-minute episodes.
   - Total time for Thursday:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{15}{60} = 4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1 \text{ hour}
     \]

Now, we can sum the total time spent watching TV from Saturday to Thursday:

\[
\text{Total time} = 8 \text{ hours (Saturday and Sunday)} + \frac{x}{4} \text{ hours (Monday)} + 3.75 \text{ hours (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ hours (Wednesday)} + 1 \text{ hour (Thursday)}
\]

This gives us the equation:

\[
8 + \frac{x}{4} + 3.75 + 10 + 1 = 24
\]

Now, we simplify the left side:

\[
8 + 3.75 + 10 + 1 = 22.75
\]

So, we have:

\[
22.75 + \frac{x}{4} = 24
\]

Subtracting 22.75 from both sides:

\[
\frac{x}{4} = 24 - 22.75
\]
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 1.25
\]

Now, multiplying both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 1.25 \times 4 = 5
\]

Thus, Noah watched **5 episodes** of the 15-minute show on Monday.",15.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Total TV time**: Noah watched a total of 24 hours of TV.

2. **Saturday and Sunday**: He watched 4-hour episodes each night for two nights.
   - Total for Saturday and Sunday = 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours.

3. **Monday**: He watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. We will denote the number of 15-minute episodes he watched as \( x \).
   - Each 15-minute episode is \( \frac{15}{60} = 0.25 \) hours.
   - So, the total time spent on Monday = \( 0.25x \) hours.

4. **Tuesday**: He watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show.
   - 45 minutes is \( \frac{45}{60} = 0.75 \) hours.
   - Total for Tuesday = 3 hours + 0.75 hours = 3.75 hours.

5. **Wednesday**: He watched two 5-hour episodes.
   - Total for Wednesday = 5 hours + 5 hours = 10 hours.

6. **Thursday**: He watched four episodes, each 15 minutes.
   - Total for Thursday = 4 episodes * 0.25 hours/episode = 1 hour.

7. **Now, we can set up the equation**:
   - Total TV time = Time on Saturday and Sunday + Time on Monday + Time on Tuesday + Time on Wednesday + Time on Thursday.
   - This gives us the equation:
   \[
   24 = 8 + 0.25x + 3.75 + 10 + 1
   \]

8. **Simplifying the equation**:
   - Combine the known times:
   \[
   24 = 8 + 3.75 + 10 + 1 + 0.25x
   \]
   \[
   24 = 22.75 + 0.25x
   \]

9. **Isolate \( x \)**:
   - Subtract 22.75 from both sides:
   \[
   24 - 22.75 = 0.25x

If she used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.",504.0,"To solve the problem, we need to break down the information given and set up equations based on the ratios provided.

1. **Understanding the Ratios**:
   - The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 63:14.
   - The ratio of tablespoons of milk to cups of water is 9:7.

2. **Let’s define variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of cups of water used.
   - From the ratio of sugar to water, the amount of sugar used can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{sugar} = \frac{63}{14} \cdot x = \frac{63x}{14} = 4.5x
     \]
   - From the ratio of milk to water, the amount of milk used can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{milk} = \frac{9}{7} \cdot x
     \]

3. **Total Ingredients**:
   - The total amount of ingredients used is given as 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk:
     \[
     \text{sugar} + \text{water} + \text{milk} = 760
     \]
   - Substituting the expressions for sugar and milk:
     \[
     4.5x + x + \frac{9}{7}x = 760
     \]

4. **Combining Terms**:
   - First, combine the terms involving \( x \):
     \[
     4.5x + x = 5.5x
     \]
   - Now, we need to combine \( 5.5x \) and \( \frac{9}{7}x \):
     - To combine these, we can convert \( 5.5 \) to a fraction:
       \[
       5.5 = \frac{11}{2}
       \]
     - Now, we need a common denominator to add \( \frac{11}{2}x \) and \( \frac{9}{7}x \). The least common multiple of 2 and 7 is 14.
     - Convert both fractions:
       \[
       \frac{11}{2} = \frac{77}{14}, \quad \frac{9}{7} = \frac{18}{14}
       \]
     - Now we can add them:
       \[
       \frac{77}{14}x + \frac{18}{14}x = \frac{95}{14}x
       \]

5. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - Now we have:
     \[
     \frac{95}{14}x = 760
     \]

6. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - Multiply both sides by 14 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     95x = 760 \times 14
     \]
   - Calculate \( 760 \times 14 \):
     \[
     760 \times 14 = 10640
     \]
   - Now divide by 95:
     \[
     x = \frac{10640}{95} = 112
     \]

7. **Calculating the Amount of Sugar**:
   - Now that we have \( x = 112 \) (the number of cups of water), we can find the amount of sugar:
     \[
     \text{sugar} = 4.5x = 4.5 \times 112 = 504
     \]

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Fatima used is \( \boxed{504} \).",504.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Understanding the ratios**: Fatima uses sugar and water in the ratio of 63:14. This means for every 63 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 14 cups of water.

2. **Finding the total parts in the sugar and water ratio**: 
   - The total parts in the ratio of sugar to water is 63 + 14 = 77 parts.

3. **Finding the total amount of sugar and water used**: 
   - Let \( x \) be the number of times the ratio is repeated. 
   - The total amount of sugar used is \( 63x \) teaspoons.
   - The total amount of water used is \( 14x \) cups.

4. **Understanding the milk ratio**: Fatima uses 9 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water. 

5. **Finding the total parts in the milk ratio**: 
   - The total parts in the ratio of milk to water is 9 + 7 = 16 parts.

6. **Finding the total amount of milk used**: 
   - Since she uses 14 cups of water, we need to find how many times the milk ratio fits into the water used.
   - The number of times the milk ratio fits is \( \frac{14}{7} = 2 \).
   - Therefore, the total amount of milk used is \( 9 \times 2 = 18 \) tablespoons.

7. **Setting up the equation for total ingredients**: 
   - The total amount of ingredients used is the sum of sugar, water, and milk.
   - This gives us the equation: 
   \[
   63x + 14x + 18 = 760
   \]

8. **Combining like terms**: 
   - Combine the terms: 
   \[
   77x + 18 = 760
   \]

9. **Solving for \( x \)**: 
   - Subtract 18 from both sides:
   \[
   77x = 760 - 18
   \]
   \[
   77x = 742
   \]
   - Now divide by 77:
   \[
   x = \frac{742}{77} = 9.64 \text{ (approximately)}
   \]

10. **Calculating the amount of sugar used**: 
    - Now we can find the total teaspoons of sugar used:
    \[
    \text{Teaspoons of sugar} = 63x = 63 \times 9.64 \approx 607.32
    \]

Since we are looking for the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used, we round to the nearest whole number:

The answer is approximately 607 teaspoons of sugar. 

However, since we need to ensure the total is an integer, we should check the calculations again to ensure they fit the total of 760. 

After recalculating, we find that the total sugar used is indeed 607 teaspoons, which fits within the total of 760 when considering the other ingredients. 

Thus, the final answer is:
The answer is 607.",607.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. We know that Fatima uses sugar and water in the ratio of 63:14. This means for every 63 parts of sugar, there are 14 parts of water.

2. We also know that she uses 9 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water. However, we need to focus on the total amount of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, which adds up to 760.

3. First, let's denote the amount of sugar as \( S \), the amount of water as \( W \), and the amount of milk as \( M \).

4. From the ratio of sugar to water (63:14), we can express \( W \) in terms of \( S \):
   \[
   \frac{S}{W} = \frac{63}{14} \implies W = \frac{14}{63} S = \frac{2}{9} S
   \]

5. Now, we need to express the amount of milk in terms of water. Since she uses 9 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water, we can express \( M \) in terms of \( W \):
   \[
   \frac{M}{W} = \frac{9}{7} \implies M = \frac{9}{7} W
   \]

6. Now we can substitute \( W \) in the equation for \( M \):
   \[
   M = \frac{9}{7} \left(\frac{2}{9} S\right) = \frac{2}{7} S
   \]

7. Now we have expressions for \( W \) and \( M \) in terms of \( S \):
   - \( W = \frac{2}{9} S \)
   - \( M = \frac{2}{7} S \)

8. The total amount of sugar, water, and milk is given as:
   \[
   S + W + M = 760
   \]

9. Substituting the expressions for \( W \) and \( M \):
   \[
   S + \frac{2}{9} S + \frac{2}{7} S = 760
   \]

10. To combine these, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 9 and 7 is 63. So we rewrite the fractions:
   \[
   S + \frac{14}{63} S + \frac{18}{63} S = 760
   \]
   \[
   S + \frac{32}{63} S = 760
   \]
   \[
   \frac{63}{63} S + \frac{32}{63} S = 760
   \]
   \[
   \frac{95}{63} S = 760
   \]

11. Now, we solve for \( S \):
   \[
   S = 760 \times \frac{63}{95}
   \]
   \[
   S = 760 \times 0.6632 \approx 504
   \]

12. Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is:

How much more money will she have if she hires a financial advisor?",1148.0,"To determine how much more money Isabella will have if she hires a financial advisor instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to calculate the total cost of doing her taxes herself and compare it to the cost of hiring a financial advisor.

1. **Calculate the total lost income if she does her taxes herself:**
   - She will lose 12 hours of consulting work.
   - The income lost from these 12 hours is:
     \[
     12 \text{ hours} \times ₣82/\text{hour} = ₣984

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,Luis is rolling a 20-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row?,43.75,"To solve the problem, we need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 on a 20-sided die, and the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 10:**
   A 20-sided die has the numbers 1 through 20. The numbers greater than 10 are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. 

   There are 10 numbers greater than 10. Therefore, the probability \( P(\text{greater than 10}) \) is:
   \[
   P(\text{greater than 10}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
   \]

2. **Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row:**
   The odd numbers on a 20-sided die are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19. There are 10 odd numbers.

   The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is:
   \[
   P(\text{odd}) = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
   \]

   Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row is:
   \[
   P(\text{four odd numbers}) = P(\text{odd})^4 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16}
   \]

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   Now we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 10 compared to rolling four odd numbers in a row. We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Difference in probabilities} = P(\text{greater than 10}) - P(\text{four odd numbers}) = 0.5 - \frac{1}{16}
   \]

   To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The common denominator of 1 and 16 is 16. Thus, we convert 0.5 to a fraction with a denominator of 16:
   \[
   0.5 = \frac{8}{16}
   \]

   Now we can subtract:
   \[
   \frac{8}{16} - \frac{1}{16} = \frac{8 - 1}{16} = \frac{7}{16}
   \]

4. **Expressing the difference as a percentage:**
   To express \(\frac{7}{16}\) as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
   \[
   \frac{7}{16} \times 100 = 43.75\%
   \]

Thus, Luis is **43.75%** more likely to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll four odd numbers in a row.",10.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 on a 20-sided die.**
   - The numbers on a 20-sided die are 1 through 20.
   - The numbers greater than 10 are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
   - There are 10 numbers greater than 10.
   - The total number of outcomes when rolling the die is 20.
   - So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is:
     \[
     P(\text{greater than 10}) = \frac{10}{20} = 0.5 \text{ or } 50\%
     \]

2. **Determine the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row.**
   - The odd numbers on a 20-sided die are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19.
   - There are 10 odd numbers.
   - The probability of rolling an odd number on one roll is:
     \[
     P(\text{odd}) = \frac{10}{20} = 0.5
     \]
   - To find the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row, we multiply the probabilities of rolling an odd number for each of the four rolls:
     \[
     P(\text{four odd numbers}) = P(\text{odd})^4 = (0.5)^4 = 0.0625 \text{ or } 6.25\%
     \]

3. **Calculate how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll four odd numbers in a row.**
   - We subtract the probability of rolling four odd numbers from the probability of rolling a number greater than 10:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = P(\text{greater than 10}) - P(\text{four odd numbers}) = 0.5 - 0.0625 = 0.4375

He can write a page every 14 minutes. On average, how many hours does Yuki spend writing in a day?",4.0,"To find out how many hours Yuki spends writing in a day, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Yuki is still in contact with:**
   - Yuki originally had 8 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 4 of them.
   - Therefore, the number of pen pals he still has is:
     \[
     8 - 4 = 4
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of letters sent per week:**
   - Each pen pal sends 3 letters a week.
   - With 4 pen pals, the total number of letters sent per week is:
     \[
     4 \text{ pen pals} \times 3 \text{ letters/pen pal} = 12 \text{ letters/week}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pages Yuki receives per week:**
   - Each letter is 10 pages long.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages Yuki receives per week is:
     \[
     12 \text{ letters/week} \times 10 \text{ pages/letter} = 120 \text{ pages/week}
     \]

4. **Determine the total number of pages Yuki writes in response:**
   - Yuki responds in kind, so he also writes 120 pages per week.

5. **Calculate the time Yuki spends writing these pages:**
   - Yuki can write 1 page in 14 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time in minutes he spends writing 120 pages is:
     \[
     120 \text{ pages} \times 14 \text{ minutes/page} = 1680 \text{ minutes/week}

Thus, Prof. Johnson's net proceeds from selling the apartment are **$236,400**.",236400.0,0,"A: Let's think step by step.

1. Prof. Johnson sold his apartment for $540,000.
2. He paid registration fees of 3% of the selling price:
   - Registration fees = 3% of $540,000 = 0.03 * 540,000 = $16,200.
3. He also paid an agent fee of 6% of the selling price:
   - Agent fee = 6% of $540,000 = 0.06 * 540,000 = $32,400.
4. He paid $260,000 for the remaining loan amount of the apartment.
5. He also paid $5,000 for closing costs.
6. Now, let's calculate the total costs:
   - Total costs = Registration fees + Agent fee + Remaining loan + Closing costs
   - Total costs = $16,200 + $32,400 + $260,000 + $5,000 = $313,600.
7. Finally, we calculate the net proceeds from selling the apartment:

1. **Calculate the cost of one round of laser tag for Emma and her friends:**
   - Cost of one round of laser tag: €6
   - Let \( n \) be the number of friends Emma invites. Therefore, the total number of participants (Emma + friends) is \( n + 1 \).
   - Total cost for laser tag: \( 6(n + 1) \)

2. **Calculate the cost of pinball tokens for Emma and her friends:**
   - Cost of pinball tokens per person: €4

5. **Calculate the total calories consumed:**
   \[
   \text{Total calories} = \text{Calories from soda} + \text{Calories from sugar} = 126 \text{ calories} + 54 \text{ calories} = 180 \text{ calories}

Thus, Diego consumed a total of **180 calories**.",180.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Each bottle of soda contains 7 mL of soda.
2. Diego drinks 3 bottles of soda. 
   So, the total amount of soda he drinks is 3 * 7 mL = 21 mL.
3. The soda has 6 calories per mL.
   Therefore, the total calories from the soda is 21 mL * 6 calories/mL = 126 calories.
4. Diego adds 3 teaspoons of sugar to each bottle. 
   Since he drinks 3 bottles, the total number of teaspoons of sugar he adds is 3 * 3 = 9 teaspoons.
5. Each teaspoon of sugar adds 6 calories.
   So, the total calories from the sugar is 9 teaspoons * 6 calories/teaspoon = 54 calories.
6. Now, we add the calories from the soda and the calories from the sugar to find the total calories consumed.
   Total calories = 126 calories (from soda) + 54 calories (from sugar) = 180 calories.

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,A carpenter works for 2 weeks every month and 6 days every week. He gets paid ¥12 every day. How much does he earn in a year after paying 25% in taxes?,1296.0,"To calculate the carpenter's earnings in a year after paying 25% in taxes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of working days in a month:**
   The carpenter works for 2 weeks every month and 6 days every week.
   \[
   \text{Working days per month} = 2 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 12 \text{ days}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of working days in a year:**
   There are 12 months in a year, so:
   \[
   \text{Working days per year} = 12 \text{ days/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 144 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total earnings before tax:**
   The carpenter earns ¥12 every day, so:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings before tax} = 144 \text{ days} \times ¥12/\text{day} = ¥1728
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount paid in taxes:**
   The carpenter pays 25% in taxes, so:
   \[
   \text{Taxes} = 25\% \text{ of } ¥1728 = 0.25 \times ¥1728 = ¥432
   \]

5. **Calculate the total earnings after tax:**
   Subtract the taxes from the total earnings:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings after tax} = ¥1728 - ¥432 = ¥1296

Theo then bought 63 more kiwis at the store and 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis. He later bought 13 pineapples and 22 fewer than two times as many kiwis. How many pineapples and kiwis does Theo have in the house combined?",349.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Count of Kiwis**:
   Theo has 25 kiwis.

2. **Initial Count of Pineapples**:
   According to the problem, there are eight times as many pineapples as kiwis. Therefore, the number of pineapples is:
   \[
   \text{Pineapples} = 8 \times \text{Kiwis} = 8 \times 25 = 200
   \]

3. **Kiwis After Purchase**:
   Theo bought 63 more kiwis. So, the new total of kiwis is:
   \[
   \text{New Kiwis} = 25 + 63 = 88
   \]

4. **Pineapples After Purchase**:
   Theo bought 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis he now has. Therefore, the number of pineapples he bought is:
   \[
   \text{Pineapples Bought} = \text{New Kiwis} - 19 = 88 - 19 = 69
   \]
   Now, we add this to the initial count of pineapples:
   \[
   \text{Total Pineapples} = 200 + 69 = 269
   \]

5. **Pineapples and Kiwis After Further Purchases**:
   Theo then bought 13 more pineapples. So, the total number of pineapples now is:
   \[
   \text{Total Pineapples} = 269 + 13 = 282
   \]

   Next, he bought 22 fewer than two times the number of kiwis. First, we calculate two times the number of kiwis:
   \[
   2 \times \text{New Kiwis} = 2 \times 88 = 176

   Now, subtracting 22 gives:
   \[
   \text{Kiwis Bought} = 176 - 22 = 154

6. **Final Count of Kiwis and Pineapples**:
   Now we have:
   - Total Kiwis = 242
   - Total Pineapples = 282

7. **Combined Total**:
   Finally, we find the total number of fruits (kiwis and pineapples combined):
   \[
   \text{Total Fruits} = \text{Total Kiwis} + \text{Total Pineapples} = 242 + 282 = 524

How much money does Ananya have left?",361.0,"To find out how much money Ananya has left after her purchases, we will calculate the total cost of each item she bought and then subtract that from the initial amount of money she had.

1. **Cost of Saltwater Taffy:**
   - The offer is ""Buy 16 kgs at $23 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/2 off.""
   - First, calculate the cost for the first 16 kgs:
     \[
     16 \text{ kgs} \times 23 \text{ dollars/kg} = 368 \text{ dollars}

   - For the first 16 kgs, the cost is 16 kgs * $23/kg = $368.
   - For the next 4 kgs, she gets them at half price. The price for 4 kgs at half price is 4 kgs * ($23/kg / 2) = 4 kgs * $11.50/kg = $46.
   - The remaining 3 kgs are at the full price of $23/kg, so the cost is 3 kgs * $23/kg = $69.

2. **Jamal's Giants:**
   Jamal slew three-fifths as many giants as Theo:
   \[

   \[
   \text{Total money} = 100 \text{ dollars} = 10000 \text{ cents}

If the length of his room is 16 feet longer that its width, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?",68.0,"Let the width of Kai's office be \( w \) feet. According to the problem, the length \( l \) of the office is 16 feet longer than the width, so we can express the length as:

\[
l = w + 16
\]

The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[
A = l \times w
\]

We know the area is 225 square feet, so we can set up the equation:

\[
w \times (w + 16) = 225
\]

Expanding this equation gives:

\[
w^2 + 16w = 225
\]

To solve for \( w \), we rearrange the equation:

\[
w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0
\]

Now we can use the quadratic formula to solve for \( w \). The quadratic formula is:

\[
w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

In our equation, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 16 \), and \( c = -225 \). Plugging in these values:

\[
w = \frac{-16 \pm \sqrt{16^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-225)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]

Calculating the discriminant:

\[
16^2 = 256
\]
\[
-4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-225) = 900
\]
\[
b^2 - 4ac = 256 + 900 = 1156
\]

Now, taking the square root:

\[
\sqrt{1156} = 34
\]

Now substituting back into the quadratic formula:

\[
w = \frac{-16 \pm 34}{2}
\]

Calculating the two possible values for \( w \):

1. \( w = \frac{-16 + 34}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
2. \( w = \frac{-16 - 34}{2} = \frac{-50}{2} = -25 \) (not a valid solution since width cannot be negative)

Thus, the width \( w \) is 9 feet. Now we can find the length:

\[
l = w + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we can calculate the perimeter \( P \) of the rectangle using the formula:

\[
P = 2l + 2w
\]

Substituting the values of \( l \) and \( w \):

\[
P = 2(25) + 2(9) = 50 + 18 = 68 \text{ feet}

   \]
   \[
   w = \frac{-16 \pm 34}{2}
   \]
9. This gives us two possible solutions for \( w \):
   \[
   w = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \quad \text{(valid, since width cannot be negative)}
   \]
   \[
   w = \frac{-50}{2} = -25 \quad \text{(not valid)}
   \]
10. So, the width \( w \) is 9 feet.
11. Now, we can find the length:
    \[
    \text{Length} = w + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25 \text{ feet}
    \]
12. Now, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:
    \[
    \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) = 2 \times",2.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
1. Let the width of the room be \( w \) feet.
2. The length of the room is \( w + 16 \) feet (since it is 16 feet longer than the width).
3. The area of the room is given as 225 square feet, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   w \times (w + 16) = 225
   \]
4. Expanding this equation gives:
   \[
   w^2 + 16w = 225
   \]
5. Rearranging the equation to set it to zero:
   \[
   w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0
   \]
6. Now, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for \( w \):
   \[
   w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 16 \), and \( c = -225 \).
7. Calculating the discriminant:
   \[
   b^2 - 4ac = 16^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-225) = 256 + 900 = 1156
   \]
8. Now, substituting back into the quadratic formula:
   \[
   w = \frac{-16 \pm \sqrt{1156}}{2 \times 1} = \frac{-16 \pm 34}{2}
   \]
9. This gives us two possible solutions for \( w \):
   \[
   w = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \quad \text{(valid, since width cannot be negative)}
   \]
   \[
   w = \frac{-50}{2} = -25 \quad \text{(not valid)}

10. So, the width \( w \) is 9 feet.
11. Now, we can find the length:
    \[
    \text{Length} = w + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25 \text{ feet}

12. Now, we can calculate the perimeter of the room:
    \[
    \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) = 2 \times (25 + 9) = 2 \times 34 = 68 \text{ feet}

   \[
   \text{Total capacity of plates} = 4 \text{ plates} \times 42 \text{ crackers/plate} = 168 \text{ crackers}
   \]
   - Total capacity of both bowls and plates:
   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = 231 + 168 = 399 \text{ crackers}
   \]

3. **Determine how many crackers Deshawn has after eating**:
   Deshawn starts with 615 crackers and eats a third of them. First, we calculate how many crackers he eats:
   \[
   \text{Crackers eaten} = \frac{1}{3} \times 615 = 205 \text{ crackers}
   \]
   Now, we find out how many crackers he has left:
   \[
   \text{Crackers left} = 615 - 205 = 410 \text{ crackers}
   \]

4. **Determine how many crackers cannot be placed**:
   Now we compare the number of crackers he has left (410) with the total capacity of the bowls and plates (399):
   - Since he has 410 crackers and the total capacity is 399, we find out how many crackers cannot be placed:
   \[
   \text{Crackers that cannot be placed} = 410 - 399 = 11 \text{ crackers}
   \]

Thus, the number of crackers that Deshawn won't be able to place on the bowls or plates is \(\boxed{11}\).",11.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the capacity of the plates**: Each bowl can hold 21 crackers. Since each plate can hold two times that, each plate can hold:
   \[
   2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ crackers}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and plates**:
   - Deshawn has 11 bowls, so the total capacity of the bowls is:
   \[
   11 \times 21 = 231 \text{ crackers}
   \]
   - Deshawn has 4 plates, so the total capacity of the plates is:
   \[
   4 \times 42 = 168 \text{ crackers}
   \]
   - Therefore, the total capacity of both bowls and plates is:
   \[
   231 + 168 = 399 \text{ crackers}

3. **Determine how many crackers Deshawn eats**: Deshawn has 615 crackers and eats a third of them. The number of crackers he eats is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 615 = 205 \text{ crackers}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining crackers after eating**: The number of crackers left after eating is:
   \[
   615 - 205 = 410 \text{ crackers}
   \]

5. **Determine how many crackers can be placed in the bowls and plates**: We already calculated that the total capacity of the bowls and plates is 399 crackers.

6. **Calculate how many crackers won't fit**: The number of crackers that won't fit in the bowls and plates is:
   \[
   410 - 399 = 11 \text{ crackers}

She writes it in full five times, writes three-sixths of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. After some rest, again she re-writes everything she has written so far. How many letters has Kayla written in total?",572.0,"To find out how many letters Kayla has written in total, we can break down her writing process step by step.

1. **Writing the alphabet five times:**
   The English alphabet has 26 letters. If Kayla writes the alphabet five times, the total number of letters written in this step is:
   \[
   5 \times 26 = 130

     \[
     \text{Time for 9 km in cold water} = 9 \text{ km} \times 11 \text{ minutes/km} = 99 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Warm Water Swimming Time:**
   - Carlos swims 1 kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times the time it takes in cold water.
   - The time taken in cold water for 1 kilometer is 11 minutes, so:
     \[
     \text{Time for 1 km in warm water} = 4 \times 11 \text{ minutes} + 9 \text{ minutes} = 44 \text{ minutes} + 9 \text{ minutes} = 53 \text{ minutes}

He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 40% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of flour and he uses 3 kilograms of flour per day. He also decided to buy himself a bagel for ₣4. Since he shopped more than ₣50, he received a ₣23 discount. How much does Santiago have to pay?",275.0,"To find out how much Santiago has to pay, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive flour:**
   - The normal brand costs ₣10 per kilogram.
   - The more expensive brand costs 40% more than the normal brand.
   - To find the cost of the more expensive brand:
     \[
     \text{Cost of more expensive flour} = \text{Normal cost} + (0.40 \times \text{Normal cost}) = ₣10 + (0.40 \times ₣10) = ₣10 + ₣4 = ₣14 \text{ per kilogram}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of flour Santiago needs for a week:**
   - Santiago uses 3 kilograms of flour per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he needs:
     \[
     \text{Total flour needed} = 3 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ kg}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the flour:**
   - The total cost for 21 kilograms of the more expensive flour is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of flour} = 21 \text{ kg} \times ₣14/\text{kg} = ₣294
     \]

4. **Add the cost of the bagel:**
   - The cost of the bagel is ₣4.
   - Therefore, the total cost before any discounts is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost before discount} = ₣294 + ₣4 = ₣298
     \]

5. **Apply the discount:**
   - Santiago receives a discount of ₣23 because he spent more than ₣50.
   - The total cost after the discount is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost after discount} = ₣298 - ₣23 = ₣275
     \]

Thus, the total amount Santiago has to pay is **₣275**.",275.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Santiago uses 3 kilograms of flour per day.
2. He needs flour for a week, which is 7 days.
3. So, the total amount of flour he needs is 3 kg/day * 7 days = 21 kg.

4. The normal brand of flour costs ₣10 per kilogram.
5. The more expensive brand costs 40% more than the normal brand.
6. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we calculate 40% of ₣10:
   - 40% of ₣10 = 0.40 * 10 = ₣4.
7. Therefore, the cost of the more expensive brand is:
   - ₣10 + ₣4 = ₣14 per kilogram.

8. Now, we calculate the total cost for 21 kg of the more expensive flour:
   - Total cost = 21 kg * ₣14/kg = ₣294.

9. Santiago also buys a bagel for ₣4.
10. So, the total cost including the bagel is:
    - Total cost = ₣294 + ₣4 = ₣298.

11. Since Santiago shopped more than ₣50, he receives a discount of ₣23.

What is the average of their scores?,199.0,"To find the average of Yusuf's and Oscar's scores, we first need to determine Oscar's score based on the information given.

1. **Yusuf's Score**: Yusuf scored 260 points.

2. **Oscar's Score Calculation**:
   - Oscar scored 8 points more than two-fourths of Yusuf's score.
   - First, we calculate two-fourths of Yusuf's score:
     \[
     \text{Two-fourths of Yusuf's score} = \frac{2}{4} \times 260 = \frac{1}{2} \times 260 = 130

   \text{Total grain} = \text{Grain for goats} + \text{Grain for alpacas} + \text{Grain for cows}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total grain} = 189 \text{ kg} + 105 \text{ kg} + 504 \text{ kg} = 798 \text{ kg}

Thus, Alejandro needs a total of **798 kilograms** of grain.",798.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of grain needed for each goat:**
   Each goat needs 9 kilograms of grain.

2. **Calculate the amount of grain needed for each alpaca:**
   Each alpaca needs 3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs is 2 * 9 = 18 kilograms.
   - Therefore, each alpaca needs 18 - 3 = 15 kilograms of grain.

3. **Calculate the amount of grain needed for each cow:**
   Each cow eats as much as a goat and an alpaca eat combined.
   - The total amount for one cow is 9 (for the goat) + 15 (for the alpaca) = 24 kilograms.

4. **Calculate the total amount of grain needed for all goats:**
   There are 21 goats.
   - Total for goats = 21 * 9 = 189 kilograms.

5. **Calculate the total amount of grain needed for all alpacas:**
   There are 7 alpacas.
   - Total for alpacas = 7 * 15 = 105 kilograms.

6. **Calculate the total amount of grain needed for all cows:**
   There are 21 cows.
   - Total for cows = 21 * 24 = 504 kilograms.

Due to the flu season, 35 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.",50.0,"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of occupied beds**:
   The hospital has a total of 800 beds, and \( \frac{1}{8} \) of them are occupied.
   \[
   \text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{8} \times 800 = 100 \text{ beds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of beds out of service**:
   One-fifth of all the beds are out of service.
   \[
   \text{Out of service beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 800 = 160 \text{ beds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of available beds**:
   The total number of available beds is the total number of beds minus the occupied beds and the out of service beds.
   \[
   \text{Available beds} = \text{Total beds} - \text{Occupied beds} - \text{Out of service beds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Available beds} = 800 - 100 - 160 = 540 \text{ beds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks**:
   There are 35 patients admitted each day. In 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted is:
   \[
   \text{Total patients admitted} = 35 \times 14 = 490 \text{ patients}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks**:
   After 2 weeks, the number of occupied beds will increase by the number of patients admitted.
   \[
   \text{New occupied beds} = \text{Initial occupied beds} + \text{Total patients admitted}
   \]
   \[
   \text{New occupied beds} = 100 + 490 = 590 \text{ beds}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks**:
   The total number of unoccupied beds is the total number of available beds minus the new occupied beds.
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied beds} = \text{Available beds} - (\text{New occupied beds} - \text{Out of service beds})
   \]
   Since the out of service beds do not change, we can directly calculate:
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied beds} = 800 - 590 = 210 \text{ beds}
   \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is \( \boxed{210} \).",210.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The hospital has a total capacity of 800 beds.
2. First, we need to find out how many beds are occupied. Since 1/8 of the beds are occupied:
   \[
   \text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{8} \times 800 = 100 \text{ beds}
   \]

3. Next, we find out how many beds are out of service. One-fifth of all the beds are out of service:
   \[
   \text{Out of service beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 800 = 160 \text{ beds}
   \]

4. Now, we can calculate the total number of beds that are either occupied or out of service:
   \[
   \text{Total occupied and out of service beds} = 100 + 160 = 260 \text{ beds}
   \]

5. To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total occupied and out of service beds from the total capacity:
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied beds} = 800 - 260 = 540 \text{ beds}
   \]

6. Now, we need to account for the 35 patients admitted each day for 2 weeks (14 days):
   \[
   \text{Total patients admitted} = 35 \times 14 = 490 \text{ patients}
   \]

7. Finally, we subtract the total patients admitted from the unoccupied beds:
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 540 - 490 = 50 \text{ beds}

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Andre is selling cupcakes and orange pies for a fundraiser. On Monday, he sold 24 boxes of cupcake and 16 fewer boxes of orange pie, than on Tuesday. On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday and 28 boxes of orange pie. On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the cupcake cost ₺10 and the orange pie cost ₺22, how much was Andre's average daily earning?",980.0,"To find Andre's average daily earning, we first need to determine how many boxes of cupcakes and orange pies he sold each day.

### Step 1: Determine the number of boxes sold on Monday
- **Cupcakes sold on Monday**: 24 boxes
- **Orange pies sold on Monday**: Since he sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pies than on Tuesday, we need to find out how many he sold on Tuesday first.

### Step 2: Determine the number of boxes sold on Tuesday
- **Cupcakes sold on Tuesday**: He sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday.
  \[
  \text{Cupcakes on Tuesday} = 24 + 11 = 35 \text{ boxes}
  \]
- **Orange pies sold on Tuesday**: He sold 28 boxes of orange pies.

### Step 3: Determine the number of boxes sold on Monday for orange pies
Since he sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pies on Monday than on Tuesday:
\[
\text{Orange pies on Monday} = 28 - 16 = 12 \text{ boxes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total boxes sold on Wednesday
On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined (Monday and Tuesday).
- **Total boxes sold on Monday**:
  \[
  \text{Total on Monday} = \text{Cupcakes} + \text{Orange pies} = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ boxes}
  \]
- **Total boxes sold on Tuesday**:
  \[
  \text{Total on Tuesday} = \text{Cupcakes} + \text{Orange pies} = 35 + 28 = 63 \text{ boxes}
  \]
- **Total boxes sold in the past two days**:
  \[
  \text{Total for Monday and Tuesday} = 36 + 63 = 99 \text{ boxes}
  \]
- Therefore, on Wednesday, he sold 99 boxes.

### Step 5: Calculate the earnings for each day
- **Earnings on Monday**:
  \[
  \text{Earnings} = (24 \text{ cupcakes} \times 10) + (12 \text{ orange pies} \times 22) = 240 + 264 = 504 \text{ ₺}
  \]
- **Earnings on Tuesday**:
  \[
  \text{Earnings} = (35 \text{ cupcakes} \times 10) + (28 \text{ orange pies} \times 22) = 350 + 616 = 966 \text{ ₺}
  \]
- **Earnings on Wednesday**:
  \[
  \text{Earnings} = (99 \text{ boxes}) \text{ (we need to find the distribution of cupcakes and orange pies)}
  \]
  We know he sold 35 cupcakes and 28 orange pies on Tuesday. The ratio of cupcakes to orange pies sold on Tuesday is:
  \[
  \text{Ratio} = \frac{35}{28} = \frac{5}{4}
  \]
  Let \( x \) be the number of cupcakes sold on Wednesday and \( y \) be the number of orange pies sold on Wednesday. Then:
  \[
  \frac{x}{y} = \frac{5}{4} \implies 4x = 5y \implies y = \frac{4}{5}x
  \]
  Since \( x + y = 99 \):
  \[
  x + \frac{4}{5}x = 99 \implies \frac{9}{5}x = 99 \implies x = 99 \times \frac{5}{9} = 55
  \]
  \[
  y = 99 - 55 = 44
  \]
- **Earnings on Wednesday**:
  \[
  \text{Earnings} = (55 \text{ cupcakes} \times 10) + (44 \text{ orange pies} \times 22) = 550 + 968 = 1518 \text{ ₺}
  \]

### Step 6: Calculate the total earnings and average daily earnings
- **Total earnings**:
  \[
  \text{Total} = 504 + 966 + 1518 = 2988 \text{ ₺}
  \]
- **Average daily earnings**:
  \[
  \text{Average} = \frac{2988}{3} = 996 \text{ ₺}
  \]

       - Orange pies: (since he sold 16 fewer than Tuesday, we need to find Tuesday's orange pies first)
       - On Tuesday, he sold 28 orange pies.
       - Therefore, on Monday, he sold:
         \[
         28 - 16 = 12 \text{ orange pies}
         \]
       - Total boxes sold on Monday:
         \[
         24 + 12 = 36
         \]
     - Total boxes sold on Tuesday:
       - Cupcakes: 35
       - Orange pies: 28
       - Total boxes sold on Tuesday:
         \[
         35 + 28 = 63
         \]
     - Total boxes sold over Monday and Tuesday:
       \[
       36 + 63 = 99

         240 + 264 = 504
         \]
     - **Tuesday:**
       - Earnings from cupcakes:
         \[
         35 \times 10 = 350

     - **Wednesday:**
       - Earnings from cupcakes:
         \[
         99 \times 10 = 990
         \]
       - Earnings from orange pies:

1. **Washing the clams**: Yara takes 19 minutes to wash all the clams.

2. **Peeling the clams**: Yara can peel 6 clams per minute. To find out how long it takes her to peel 60 clams, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Time to peel} = \frac{60 \text{ clams}}{6 \text{ clams/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}

3. **Sauteing the clams**: Yara can saute 20 clams in 8 minutes. To find out how long it takes her to saute 60 clams, we first determine how many batches of 20 clams are in 60 clams:
   \[
   \text{Number of batches} = \frac{60 \text{ clams}}{20 \text{ clams/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}

Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet. How much older is Liam's uncle than Liam?,22.0,"Let \( u \) be the age of Liam's uncle when he first saw Comet Halley, which is 31 years old. 

Since Comet Halley orbits the Sun every 53 years, we can determine the age of Liam's uncle when he saw the comet for the second time:

\[
u + 53 = 31 + 53 = 84
\]

Now, let \( l \) be Liam's age when he first saw the comet. We know that Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was twice the age of his uncle when he first saw it. Therefore, we can express this as:

\[
\text{Liam's age when he saw the comet for the second time} = 2 \times u = 2 \times 31 = 62
\]

Now, we need to find out how much older Liam's uncle is than Liam. 

Let \( x \) be the number of years that have passed since Liam first saw the comet. Then, we can express Liam's age when he first saw the comet as:

\[
l = 62 - x
\]

Since Liam's uncle is 53 years older than Liam when he first saw the comet, we can express the uncle's age as:

\[
u + 53 = 31 + 53 = 84
\]

Now, we can set up the equation:

\[
u + 53 - l = 84 - (62 - x)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
84 - 62 + x = 22 + x
\]

Now, we can find the difference in their ages:

\[
\text{Age difference} = (u + 53) - l = 84 - (62 - x) = 22 + x
\]

Since \( x \) is the number of years that have passed since Liam first saw the comet, we can conclude that the age difference remains constant. 

Thus, the age difference between Liam's uncle and Liam is:

\[
\text{Age difference} = 84 - l
\]

To find \( l \), we can substitute \( l = 62 - x \) into the equation:

\[
\text{Age difference} = 84 - (62 - x) = 22 + x
\]

Since \( x \) is the number of years since Liam first saw the comet, we can conclude that the age difference is:

\[
\text{Age difference} = 53
\]

Thus, Liam's uncle is 53 years older than Liam. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{53}
\]",53.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Liam's uncle saw Comet Halley when he was 31 years old.

4. Liam's uncle was 31 years old when he first saw the comet, so twice that age is 2 * 31 = 62 years old.
5. Since Liam's uncle saw the comet again after 53 years, we need to find out how old he is now. He is now 31 + 53 = 84 years old.
6. Now, we know that Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was 62 years old.

They agree to split it with Tara getting 190 yards more than Ananya, and Umar getting 30 yards more than Tara. How much is left over for Ananya?",150.0,"Let's denote the amount of fence Ananya gets as \( A \) yards. According to the problem, Tara gets 190 yards more than Ananya, so we can express Tara's amount as:

\[
T = A + 190
\]

Umar gets 30 yards more than Tara, so we can express Umar's amount as:

\[
U = T + 30 = (A + 190) + 30 = A + 220
\]

Now, we can set up an equation for the total amount of fence:

\[
A + T + U = 860
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( T \) and \( U \) into the equation gives us:

\[
A + (A + 190) + (A + 220) = 860
\]

Now, combine like terms:

\[
A + A + 190 + A + 220 = 860
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3A + 410 = 860

Next, we will isolate \( A \) by subtracting 410 from both sides:

\[
3A = 860 - 410

He then spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?",33.0,"To find out how many hours a week Santiago spends learning, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total class time per week:**
   - Santiago has 6 periods in a day, and he takes 3 extra classes. Therefore, he has a total of:
     \[
     6 + 3 = 9 \text{ classes per day}
     \]
   - Each class is 30 minutes long, so the total class time per day is:
     \[
     9 \text{ classes} \times 30 \text{ minutes/class} = 270 \text{ minutes/day}
     \]
   - He attends class for 4 days a week, so the total class time per week is:
     \[
     270 \text{ minutes/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 1080 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total review time per week:**
   - Santiago spends 15 minutes reviewing before each class. Since he has 9 classes per day, the review time per day is:
     \[
     9 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ minutes/class} = 135 \text{ minutes/day}
     \]
   - Over 4 days, the total review time per week is:
     \[
     135 \text{ minutes/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 540 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total learning time during the week:**
   - The total learning time per week (class time + review time) is:
     \[
     1080 \text{ minutes/week} + 540 \text{ minutes/week} = 1620 \text{ minutes/week}

Thus, Santiago spends a total of **33 hours a week** learning.",33.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of periods Santiago has in a day:**
   - He has 6 normal periods.
   - He takes 3 extra classes.
   - So, the total number of periods in a day is 6 + 3 = 9 periods.

2. **Calculate the total time spent in classes each day:**
   - Each class is 30 minutes long.
   - He has 3 extra classes, so the total time for extra classes is 3 * 30 = 90 minutes.
   - The total time spent in normal classes (6 periods) is 6 * 30 = 180 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in classes each day is 180 + 90 = 270 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time spent preparing for classes each day:**
   - He spends 15 minutes before each of the 3 extra classes to review.
   - So, the total preparation time for extra classes is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.
   - He does not need to prepare for the normal classes in this context, so the total preparation time is 45 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time spent learning each day:**
   - Total time spent in classes each day is 270 minutes.
   - Total preparation time each day is 45 minutes.
   - So, the total time spent learning each day is 270 + 45 = 315 minutes.

   - So, the total time spent learning in a week is 315 * 4 = 1260 minutes.

6. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - One-ninth of his weekly minutes is spent on Saturday and Sunday.
   - First, we need to find out how many minutes are in a week: 7 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes = 10,080 minutes.
   - One-ninth of 10,080 minutes is 10,080 / 9 = 1,120 minutes.
   - He spends this amount on Saturday and Sunday, so the total extra learning time for both days is 1,120 * 2 = 2,240 minutes.

7. **Calculate the total learning time for the week:**
   - Total learning time from classes and preparation is 1260 minutes.
   - Total extra learning time on the weekend is 2,240 minutes.
   - So, the total learning time for the week is 1260 + 2,240 = 3,500 minutes.

8. **Convert the total learning time from minutes to hours:**

On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?",75.0,"Let \( v \) be Olivia's original speed on the beach in kilometers per hour. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is \( 4v \).

Since Olivia's speed has decreased by half due to her injury, her new speed on the beach is \( \frac{v}{2} \) and her new speed on the sidewalk is \( \frac{4v}{2} = 2v \).

We know that Olivia spends 60 minutes (or 1 hour) walking on the beach. The distance she walks on the beach is 10 kilometers. We can use the formula for time, which is:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}

For the beach, we have:

\[
1 \text{ hour} = \frac{10 \text{ km}}{\frac{v}{2}}

Thus, we can solve for \( v \):

\[
v = 20 \text{ km/h}

Now, we can find Olivia's new speeds:

- Beach speed: \( \frac{v}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ km/h} \)
- Sidewalk speed: \( 2v = 2 \cdot 20 = 40 \text{ km/h} \)

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for Olivia to walk the 10 kilometers on the sidewalk. Using the time formula again:

\[
\text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{10 \text{ km}}{40 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ minutes}

Now, we can find the total time for the entire 20-kilometer walk:

\text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 60 \text{ minutes} + 15 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it takes for Olivia to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk is:

\[
\boxed{75} \text{ minutes}
\]",75.0,1,"A: Let's think step by step.

1. Olivia walks a total of 20 kilometers every day, which includes 10 kilometers on the beach and 10 kilometers on the sidewalk.

2. We know that Olivia's speed on the sidewalk is four times her speed on the beach. Let's denote her original speed on the beach as \( v \) kilometers per hour. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is \( 4v \) kilometers per hour.

3. Due to her injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half. So, her new speed on the beach is \( \frac{v}{2} \) kilometers per hour, and her new speed on the sidewalk is \( \frac{4v}{2} = 2v \) kilometers per hour.

4. We are told that Olivia spends 60 minutes (or 1 hour) walking on the beach. Since she walks 10 kilometers on the beach, we can find her speed on the beach:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   \[
   10 = \frac{v}{2} \times 1
   \]
   From this, we can solve for \( v \):
   \[
   10 = \frac{v}{2} \implies v = 20 \text{ kilometers per hour}
   \]

5. Now, we can find her new speed on the sidewalk:
   \[
   \text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2v = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ kilometers per hour}
   \]

6. Next, we need to calculate how long it takes her to walk the 10 kilometers on the sidewalk at her new speed:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10}{40} = 0.25 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. Converting 0.25 hours into minutes:
   \[
   0.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 15 \text{ minutes}
   \]

8. Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the entire 20-kilometer walk:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 60 \text{ minutes (beach)} + 15 \text{ minutes (sidewalk)} = 75 \text{ minutes}

However, due to a recent injury, the maintenance worker has become slower and it will take them twice as long to clean a floor these days. If they work for 6 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?",60.0,"To determine the percentage of the maintenance worker's day spent cleaning floors, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the time taken to clean one floor after the injury:**
   - Originally, it took 6 minutes per floor.
   - Due to the injury, it now takes twice as long:
     \[
     \text{Time per floor} = 6 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 12 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time required to clean all 180 floors:**
   - Total time in minutes:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 180 \text{ floors} \times 12 \text{ minutes/floor} = 2160 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
     \[
     \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{2160 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 36 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the total working hours over 10 days:**
   - The worker works 6 hours a day for 10 days:
     \[
     \text{Total working hours} = 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 10 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning floors:**
   - The percentage of time spent cleaning is given by the ratio of the total cleaning time to the total working time:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total cleaning time}}{\text{Total working time}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{36 \text{ hours}}{60 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 60\%
     \]

Thus, the maintenance worker spends **60%** of their day cleaning floors.",60.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. The maintenance worker has to clean 180 floors.
2. It normally takes them 6 minutes per floor, but due to their injury, it now takes them twice as long. So, the new time per floor is:
   \[
   6 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 12 \text{ minutes per floor}
   \]

3. To find the total time needed to clean all 180 floors, we multiply the number of floors by the time per floor:
   \[
   180 \text{ floors} \times 12 \text{ minutes per floor} = 2160 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. The maintenance worker has 10 days to clean the university. To find out how many minutes they can work each day, we first convert the 6 hours they work per day into minutes:
   \[
   6 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 360 \text{ minutes per day}
   \]

5. Over 10 days, the total time they can work is:
   \[
   10 \text{ days} \times 360 \text{ minutes per day} = 3600 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. Now, we need to find out what percentage of their working time is spent cleaning floors. We take the total time spent cleaning (2160 minutes) and divide it by the total working time (3600 minutes), then multiply by 100 to get the percentage:

Seeing how upset Gabriel was, his father gave him a pouch of beads with 7 beads inside. How many beads did Gabriel end up with?",67.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of beads**: Gabriel starts with 78 beads.

2. **Beads dropped**: He dropped one-third of the beads. To find out how many beads that is:
   \[
   \text{Beads dropped} = \frac{1}{3} \times 78 = 26
   \]

3. **Beads remaining after dropping**: After dropping 26 beads, the number of beads he has left is:
   \[
   \text{Beads remaining} = 78 - 26 = 52

1. **First 22 seconds**: 
   - Number of pops = 90

2. **Next 22 seconds**: 
   - Number of pops = 3 times the first amount = \(3 \times 90 = 270\)

3. **Next 22 seconds**: 
   - Number of pops = 4 times the initial amount = \(4 \times 90 = 360\)

4. **Final 22 seconds**: 
   - Number of pops = half the rate of the previous 22 seconds = \(\frac{360}{2} = 180\)

Now, let's calculate the total number of pops during the cooking:

\[
\text{Total pops} = 90 + 270 + 360 + 180

Calculating this step-by-step:

\[
90 + 270 = 360
