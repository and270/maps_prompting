gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Sophia went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, and 60 mini cheesecakes. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,"To find the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen, we can start by calculating the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes that Sophia bought.

1. **Calculate the cost of the donuts:**
   - Sophia bought 60 donuts.
   - Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, the number of dozens of donuts she bought is:
     \[
     \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ dozens}
     \]
   - The cost per dozen of donuts is $19, so the total cost for the donuts is:
     \[
     5 \text{ dozens} \times 19 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 95 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:**
   - Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes.
   - The number of dozens of mini cupcakes she bought is:
     \[
     \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ dozens}
     \]
   - The cost per dozen of mini cupcakes is $33, so the total cost for the mini cupcakes is:
     \[
     5 \text{ dozens} \times 33 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 165 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   - Let \( x \) be the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen.
   - The number of dozens of mini cheesecakes she bought is:
     \[
     \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ dozens}
     \]
   - The total cost for the mini cheesecakes is:
     \[
     5 \text{ dozens} \times x \text{ dollars/dozen} = 5x \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost before the discount is:
     \[
     95 + 165 + 5x = 260 + 5x \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**
   - Sophia received a 20% discount on her total cost. Therefore, she paid 80% of the total cost:
     \[
     0.8 \times (260 + 5x) = 1500
     \]

5. **Set up the equation and solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   0.8(260 + 5x) = 1500
   \]
   \[
   208 + 4x = 1500
   \]
   \[
   4x = 1500 - 208
   \]
   \[
   4x = 1292
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{1292}{4} = 323
   \]

Thus, the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is \(\boxed{323}\) dollars.",323.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the donuts:**
   - Sophia bought 60 donuts.
   - Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, she bought \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $19.
   - So, the total cost for the donuts is \( 5 \times 19 = 95 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:**
   - Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes.
   - Since there are 12 mini cupcakes in a dozen, she bought \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $33.
   - So, the total cost for the mini cupcakes is \( 5 \times 33 = 165 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   - The total cost before the discount is the sum of the costs of the donuts and mini cupcakes plus the cost of the mini cheesecakes.
   - Let \( x \) be the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen.
   - The total cost before the discount is \( 95 + 165 + x \).

4. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**
   - Sophia received a 20% discount on her total purchase.
   - The total amount she paid after the discount is $1500.
   - This means the total cost before the discount is \( \frac{1500}{1 - 0.20} = \frac{1500}{0.80} = 1875 \) dollars.

5. **Set up the equation:**
   - We have the equation: 
   \[
   95 + 165 + x = 1875
   \]

6. **Combine the known costs:**
   - \( 95 + 165 = 260 \).
   - So, the equation simplifies to:
   \[
   260 + x = 1875
   \]

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 260 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 1875 - 260 = 1615
   \]

8. **Calculate the cost per dozen of mini cheesecakes:**
   - Since \( x \) is the total cost for mini cheesecakes, we need to find the cost per dozen.
   - Sophia bought 60 mini cheesecakes, which is \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozen.
   - Therefore, the cost per dozen of mini cheesecakes is:
   \[
   \frac{1615}{5} = 323
   \]

The answer is $323 per dozen for the mini cheesecakes.",323.0,1,,323.0,1
gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving. A 300 grams bag has 6 servings. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?",350.0,"To determine how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara, we first need to calculate their daily calorie targets and how many calories they have left to consume.

### Step 1: Calculate Daily Calorie Targets

**Hiroshi's Daily Calorie Target:**
- Weight: 220 lbs
- Daily calorie target = 15 calories per pound of body weight
- Daily calorie target = 15 * 220 = 3300 calories

**Tara's Daily Calorie Target:**
- Weight: 140 lbs
- Daily calorie target = 15 calories per pound of body weight
- Daily calorie target = 15 * 140 = 2100 calories

### Step 2: Calculate Remaining Calories

**Hiroshi's Remaining Calories:**
- Calories consumed: 1100
- Calories burned through exercise: 200
- Net calories consumed = 1100 - 200 = 900
- Remaining calories = Daily calorie target - Net calories consumed
- Remaining calories = 3300 - 900 = 2400 calories

**Tara's Remaining Calories:**
- Calories consumed: 900 (food) + 200 (ice cream) = 1100 calories
- Remaining calories = Daily calorie target - Calories consumed
- Remaining calories = 2100 - 1100 = 1000 calories

### Step 3: Calculate Popcorn Consumption

**Calories per Serving of Popcorn:**
- Each serving has 200 calories.
- A bag of popcorn has 6 servings, so total calories in a bag = 200 * 6 = 1200 calories.

**Calories per Gram of Popcorn:**
- A 300 grams bag has 1200 calories.
- Therefore, calories per gram = 1200 / 300 = 4 calories/gram.

**Hiroshi's Required Grams of Popcorn:**
- Remaining calories = 2400 calories
- Grams of popcorn needed = Remaining calories / Calories per gram
- Grams of popcorn needed = 2400 / 4 = 600 grams

**Tara's Required Grams of Popcorn:**
- Remaining calories = 1000 calories
- Grams of popcorn needed = Remaining calories / Calories per gram
- Grams of popcorn needed = 1000 / 4 = 250 grams

### Step 4: Calculate the Difference in Popcorn Consumption

**Difference in Grams of Popcorn:**
- Difference = Hiroshi's grams - Tara's grams
- Difference = 600 grams - 250 grams = 350 grams

### Conclusion

Hiroshi needs to consume **350 more grams of popcorn** than Tara.",350.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate Hiroshi's daily calorie target:**
   - Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs.
   - The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight.
   - So, Hiroshi's daily calorie target is 220 lbs * 15 calories/lb = 3300 calories.

2. **Calculate Hiroshi's net calorie intake:**
   - Hiroshi has already consumed 1100 calories.
   - He has burned 200 calories through exercise.
   - So, his net calorie intake is 1100 - 200 = 900 calories.

3. **Calculate how many more calories Hiroshi can consume:**
   - Hiroshi's remaining calorie allowance is 3300 - 900 = 2400 calories.

4. **Calculate the calories in one serving of popcorn:**
   - A bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving.
   - There are 6 servings in a 300 grams bag.
   - Therefore, the total calories in the bag is 200 calories/serving * 6 servings = 1200 calories.

5. **Calculate how many grams of popcorn Hiroshi can consume:**
   - Since the entire bag (300 grams) has 1200 calories, we can find out how many grams correspond to 2400 calories.
   - The ratio of calories to grams is 1200 calories / 300 grams = 4 calories/gram.
   - To find out how many grams correspond to 2400 calories, we divide 2400 calories by 4 calories/gram:
     - 2400 / 4 = 600 grams.

6. **Calculate Tara's daily calorie target:**
   - Tara weighs 140 lbs.
   - So, her daily calorie target is 140 lbs * 15 calories/lb = 2100 calories.

7. **Calculate Tara's net calorie intake:**
   - Tara has already consumed 900 calories from food and 200 calories from ice cream.
   - So, her total consumption is 900 + 200 = 1100 calories.

8. **Calculate how many more calories Tara can consume:**
   - Tara's remaining calorie allowance is 2100 - 1100 = 1000 calories.

9. **Calculate how many grams of popcorn Tara can consume:**
   - Using the same ratio of calories to grams (4 calories/gram), we find out how many grams correspond to 1000 calories:
     - 1000 / 4 = 250 grams.

10. **Calculate how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara:**
    - Hiroshi can consume 600 grams of popcorn.
    - Tara can consume 250 grams of popcorn.
    - The difference is 600 grams - 250 grams = 350 grams.

The answer is 350 grams.",350.0,1,,350.0,1

She already has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges of her large country home. She also purchased 200 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Daphne remain with?",335.0,"To find out how many potted plants Daphne will have remaining, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of potted plants Daphne currently has:**
   - She has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges.
   - Total plants from ledges = 8 plants/ledge × 56 ledges = 448 plants.
   - She received 23 new potted plants from the nursery.
   - Total plants after receiving new ones = 448 plants + 23 plants = 471 plants.

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 60 minutes to cover every 4 miles of the city. However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city, we first need to understand the speed at which the fog is moving.

1. **Calculate the speed of the fog:**
   The fog covers 4 miles in 60 minutes. Therefore, the speed of the fog is:
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{15} \text{ miles per minute}
   \]

2. **Determine the distance to cover 1/4 of the city:**
   The city is 80 miles across, so 1/4 of the city is:
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ miles}}{4} = 20 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time to cover 20 miles at the current speed:**
   Using the speed of the fog, we can find the time it takes to cover 20 miles:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{20 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{15} \text{ miles per minute}} = 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Consider the effect of the wind speed halving:**
   The problem states that the wind speed will be halved in one hour. Since the fog is currently moving at \(\frac{1}{15}\) miles per minute, if the wind speed is halved, the new speed will be:
   \[
   \text{New Speed} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{15} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ miles per minute}
   \]

5. **Calculate the time to cover 20 miles with the new speed:**
   After one hour (60 minutes), the fog will be moving at \(\frac{1}{30}\) miles per minute. The time to cover 20 miles at this new speed is:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{20 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{30} \text{ miles per minute}} = 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Total time to cover 20 miles:**
   The fog will take 60 minutes to cover the first 4 miles at the original speed. After that, it will take 600 minutes to cover the remaining 20 miles at the new speed. Therefore, the total time to cover 20 miles is:
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 60 \text{ minutes} + 600 \text{ minutes} = 660 \text{ minutes}

The answer is 300 minutes.",300.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes.
2. The total distance of the city from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge is 80 miles.
3. We need to find out how long it takes for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city.
4. 1/4 of 80 miles is 80 / 4 = 20 miles.
5. Since the fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, we can find out how long it takes to cover 20 miles.
6. To find the time to cover 20 miles, we can set up a proportion:
   - If 4 miles takes 60 minutes, then 20 miles will take (20 miles / 4 miles) * 60 minutes = 5 * 60 minutes = 300 minutes.
7. However, we need to consider that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. This means that the fog bank will cover less distance in the same amount of time after one hour.
8. Since the fog bank covers 4 miles in the first hour, after that, it will cover half of that distance in the next hour, which is 2 miles in 60 minutes.
9. Therefore, in the first hour, it covers 4 miles, and in the second hour, it covers 2 miles, totaling 6 miles in 120 minutes.
10. To cover the remaining 14 miles (20 miles - 6 miles), we will continue with the halved speed of 2 miles per hour.
11. The time to cover the remaining 14 miles at 2 miles per hour is 14 miles / 2 miles per hour = 7 hours = 420 minutes.

On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 2-hour episodes. On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?",6.0,"To find out how many 15-minute episodes Santiago watched on Thursday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he spent watching TV from Tuesday to Sunday, excluding Thursday.

1. **Tuesday**: Watched 4 hours.
2. **Wednesday**: Watched 4 hours.
3. **Thursday**: Watched \( x \) episodes of 15 minutes each (we will calculate this later).
4. **Friday**: Watched 3 hours and 45 minutes.
   - Convert 45 minutes to hours: \( 45 \text{ minutes} = \frac{45}{60} = 0.75 \text{ hours} \).
   - Total for Friday: \( 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 \text{ hours} \).
5. **Saturday**: Watched three 2-hour episodes.
   - Total for Saturday: \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \).
6. **Sunday**: Watched three 15-minute episodes.
   - Convert 15 minutes to hours: \( 15 \text{ minutes} = \frac{15}{60} = 0.25 \text{ hours} \).
   - Total for Sunday: \( 3 \times 0.25 = 0.75 \text{ hours} \).

Now, let's sum the hours from Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:

2. **Add the hours from Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday:**
   - Total hours from Tuesday and Wednesday = 4 + 4 = 8 hours.
   - Total hours from Friday = 3.75 hours.
   - Total hours from Saturday = 6 hours.
   - So, total hours from Tuesday to Saturday = 8 + 3.75 + 6 = 17.75 hours.

3. **Calculate the total hours watched on Sunday:**
   - On Sunday, he watched three 15-minute episodes.
   - 15 minutes = 0.25 hours.

She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, and uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the ratios and the total amounts used by Nia.

1. **Understanding the Ratios**:
   - The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is given as 54:27. This can be simplified:
     \[
     \frac{54}{27} = 2
     \]
   - This means for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, there are 1 cup of water.

2. **Milk and Cream Ratios**:
   - Nia uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, which simplifies to 1 tablespoon of milk per cup of water.
   - She uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar.

3. **Setting Up the Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of teaspoons of sugar used.
   - From the sugar to water ratio, the number of cups of water used will be \( \frac{x}{2} \).
   - The number of tablespoons of milk used will be equal to the number of cups of water, which is \( \frac{x}{2} \).
   - The number of tablespoons of heavy cream used will be \( 2x \) (since she uses 2 tablespoons of cream for every teaspoon of sugar).

4. **Total Amounts**:
   - The total amount of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is given as 240. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x + \frac{x}{2} = 240
   \]

5. **Combining Like Terms**:
   - Combine the terms:
   \[
   x + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = 240
   \]
   - This simplifies to:
   \[
   x + 2x + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 240
   \]
   - Which further simplifies to:
   \[
   x + 2x + x = 240
   \]
   - Thus:
   \[
   4x = 240
   \]

6. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = \frac{240}{4} = 60

Therefore, the number of teaspoons of sugar Nia used is \( \boxed{60} \).",60.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. We know that Nia uses sugar and water in a ratio of 54:27. This means for every 54 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 27 cups of water. 

2. We can simplify this ratio. Dividing both parts by 27 gives us:
   - Sugar: 54 / 27 = 2
   - Water: 27 / 27 = 1
   So, the simplified ratio is 2:1. This means for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 1 cup of water.

3. Nia also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water. This means she uses 1 tablespoon of milk for every cup of water.

4. Additionally, she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar.

5. Now, we need to find out how many total parts are involved in the mixture. 
   - For sugar (S) and water (W), we have:
     - 2 parts sugar + 1 part water = 3 parts
   - For milk (M), since she uses 1 tablespoon of milk for every cup of water, we have 1 part milk for every 1 part water.
   - For cream (C), she uses 2 tablespoons of cream for every teaspoon of sugar, which means for every 2 parts of sugar, there are 2 parts of cream.

6. Now, let's summarize the parts:
   - Sugar: 2 parts
   - Water: 1 part
   - Milk: 1 part (since it corresponds to the 1 part of water)
   - Cream: 2 parts (since it corresponds to the 2 parts of sugar)

7. Adding these parts together gives us:
   - Total parts = 2 (sugar) + 1 (water) + 1 (milk) + 2 (cream) = 6 parts.

8. We know that the total amount used is 240 teaspoons (which includes sugar, water, milk, and cream). 

9. To find the value of each part, we divide the total amount by the number of parts:
   - Value of each part = 240 / 6 = 40.

10. Now, we can find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used:
    - Since sugar corresponds to 2 parts, we calculate:
    - Teaspoons of sugar = 2 parts * 40 = 80 teaspoons.

The answer is 80.",80.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Nia uses sugar and water in a ratio of 54:27. This means for every 54 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 27 cups of water. We can simplify this ratio:
   - 54:27 simplifies to 2:1 (since both numbers can be divided by 27).

2. Nia also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water. This means she uses 1 tablespoon of milk for every cup of water.

3. Additionally, she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar.

4. We know that the total amount of ingredients used (sugar, water, cream, and milk) is 240 teaspoons.

5. Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as \( S \), the number of cups of water as \( W \), the number of tablespoons of cream as \( C \), and the number of tablespoons of milk as \( M \).

6. From the ratio of sugar to water (2:1), we can express the cups of water in terms of teaspoons of sugar:
   - \( W = \frac{S}{2} \).

7. From the milk usage, since she uses 1 tablespoon of milk for every cup of water:
   - \( M = W = \frac{S}{2} \).

8. From the cream usage, since she uses 2 tablespoons of cream for every teaspoon of sugar:
   - \( C = 2S \).

9. Now we can set up the equation for the total amount of ingredients:
   \[
   S + W + C + M = 240.
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for \( W \), \( C \), and \( M \):
   \[
   S + \frac{S}{2} + 2S + \frac{S}{2} = 240.
   \]

10. Combining like terms:
   \[
   S + \frac{S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} + 2S = 240,
   \]
   \[
   4S = 240.
   \]

11. Solving for \( S \):
   \[
   S = \frac{240}{4} = 60.
   \]

The answer is 60 teaspoons of sugar.",60.0,1

She noticed that she was out of plastic forks, so she bought a new package of forks. Later, her husband also bought a package of 8 new forks and gave them to Aisha. While Aisha was making the stuffed peppers, she used sixteen of the forks to sample her stuffed peppers, then threw away 6 defective forks. The guests also brought 2 packs of forks, each having 6 inside them. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 32 forks. How many forks were in the package that Aisha bought?",34.0,"Let's denote the number of forks in the package that Aisha bought as \( x \).

1. Aisha bought \( x \) forks.
2. Her husband bought 8 forks.
3. Aisha used 16 forks to sample the stuffed peppers.
4. Aisha threw away 6 defective forks.
5. The guests brought 2 packs of forks, each containing 6 forks, which totals \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) forks.

Now, we can set up the equation to find the total number of forks Aisha had after all these transactions:

\[
\text{Total forks} = x + 8 - 16 - 6 + 12
\]

We know that the total number of forks Aisha had at the end was 32. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
x + 8 - 16 - 6 + 12 = 32

Now, simplify the left side:

\[
x + 8 - 16 - 6 + 12 = x + (8 - 16 - 6 + 12)
\]
\[
= x + (8 + 12 - 16 - 6)

\[
= x + (20 - 22)

### Conclusion

The least amount Arjun can spend is:
\[
\boxed{212.00} \text{ dollars}
\]",212.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost without any discounts:**
   - Cost of folders: 12 folders * $4.75 each = 12 * 4.75 = $57.00
   - Cost of erasers: 8 erasers * $14.50 each = 8 * 14.50 = $116.00
   - Cost of bond paper: 1 ream * $11.00 = $11.00
   - Cost of pencils: 7 pencils * $8.00 each = 7 * 8 = $56.00

   Now, let's add these costs together:
   - Total cost = $57.00 + $116.00 + $11.00 + $56.00 = $240.00

2. **Calculate the total cost with membership and a 20% discount:**
   - Membership fee = $20.00
   - Total cost before discount = $240.00
   - Discount = 20% of $240.00 = 0.20 * 240 = $48.00
   - Total cost with membership = $240.00 - $48.00 + $20.00 = $240.00 - $48.00 + $20.00 = $212.00

3. **Calculate the total cost without membership and a 5% discount:**
   - Total cost before discount = $240.00
   - Discount = 5% of $240.00 = 0.05 * 240 = $12.00
   - Total cost without membership = $240.00 - $12.00 = $228.00

4. **Compare the two total costs:**
   - Total cost with membership = $212.00

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Yusuf is rolling a twenty-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row, than that he rolls four even numbers in a row?",50.0,"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events: rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row and rolling four even numbers in a row with a twenty-sided die.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5.

A twenty-sided die has the numbers 1 through 20. The numbers greater than 5 are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. 

Counting these, we find:
- Numbers greater than 5: 15 (from 6 to 20)

The probability \( P(\text{greater than 5}) \) is:
\[
P(\text{greater than 5}) = \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is:
\[
P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) = P(\text{greater than 5}) \times P(\text{greater than 5}) = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) \times \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \frac{9}{16}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the probability of rolling an even number.

The even numbers on a twenty-sided die are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20. 

Counting these, we find:
- Even numbers: 10 (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20)

The probability \( P(\text{even}) \) is:
\[
P(\text{even}) = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling an even number four times in a row is:
\[
P(\text{even four times}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16}
\]

### Step 5: Compare the probabilities.

Now we have:
- Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice: \( \frac{9}{16} \)
- Probability of rolling four even numbers: \( \frac{1}{16} \)

### Step 6: Calculate the difference in percentage points.

To express these probabilities as percentages:
- Probability of rolling greater than 5 twice:
\[
\frac{9}{16} \times 100 = 56.25\%
\]
- Probability of rolling four even numbers:
\[
\frac{1}{16} \times 100 = 6.25\%
\]

Now, we find the difference:
\[
\text{Difference} = 56.25\% - 6.25\% = 50\%
\]

### Final Answer

Yusuf is **50 percentage points** more likely to roll a number greater than 5 twice in a row than to roll four even numbers in a row.",5.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a twenty-sided die.**
   - The numbers greater than 5 on a twenty-sided die are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
   - There are 15 numbers greater than 5.
   - The total number of outcomes on a twenty-sided die is 20.
   - So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is:
     \[
     P(\text{greater than 5}) = \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row.**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is:
     \[
     P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) = P(\text{greater than 5}) \times P(\text{greater than 5}) = 0.75 \times 0.75 = 0.5625
     \]

3. **Determine the probability of rolling an even number on a twenty-sided die.**
   - The even numbers on a twenty-sided die are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20.
   - There are 10 even numbers.
   - So, the probability of rolling an even number is:
     \[
     P(\text{even}) = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]

4. **Calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row.**
   - The probability of rolling an even number four times in a row is:
     \[
     P(\text{even four times}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.5^4 = 0.0625
     \]

5. **Calculate the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row and rolling four even numbers in a row.**
   - The difference is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) - P(\text{even four times}) = 0.5625 - 0.0625 = 0.5
     \]

6. **Convert the difference to percentage points.**
   - To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     \text{Difference in percentage points} = 0.5 \times 100 = 50
     \]

What percentage of animals in the plot were rabbits?",20.0,"To find the percentage of animals in the plot that were rabbits, we first need to determine the total number of animals and the number of rabbits.

1. **Calculate the number of rabbits:**
   - Mia found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. 
   - Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
     \[
     \text{Number of rabbits} = \frac{26}{2} = 13

2. **Count the total number of animals:**
   - We know the following:
     - Number of rabbits = 13
     - Number of wasps = 24
     - Number of bees = 9
   - We also need to find the number of beetles. Mia found \( \frac{2}{3} \) as many beetles as bees. Since there are 9 bees, the number of beetles is:
     \[
     \text{Number of beetles} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6

1. Mia found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. 
   - Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13.
   - So, there are 13 rabbits.

2. Mia also saw 24 wasps and 9 bees.
   - The total number of animals is the sum of rabbits, wasps, and bees.

   \text{Number of beetles} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
   \]
3. Mia found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
   \]
4. In total, the number of animals in the plot is the sum of bees, beetles, rabbits, and wasps:
   - Bees: 9
   - Beetles: 6
   - Rabbits: 13
   - Wasps: 24
   \[
   \text{Total animals} = 9 + 6 + 13 + 24 = 52

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?",11000.0,"To determine how much more the total cost will be than Mrs. Lee's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the townhouse after applying the discount and adding the brokerage and transfer fees.

1. **Calculate the discount on the selling price:**
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = 400,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 25\% \text{ of Selling Price} = 0.25 \times 400,000 = 100,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Discount} = 400,000 - 100,000 = 300,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee (5% of the selling price):**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 5\% \text{ of Selling Price} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the transfer fee (12% of the selling price):**
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 12\% \text{ of Selling Price} = 0.12 \times 400,000 = 48,000

He paid the legal fees that amounted to 2% of the selling price and also paid a realtor fee that is 5% of the selling price. He also paid $440000 for the remaining loan amount on the villa, and $5000 for closing costs. Dr. Brown used the net proceeds from selling the villa to invest in stocks. The stocks gained 10% each year for two years. How much were Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years?",80465.0,"To find Dr. Brown's net proceeds after selling his villa and investing the money in stocks, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total selling costs (legal fees and realtor fees).**
2. **Determine the net proceeds from the sale of the villa.**
3. **Calculate the value of the investment in stocks after two years.**

### Step 1: Calculate Selling Costs

**Selling Price of the Villa:** $550,000

**Legal Fees:**  
Legal fees are 2% of the selling price.  
\[
\text{Legal Fees} = 0.02 \times 550,000 = 11,000
\]

**Realtor Fees:**  
Realtor fees are 5% of the selling price.  
\[
\text{Realtor Fees} = 0.05 \times 550,000 = 27,500
\]

**Total Selling Costs:**  
\[
\text{Total Selling Costs} = \text{Legal Fees} + \text{Realtor Fees} = 11,000 + 27,500 = 38,500
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Net Proceeds

**Remaining Loan Amount:** $440,000  
**Closing Costs:** $5,000  

**Total Costs:**  
\[
\text{Total Costs} = \text{Total Selling Costs} + \text{Remaining Loan Amount} + \text{Closing Costs} = 38,500 + 440,000 + 5,000 = 483,500
\]

**Net Proceeds from Sale:**  
\[
\text{Net Proceeds} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Total Costs} = 550,000 - 483,500 = 66,500
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Value of Investment in Stocks After Two Years

Dr. Brown invests the net proceeds of $66,500 in stocks that gain 10% each year.

**Value After Year 1:**  
\[
\text{Value After Year 1} = \text{Initial Investment} \times (1 + \text{Rate}) = 66,500 \times (1 + 0.10) = 66,500 \times 1.10 = 73,150
\]

**Value After Year 2:**  
\[
\text{Value After Year 2} = \text{Value After Year 1} \times (1 + \text{Rate}) = 73,150 \times (1 + 0.10) = 73,150 \times 1.10 = 80,465
\]

### Final Result

Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years of investing in stocks is **$80,465**.",80465.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the legal fees:**
   - The selling price of the villa is $550,000.
   - The legal fees are 2% of the selling price.
   - Legal fees = 2% of $550,000 = 0.02 * 550,000 = $11,000.

2. **Calculate the realtor fee:**
   - The realtor fee is 5% of the selling price.
   - Realtor fee = 5% of $550,000 = 0.05 * 550,000 = $27,500.

3. **Calculate the total fees paid:**
   - Total fees = Legal fees + Realtor fee = $11,000 + $27,500 = $38,500.

4. **Calculate the net proceeds from the sale:**
   - Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees - Remaining loan amount - Closing costs.
   - Remaining loan amount = $440,000.
   - Closing costs = $5,000.
   - Net proceeds = $550,000 - $38,500 - $440,000 - $5,000 = $66,500.

5. **Calculate the investment growth over two years:**
   - The stocks gain 10% each year.
   - After the first year, the value of the investment = Net proceeds + (10% of Net proceeds).
   - After the first year = $66,500 + (0.10 * $66,500) = $66,500 + $6,650 = $73,150.
   - After the second year, the value of the investment = $73,150 + (10% of $73,150).
   - After the second year = $73,150 + (0.10 * $73,150) = $73,150 + $7,315 = $80,465.

An eighth of the tennis balls are indigo, and all except an eighth of those indigo balls are marked. How many marked balls are there in total?",16.0,"To find the total number of marked balls, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of balls**: The juggler can juggle 160 balls.

2. **Golf balls**: 
   - \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the balls are golf balls.
   - Number of golf balls = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 160 = 32 \).

3. **Tennis balls**: 
   - The rest are tennis balls.
   - Number of tennis balls = Total balls - Golf balls = \( 160 - 32 = 128 \).

4. **Marked golf balls**:
   - \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the golf balls are yellow.
   - Number of yellow golf balls = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 32 = 16 \).
   - \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the yellow golf balls are marked.
   - Number of marked yellow golf balls = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 16 = 2 \).

5. **Marked tennis balls**:
   - \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the tennis balls are indigo.
   - Number of indigo tennis balls = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 128 = 16 \).
   - All except \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the indigo balls are marked.
   - Number of marked indigo tennis balls = Total indigo tennis balls - Unmarked indigo tennis balls.
   - Unmarked indigo tennis balls = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 16 = 2 \).
   - Therefore, marked indigo tennis balls = \( 16 - 2 = 14 \).

6. **Total marked balls**:

3. The rest of the balls are tennis balls. To find the number of tennis balls, we subtract the number of golf balls from the total:
   \[
   \text{Number of tennis balls} = 160 - 32 = 128

4. Next, we find out how many of the golf balls are yellow. It states that 1/2 of the golf balls are yellow:
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow golf balls} = \frac{1}{2} \times 32 = 16
   \]

5. Out of the yellow golf balls, 1/8 are marked:
   \[
   \text{Number of marked yellow golf balls} = \frac{1}{8} \times 16 = 2

   \[
   \text{Number of unmarked indigo balls} = \frac{1}{8} \times 16 = 2

   Therefore, the number of marked indigo balls is:
   \[
   \text{Number of marked indigo balls} = 16 - 2 = 14

If there are one-fourth the number of boys in the park, what percentage of the kids in the park are girls?",80.0,"To find the percentage of kids in the park that are girls, we first need to determine the number of boys in the park.

We know that there are 16 girls, and the number of boys is one-fourth the number of girls. Therefore, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Number of girls} = \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4
\]

Now, we can find the total number of kids in the park by adding the number of girls and boys:

\[
\text{Total number of kids} = \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of boys} = 16 + 4 = 20

Total kids = Number of girls + Number of boys = 16 + 4 = 20.  

Next, we need to find the percentage of kids that are girls.  
The percentage of girls = (Number of girls / Total kids) * 100.

1. **Cost of fudge:**
   - Priya bought 21 kgs of fudge.
   - The offer is ""Buy 15 kgs at ₺22 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/4 off.""
   - First, calculate the cost for the first 15 kgs:

   - Now, for the additional 6 kgs (21 kgs total - 15 kgs):
     - The first 4 kgs of the additional fudge are at a 1/4 discount.
     - The price for 4 kgs at ₺22 per kg = 4 * ₺22 = ₺88.
     - The discount on ₺88 = ₺88 * 1/4 = ₺22.

What percentage of all the puppies have spots?",90.0,"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to calculate the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots from all the dogs mentioned.

1. **Calculate the total number of puppies:**
   - Jamal's dog: 131 puppies
   - Gabriel's dog: 47 puppies
   - Yuki's dogs: 54 dogs, each with 13 puppies, so:
     \[
     54 \times 13 = 702 \text{ puppies}

   Now, we sum these numbers:
   \[
   131 + 47 + 702 = 880 \text{ total puppies}

2. **Calculate the total number of puppies with spots:**
   - Jamal's spotted puppies: 23

   - According to the problem, half of these unspotted puppies actually have spots that were not visible before:
     \[

1. **Calculate the total number of puppies for each person:**
   - Jamal's dog has 131 puppies.
   - Gabriel's dog has 47 puppies.
   - Yuki has 54 dogs, each with 13 puppies, so the total number of puppies from Yuki is 54 * 13 = 702 puppies.

2. **Calculate the total number of puppies:**
   - Total puppies = Jamal's puppies + Gabriel's puppies + Yuki's puppies
   - Total puppies = 131 + 47 + 702 = 880 puppies.

3. **Calculate the number of spotted puppies:**
   - Jamal has 23 spotted puppies.
   - Gabriel has 13 spotted puppies.
   - Yuki has 54 dogs, each with 13 spotted puppies, so the total number of spotted puppies from Yuki is 54 * 13 = 702 spotted puppies.
   - Total spotted puppies = Jamal's spotted + Gabriel's spotted + Yuki's spotted
   - Total spotted puppies = 23 + 13 + 702 = 738 spotted puppies.

4. **Calculate the number of unspotted puppies for Jamal:**
   - Jamal's unspotted puppies = Total puppies - Spotted puppies
   - Jamal's unspotted puppies = 131 - 23 = 108 unspotted puppies.

5. **Determine how many of Jamal's unspotted puppies actually have spots:**
   - Half of Jamal's unspotted puppies have spots: 108 / 2 = 54 puppies.

6. **Calculate the new total number of spotted puppies:**
   - New total spotted puppies = Original spotted puppies + Newly discovered spotted puppies
   - New total spotted puppies = 738 + 54 = 792 spotted puppies.

7. **Calculate the percentage of puppies that have spots:**
   - Percentage of spotted puppies = (Total spotted puppies / Total puppies) * 100

Later, Uma saw another 10-foot shark with 6 remoras, each 8 inches long, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?",45.0,"To find the average percentage of each shark's body length that is covered by the remoras, we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert the lengths of the sharks and remoras to the same unit (inches).**
2. **Calculate the total length of the remoras for each shark.**
3. **Determine the percentage of the shark's body length that is covered by the remoras.**
4. **Calculate the average percentage for both sharks.**

### Step 1: Convert lengths to inches

- **40-foot shark:**
  \[
  40 \text{ feet} = 40 \times 12 = 480 \text{ inches}
  \]

- **10-foot shark:**
  \[
  10 \text{ feet} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ inches}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total length of the remoras

- **For the 40-foot shark:**
  - There are 18 remoras, each 16 inches long.
  - Total length of remoras before any swim away:
  \[
  18 \times 16 = 288 \text{ inches}
  \]
  - After \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the remoras swim away:
  \[
  \frac{1}{6} \times 18 = 3 \text{ remoras swim away}
  \]
  - Remaining remoras:
  \[
  18 - 3 = 15 \text{ remoras}
  \]
  - Total length of remaining remoras:
  \[
  15 \times 16 = 240 \text{ inches}
  \]

- **For the 10-foot shark:**
  - There are 6 remoras, each 8 inches long.
  - Total length of remoras:
  \[
  6 \times 8 = 48 \text{ inches}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras

- **For the 40-foot shark:**
  \[
  \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100
  \]
  \[
  \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{240}{480} \right) \times 100 = 50\%

\text{Average Percentage} = \frac{50\% + 40\%}{2} = \frac{90\%}{2} = 45\%
\]

### Final Answer
The average percentage of each shark's body length that is covered by the remoras is **45%**.",45.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the first shark:**
   - There are 18 remoras, each 16 inches long.
   - Total length of remoras = 18 * 16 = 288 inches.

2. **Convert the shark's length from feet to inches:**
   - The first shark is 40 feet long.
   - 1 foot = 12 inches, so 40 feet = 40 * 12 = 480 inches.

3. **Calculate the percentage of the first shark's body length covered by the remoras:**
   - Percentage = (Total length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100
   - Percentage for the first shark = (288 / 480) * 100 = 60%.

4. **Calculate how many remoras swam away:**
   - 1/6 of the 18 remoras swam away.
   - Number of remoras that swam away = 18 / 6 = 3.
   - Remaining remoras = 18 - 3 = 15.

5. **Calculate the total length of the remaining remoras:**
   - Remaining remoras = 15, each 16 inches long.
   - Total length of remaining remoras = 15 * 16 = 240 inches.

6. **Calculate the percentage of the first shark's body length covered by the remaining remoras:**
   - Percentage for the remaining remoras = (240 / 480) * 100 = 50%.

7. **Now, calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the second shark:**
   - There are 6 remoras, each 8 inches long.
   - Total length of remoras = 6 * 8 = 48 inches.

8. **Convert the second shark's length from feet to inches:**
   - The second shark is 10 feet long.
   - 10 feet = 10 * 12 = 120 inches.

9. **Calculate the percentage of the second shark's body length covered by the remoras:**
   - Percentage for the second shark = (48 / 120) * 100 = 40%.

10. **Calculate the average percentage of both sharks' body lengths covered by the remoras:**
    - Average percentage = (Percentage of first shark + Percentage of second shark) / 2
    - Average percentage = (60 + 40) / 2 = 50%.

The answer is 50%.",50.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the first shark.

1. Uma saw a 40-foot shark with 18 remoras, each 16 inches long.
   - Convert the length of the shark from feet to inches: 
     40 feet = 40 * 12 = 480 inches.
   - Calculate the total length of the remoras:
     Total length of remoras = 18 remoras * 16 inches/remora = 288 inches.

2. Next, we find out how many remoras swam away.
   - 1/6 of the remoras swam away:
     Number of remoras that swam away = 1/6 * 18 = 3 remoras.
   - So, the remaining number of remoras = 18 - 3 = 15 remoras.
   - Calculate the new total length of the remaining remoras:
     Total length of remaining remoras = 15 remoras * 16 inches/remora = 240 inches.

3. Now, we calculate the percentage of the first shark's body length that is covered by the remaining remoras:
   - Percentage covered = (Total length of remaining remoras / Length of shark) * 100
   - Percentage covered = (240 inches / 480 inches) * 100 = 50%.

Next, we calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the second shark.

4. Uma saw another 10-foot shark with 6 remoras, each 8 inches long.
   - Convert the length of the shark from feet to inches:
     10 feet = 10 * 12 = 120 inches.
   - Calculate the total length of the remoras:
     Total length of remoras = 6 remoras * 8 inches/remora = 48 inches.

5. Now, we calculate the percentage of the second shark's body length that is covered by the remoras:
   - Percentage covered = (Total length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100
   - Percentage covered = (48 inches / 120 inches) * 100 = 40%.

Finally, we find the average percentage of both sharks' body lengths covered by the remoras:

6. Average percentage = (Percentage covered by first shark + Percentage covered by second shark) / 2
   - Average percentage = (50% + 40%) / 2 = 45%.

Carlos has 720 almonds, 7 bowls and 3 tables. Unfortunately, 2 tables break. Carlos then eats one-fifth of all the almonds. How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?",14.0,"To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the capacity of the bowls and tables.**
   - Each bowl can hold 24 almonds.
   - Each table can hold three times that, which is \(3 \times 24 = 72\) almonds.

2. **Determine the total capacity of the bowls and tables before any breakage.**
   - Carlos has 7 bowls, so the total capacity of the bowls is:
     \[
     7 \text{ bowls} \times 24 \text{ almonds/bowl} = 168 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - Carlos has 3 tables, so the total capacity of the tables is:
     \[
     3 \text{ tables} \times 72 \text{ almonds/table} = 216 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total capacity of all bowls and tables combined is:
     \[
     168 \text{ almonds} + 216 \text{ almonds} = 384 \text{ almonds}
     \]

3. **Account for the broken tables.**
   - After 2 tables break, Carlos has:
     \[
     3 - 2 = 1 \text{ table}
     \]
   - The capacity of the remaining table is:
     \[
     1 \text{ table} \times 72 \text{ almonds/table} = 72 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - The total capacity now with the remaining bowls and tables is:
     \[
     168 \text{ almonds (bowls)} + 72 \text{ almonds (1 table)} = 240 \text{ almonds}
     \]

4. **Calculate how many almonds Carlos has after eating some.**
   - Carlos starts with 720 almonds and eats one-fifth of them:
     \[
     \text{Almonds eaten} = \frac{1}{5} \times 720 = 144 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - The remaining almonds are:
     \[
     720 - 144 = 576 \text{ almonds}
     \]

5. **Determine how many more bowls are needed to hold the remaining almonds.**
   - Carlos can currently hold 240 almonds with the bowls and the remaining table.
   - The number of additional almonds that need to be accommodated is:
     \[
     576 - 240 = 336 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - To find out how many additional bowls are needed, we divide the additional almonds by the capacity of each bowl:
     \[
     \text{Additional bowls needed} = \frac{336 \text{ almonds}}{24 \text{ almonds/bowl}} = 14 \text{ bowls}

1. **Determine the capacity of the tables**: 
   Each bowl can hold 24 almonds. 
   Each table can hold three times that, so:
   \[
   \text{Capacity of each table} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ almonds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and tables**:
   Carlos has 7 bowls and 3 tables, but 2 tables break, leaving him with:
   \[
   \text{Remaining tables} = 3 - 2 = 1 \text{ table}
   \]
   Now, we calculate the total capacity:
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of bowls} = 7 \times 24 = 168 \text{ almonds}

   \[
   \text{Total capacity of remaining table} = 1 \times 72 = 72 \text{ almonds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = 168 + 72 = 240 \text{ almonds}
   \]

3. **Determine how many almonds Carlos has left after eating**:
   Carlos starts with 720 almonds. He eats one-fifth of all the almonds:
   \[
   \text{Almonds eaten} = \frac{720}{5} = 144 \text{ almonds}
   \]
   So, the remaining almonds are:
   \[
   \text{Remaining almonds} = 720 - 144 = 576 \text{ almonds}
   \]

4. **Determine if the current capacity is enough**:
   The total capacity of the bowls and the remaining table is 240 almonds, but Carlos has 576 almonds. 
   Since 576 > 240, he does not have enough capacity.

5. **Calculate how many more bowls are needed**:
   First, we find out how many more almonds need to be accommodated:
   \[
   \text{Almonds that need to be accommodated} = 576 - 240 = 336 \text{ almonds}

     8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ skeins}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed overall.**
   - Total skeins for grandchildren and Keisha:
     \[
     164 + 16 = 180 \text{ skeins}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the skeins of wool.**
   - Each dozen skeins costs $7. First, we need to find out how many dozens are in 180 skeins:
     \[
     \frac{180}{12} = 15 \text{ dozens}
     \]
   - The cost for 15 dozens:
     \[
     15 \times 7 = 105 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Apply the discount if applicable.**
   - Since the total cost of $105 is over $100, Keisha qualifies for a $20 discount:
     \[
     105 - 20 = 85 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount Keisha should pay for all the skeins of wool she needs is **$85**.",85.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed for the grandchildren:**
   - For each grandchild, the wool needed is:
     - Shawl: 5 skeins
     - Sweater: 6 skeins
     - Poncho: 8 skeins
     - Gloves: 8 skeins
     - Mittens: 14 skeins
   - Total for one grandchild: 
     \( 5 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 14 = 41 \) skeins.
   - Since there are 4 grandchildren:
     \( 41 \times 4 = 164 \) skeins.

2. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed for Keisha:**
   - Keisha wants to make 2 jackets, each needing 8 skeins:
   - Total for jackets: 
     \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \) skeins.

3. **Calculate the overall total skeins of wool needed:**
   - Total skeins for grandchildren + Total skeins for Keisha:
   \( 164 + 16 = 180 \) skeins.

4. **Calculate the cost of the skeins of wool:**
   - Each dozen skeins costs $7. 
   - First, find out how many dozens are in 180 skeins:
   \( 180 \div 12 = 15 \) dozens.
   - Now, calculate the cost:
   \( 15 \times 7 = 105 \) dollars.

5. **Check if the discount applies:**
   - The total cost is $105, which is over $100, so Keisha gets a $20 discount.
   - Calculate the final cost after the discount:
   \( 105 - 20 = 85 \) dollars.

He has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 3 kgs of rice per day. The store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs; any additional rice is sold at the regular price. Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2. How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,"To find out how much Mohammed has to pay, we can break down the problem into several steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of rice Mohammed needs for a week:**
   - Mohammed uses 3 kg of rice per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he needs:
     \[
     3 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 21 \, \text{kg}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost of the more expensive brand of rice:**
   - The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg.
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more:
     \[
     \text{Cost of more expensive brand} = 15 + (0.20 \times 15) = 15 + 3 = ¥18 \, \text{per kg}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the first 10 kg of rice with the discount:**
   - The store has a 40% discount on the first 10 kg:
     \[
     \text{Discounted price per kg} = 18 - (0.40 \times 18) = 18 - 7.2 = ¥10.8 \, \text{per kg}
     \]
   - The cost for the first 10 kg:
     \[
     10 \, \text{kg} \times 10.8 = ¥108
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the remaining rice (11 kg) at regular price:**
   - The remaining rice needed is:
     \[
     21 \, \text{kg} - 10 \, \text{kg} = 11 \, \text{kg}
     \]
   - The cost for the remaining 11 kg at the regular price of ¥18 per kg:
     \[
     11 \, \text{kg} \times 18 = ¥198
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the rice:**
   - Total cost of rice:
     \[
     ¥108 + ¥198 = ¥306
     \]

6. **Add the cost of the bagel:**
   - The cost of the bagel is ¥2.
   - Total cost including the bagel:
     \[
     ¥306 + ¥2 = ¥308
     \]

Therefore, the total amount Mohammed has to pay is **¥308**.",308.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice:**
   - The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg.
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more.
   - 20% of ¥15 is \( 0.20 \times 15 = ¥3 \).
   - Therefore, the cost of the more expensive brand is \( 15 + 3 = ¥18 \) per kg.

2. **Calculate the total amount of rice Mohammed needs for a week:**
   - Mohammed uses 3 kgs of rice per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he needs \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) kgs of rice.

3. **Calculate the cost of the first 10 kgs of rice with the discount:**
   - The store has a 40% discount on the first 10 kgs.
   - The cost of 10 kgs at ¥18 per kg is \( 10 \times 18 = ¥180 \).
   - The discount is \( 40\% \) of ¥180, which is \( 0.40 \times 180 = ¥72 \).
   - Therefore, the cost after the discount for the first 10 kgs is \( 180 - 72 = ¥108 \).

4. **Calculate the cost of the remaining rice:**
   - Mohammed needs a total of 21 kgs, and he has already bought 10 kgs.
   - The remaining amount of rice he needs is \( 21 - 10 = 11 \) kgs.
   - The cost of these 11 kgs at the regular price of ¥18 per kg is \( 11 \times 18 = ¥198 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the rice:**
   - The total cost for the rice is the cost of the first 10 kgs plus the cost of the remaining 11 kgs:
   - Total cost = \( 108 + 198 = ¥306 \).

6. **Add the cost of the bagel:**
   - The cost of the bagel is ¥2.
   - Therefore, the total amount Mohammed has to pay is \( 306 + 2 = ¥308 \).

The answer is ¥308.",308.0,1,,308.0,1
gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Jasmine and Mia are sisters from Nairobi who love collecting signatures from authors. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Jasmine and Mia compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Jasmine has 36 signatures in her book, and Mia has 31. The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,"To find out how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week to reach their goal of 145 signatures, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total signatures they currently have:**
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   - Mia has 31 signatures.
   - Total signatures = 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

2. **Determine how many more signatures they need to reach their goal:**
   - Their goal is 145 signatures.
   - Signatures needed = 145 - 67 = 78 signatures.

3. **Determine Jasmine's collection over the next 2 weeks:**
   - Jasmine's current weekly collection is not explicitly given, but we know that she will collect 5 signatures less per week than she normally would.
   - Let's denote Jasmine's normal weekly collection as \( J \).
   - In the next 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect signatures only on weekends, which means she will collect \( J - 5 \) signatures each week.
   - Therefore, over 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect \( 2(J - 5) = 2J - 10 \) signatures.

4. **Determine Mia's collection over the next 2 weeks:**
   - Let Mia's weekly collection be \( M \).
   - Over 2 weeks, Mia will collect \( 2M \) signatures.

5. **Set up the equation for the total signatures collected in the next 2 weeks:**
   - The total signatures collected by both sisters in the next 2 weeks should equal the signatures they need to reach their goal:
   \[
   (2J - 10) + 2M = 78
   \]

6. **Rearranging the equation:**
   \[
   2J + 2M - 10 = 78
   \]
   \[
   2J + 2M = 88
   \]
   \[
   J + M = 44
   \]

7. **Determine Mia's required collection:**
   - We need to express \( M \) in terms of \( J \):
   \[
   M = 44 - J
   \]

8. **Substituting back to find Mia's collection:**
   - Since we know Jasmine's collection decreases by 5, we can assume a reasonable value for \( J \) to find \( M \). However, we need to ensure that \( J \) is a reasonable number that allows both sisters to reach their goal.
   - If we assume Jasmine's normal collection \( J \) is 25 (as an example), then:
   \[
   M = 44 - 25 = 19
   \]
   - This means Mia would need to collect 19 signatures per week.

9. **Check if this works:**
   - If Jasmine collects \( 25 - 5 = 20 \) signatures per week, then over 2 weeks she collects \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).
   - Mia collects \( 2 \times 19 = 38 \).
   - Total signatures collected in the next 2 weeks = \( 40 + 38 = 78 \).
   - Total signatures after 8 weeks = \( 67 + 78 = 145 \), which meets their goal.

Thus, Mia needs to collect **19 signatures per week** to ensure they reach their goal of 145 signatures by the end of the break.",145.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Current Signatures**: 
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   - Mia has 31 signatures.
   - Together, they have 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

2. **Goal**: 
   - They want to reach a total of 145 signatures.

3. **Signatures Needed**: 
   - To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the current total from their goal:
   - 145 - 67 = 78 signatures needed.

4. **Remaining Time**: 
   - They have 2 more weeks of spring break.

5. **Jasmine's Collection**: 
   - Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 signatures per week. 
   - Let's assume she originally collected \( x \) signatures per week. 
   - Therefore, in the remaining 2 weeks, she will collect:
   - (x - 5) + (x - 5) = 2(x - 5) = 2x - 10 signatures.

6. **Mia's Collection**: 
   - Let \( y \) be the number of signatures Mia collects per week.
   - In 2 weeks, Mia will collect:
   - y + y = 2y signatures.

7. **Total Signatures Collected in 2 Weeks**: 
   - The total signatures collected by both sisters in the remaining 2 weeks will be:
   - (2x - 10) + 2y.

8. **Setting Up the Equation**: 
   - We know they need a total of 78 more signatures, so we set up the equation:
   - (2x - 10) + 2y = 78.

9. **Solving for Mia's Collection**: 
   - Rearranging the equation gives us:
   - 2y = 78 - (2x - 10)
   - 2y = 78 - 2x + 10
   - 2y = 88 - 2x.

10. **Dividing by 2**: 
    - y = 44 - x.

11. **Conclusion**: 
    - Mia needs to collect \( 44 - x \) signatures per week, where \( x \) is Jasmine's original weekly collection. 
    - Since we don't have the exact value of \( x \), we can conclude that Mia's collection depends on Jasmine's original collection rate.

To ensure they reach their goal, Mia needs to collect \( 44 - x \) signatures per week, where \( x \) is Jasmine's original weekly collection.",44.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Jasmine currently has 36 signatures.
2. Mia currently has 31 signatures.
3. Together, they have collected: 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.
4. Their goal is to reach 145 signatures by the end of the break.
5. The number of signatures they still need to collect is: 145 - 67 = 78 signatures.
6. They have 2 weeks left to collect these signatures.
7. Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 signatures per week. Let's calculate how many signatures she will collect in the remaining weeks:
   - Normally, if Jasmine collected X signatures per week, in 2 weeks she would collect 2X signatures.
   - With the reduction, she will collect (X - 5) signatures per week, so in 2 weeks she will collect: 2 * (X - 5) = 2X - 10 signatures.
8. Therefore, the total signatures collected by Jasmine in 2 weeks will be: 2X - 10.
9. Mia needs to collect the remaining signatures to reach their goal. Let’s denote Mia's weekly collection as Y signatures per week. In 2 weeks, she will collect: 2Y signatures.
10. The total signatures collected by both sisters in the remaining 2 weeks will be: (2X - 10) + 2Y.
11. We want this total to equal the remaining signatures needed: (2X - 10) + 2Y = 78.
12. Rearranging the equation gives us: 2Y = 78 - (2X - 10).
13. Simplifying this, we get: 2Y = 78 - 2X + 10, which simplifies to: 2Y = 88 - 2X.
14. Dividing everything by 2 gives us: Y = 44 - X.

Now, Mia needs to collect Y signatures per week. Since we don't know Jasmine's original weekly collection (X), we can express Mia's required collection in terms of X.

The answer is that Mia needs to collect (44 - X) signatures per week, where X is Jasmine's original weekly collection.",44.0,0

He makes 48 total ice cubes, including 10 giant cubes, 14 small cubes, 12 medium cubes, and some tiny cubes. How many ounces of water does Leon have left?",122.0,"To find out how many ounces of water Leon has left after making the ice cubes, we first need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of ice cube he made.

1. **Calculate the water used for giant cubes:**
   - Number of giant cubes = 10
   - Water used per giant cube = 12 ounces
   - Total water used for giant cubes = \(10 \times 12 = 120\) ounces

2. **Calculate the water used for medium cubes:**
   - Number of medium cubes = 12
   - Water used per medium cube = 5 ounces
   - Total water used for medium cubes = \(12 \times 5 = 60\) ounces

   - Number of small cubes = 14
   - Water used per small cube = 0.5 ounces
   - Total water used for small cubes = \(14 \times 0.5 = 7\) ounces

4. **Now, we need to find the total water used for all the cubes made so far:**
   \[
   \text{Total water used} = \text{Water for giant cubes} + \text{Water for medium cubes} + \text{Water for small cubes}

4. **Determine the number of students who like to play video games:**
   - The total number of students in the class is 160. Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is:
     \[
     \text{Number of students who like to play video games} = 160 - 152 = 8
     \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of students who like to play video games:**
   - To find the percentage, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of students who like to play video games}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values we have:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{8}{160} \right) \times 100 = 5\%
     \]

Thus, the percentage of students who like to play video games is \( \boxed{5\%} \).",5.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. We start with a class of 160 students.
2. The number of students who like to hike is 69.
3. The number of students who like to play chess is 8.
4. The number of students who like to swim is 13.
5. The number of students who like to play football is 13.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who have specified hobbies:

- Total students with specified hobbies = 69 (hike) + 8 (chess) + 13 (swim) + 13 (football)
- Total students with specified hobbies = 69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103

Next, we find out how many students are left who like either to play video games or bake:

- Students who like video games or bake = Total students - Students with specified hobbies
- Students who like video games or bake = 160 - 103 = 57

Now, we need to find out how many students like to bake. We know that the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number of students who like to play football:

- Number of students who like to play football = 13
- Four times the number of students who like to play football = 4 * 13 = 52
- Therefore, the number of students who like to bake = 52 - 3 = 49

Now, we can find the number of students who like to play video games:

- Students who like video games = Students who like video games or bake - Students who like to bake
- Students who like video games = 57 - 49 = 8

Finally, we calculate the percentage of students who like to play video games:

- Percentage of students who like to play video games = (Number of students who like video games / Total students) * 100
- Percentage of students who like to play video games = (8 / 160) * 100 = 5%

His friends have chipped in and will cover the cost of all the food for the workshop. Oliver has also applied for help from the local charity, which has decided to cover 1/10 of the remaining cost of the workshop. How much money is Oliver still missing?",113.0,"To determine how much money Oliver is still missing, we first need to calculate the total cost of the workshop for the 2 days.

1. **Calculate the total cost for each day:**
   - Hotel cost per day: ₣100
   - Food cost per day: ₣20 (but his friends will cover this)
   - Transportation cost per day: ₣10

   Total cost per day (excluding food):
   \[
   \text{Total cost per day} = \text{Hotel} + \text{Transportation} = 100 + 10 = ₣110
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost for 2 days:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 2 days} = 2 \times \text{Total cost per day} = 2 \times 110 = ₣220
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost covered by his friends:**
   Since his friends are covering the food cost, we need to calculate the total food cost for 2 days:
   \[
   \text{Total food cost for 2 days} = 2 \times 20 = ₣40
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining cost after food is covered:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining cost} = \text{Total cost for 2 days} - \text{Total food cost} = 220 - 40 = ₣180
   \]

5. **Calculate the amount covered by the local charity:**
   The charity covers \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the remaining cost:
   \[
   \text{Charity contribution} = \frac{1}{10} \times 180 = ₣18

6. **Calculate the total amount Oliver needs to cover:**
   \[
   \text{Amount Oliver needs to cover} = \text{Remaining cost} - \text{Charity contribution} = 180 - 18 = ₣162

7. **Calculate how much money Oliver is still missing:**
   Oliver currently has ₣85, so we find out how much more he needs:
   \[
   \text{Amount missing} = \text{Amount Oliver needs to cover} - \text{Amount Oliver has} = 162 - 85 = ₣77
   \]

Thus, Oliver is still missing **₣77**.",77.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost for one day:**
   - Hotel cost: ₣100
   - Food cost: ₣20 (covered by friends)
   - Transportation cost: ₣10
   - Total cost for one day = Hotel + Food + Transportation = ₣100 + ₣20 + ₣10 = ₣130

2. **Calculate the total cost for two days:**
   - Total cost for two days = 2 * Total cost for one day = 2 * ₣130 = ₣260

3. **Determine the remaining cost after food is covered:**
   - Since the food cost for both days is covered by friends, we only need to consider the hotel and transportation costs.
   - Total cost for hotel and transportation for two days = 2 * (Hotel + Transportation) = 2 * (₣100 + ₣10) = 2 * ₣110 = ₣220

4. **Calculate the amount covered by the charity:**
   - The charity covers 1/10 of the remaining cost (₣220).
   - Amount covered by charity = ₣220 * (1/10) = ₣22

5. **Calculate the remaining cost after charity contribution:**
   - Remaining cost after charity = Total remaining cost - Amount covered by charity = ₣220 - ₣22 = ₣198

6. **Determine how much money Oliver has:**
   - Oliver has ₣85.

7. **Calculate how much more money Oliver needs:**

1. **Cost of a loaf of bread**: 
   \[
   \text{Cost of 1 loaf} = €5
   \]

2. **Cost of a bagel**: 
   Since the cost of a bagel is one-fourth of a loaf of bread:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 1 bagel} = \frac{1}{4} \times €5 = €1.25

4. **Check for discount**: 
   The bakery has a promotion that gives a 20% discount on bagels if you buy 7 or more. Since we are buying 8 bagels, we qualify for the discount.

5. **Calculate the discount**: 
   The discount amount on 8 bagels is:

Jamal starts with $80 and wants 10 gallons of paint, each priced at $7.0, and 3 carpenter pencils, each costing $2. The store offers a 10% discount on paint for members. How much more money does Elena have left than Jamal after they leave the store?",8.0,"To find out how much more money Elena has left than Jamal after they leave the store, we need to calculate the total expenses for both Elena and Jamal and then determine their remaining balances.

### Step 1: Calculate Elena's total expenses

1. **Cost of anchors**:
   - Price per anchor = $0.26
   - Number of anchors = 15
   - Total cost for anchors = \( 15 \times 0.26 = 3.90 \)

2. **Cost of nails**:
   - Price per nail = $0.61
   - Number of nails = 9
   - Total cost for nails = \( 9 \times 0.61 = 5.49 \)

3. **Cost of paint**:
   - Price per gallon of paint = $7.00
   - Number of gallons = 10
   - Total cost for paint = \( 10 \times 7.00 = 70.00 \)

4. **Total cost for Elena**:
   - Total cost = Cost of anchors + Cost of nails + Cost of paint
   - Total cost = \( 3.90 + 5.49 + 70.00 = 79.39 \)

5. **Remaining balance for Elena**:
   - Initial amount = $98.39
   - Remaining balance = Initial amount - Total cost
   - Remaining balance = \( 98.39 - 79.39 = 19.00 \)

### Step 2: Calculate Jamal's total expenses

1. **Cost of paint** (with discount):
   - Price per gallon of paint = $7.00
   - Number of gallons = 10
   - Total cost for paint before discount = \( 10 \times 7.00 = 70.00 \)
   - Discount = 10% of $70.00 = \( 0.10 \times 70.00 = 7.00 \)
   - Total cost for paint after discount = \( 70.00 - 7.00 = 63.00 \)

2. **Cost of carpenter pencils**:
   - Price per pencil = $2.00
   - Number of pencils = 3
   - Total cost for pencils = \( 3 \times 2.00 = 6.00 \)

3. **Total cost for Jamal**:
   - Total cost = Cost of paint + Cost of pencils
   - Total cost = \( 63.00 + 6.00 = 69.00 \)

4. **Remaining balance for Jamal**:
   - Initial amount = $80.00
   - Remaining balance = Initial amount - Total cost
   - Remaining balance = \( 80.00 - 69.00 = 11.00 \)

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in remaining balances

1. **Difference in remaining balances**:
   - Difference = Elena's remaining balance - Jamal's remaining balance
   - Difference = \( 19.00 - 11.00 = 8.00 \)

### Conclusion

Elena has **$8.00** more than Jamal after they leave the store.",8.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate Elena's total expenses.**

- **Cost of anchors:**
  Each anchor costs $0.26, and Elena wants to buy 15 anchors.
  \[
  \text{Total cost of anchors} = 15 \times 0.26 = 3.90
  \]

- **Cost of nails:**
  Each nail costs $0.61, and Elena needs 9 nails.
  \[
  \text{Total cost of nails} = 9 \times 0.61 = 5.49

The crayon box has 12 different colors of crayon, and the sticker book has 6 pages, each with 12 stickers. The tower of stacking rings has 29 multicolored rings on it. Gabrielle recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of items for her nephew up to 320. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?",63.0,"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we first need to calculate the total number of items Gabrielle already has before adding the bouncy balls.

1. **Building Blocks**: 43 blocks
2. **Stuffed Animals**: 5 stuffed animals
3. **Action Figures**: The number of action figures is twice the number of blocks and stuffed animals combined. 
   - First, we calculate the total number of blocks and stuffed animals:
     \[
     43 + 5 = 48
     \]
   - Now, we find the number of action figures:
     \[
     2 \times 48 = 96 \text{ action figures}
     \]
4. **Crayons**: 12 different colors of crayon
5. **Stickers**: The sticker book has 6 pages, each with 12 stickers. So, the total number of stickers is:
   \[
   6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ stickers}
   \]
6. **Stacking Rings**: 29 multicolored rings

Now, we can sum all these items to find the total number of items Gabrielle has before adding the bouncy balls:

\[
\text{Total items} = \text{Building Blocks} + \text{Stuffed Animals} + \text{Action Figures} + \text{Crayons} + \text{Stickers} + \text{Stacking Rings}

- \(43 + 5 = 48\)
- \(48 + 96 = 144\)
- \(144 + 12 = 156\)
- \(156 + 72 = 228\)
- \(228 + 29 = 257\)

So, Gabrielle has a total of 257 items before adding the bouncy balls.

Now, we know that the total number of items after adding the bouncy balls is 320. Let \(x\) be the number of bouncy balls. We can set up the equation:

\[
257 + x = 320
\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 257 from both sides:

\[
x = 320 - 257

2. Next, we find the number of action figures.
   - The number of action figures is twice the number of blocks and stuffed animals combined.
   - So, the number of action figures is 2 * 48 = 96.

3. Now, we will calculate the total number of crayons.
   - The crayon box has 12 different colors of crayon.
   - So, the total number of crayons is 12.

   \text{Total occupied or out of service} = \text{Occupied rooms} + \text{Rooms out of service} = 475 + 475 = 950 \text{ rooms}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms:**
   The total number of unoccupied rooms is the total capacity minus the rooms that are occupied or out of service.
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied rooms} = \text{Total capacity} - \text{Total occupied or out of service} = 1900 - 950 = 950 \text{ rooms}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of patients admitted over 3 weeks:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so in 3 weeks, there are:
   \[
   \text{Total days} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days}
   \]
   With 20 patients admitted each day:
   \[
   \text{Total patients admitted} = 20 \times 21 = 420 \text{ patients}
   \]

6. **Calculate the new number of occupied rooms:**
   The new number of occupied rooms will be the original occupied rooms plus the patients admitted.
   \[
   \text{New occupied rooms} = \text{Original occupied rooms} + \text{Total patients admitted} = 475 + 420 = 895 \text{ rooms}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks:**
   Now we need to recalculate the unoccupied rooms considering the new number of occupied rooms.
   \[
   \text{Total occupied or out of service} = \text{New occupied rooms} + \text{Rooms out of service} = 895 + 475 = 1370 \text{ rooms}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks} = \text{Total capacity} - \text{Total occupied or out of service} = 1900 - 1370 = 530 \text{ rooms}
   \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks is **530 rooms**.",530.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. The total capacity of the care facility is 1900 rooms.
2. One-fourth of the rooms are occupied. To find the number of occupied rooms, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Occupied rooms} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475 \text{ rooms}
   \]
3. One-fourth of all the rooms are out of service. To find the number of rooms out of service, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Out of service rooms} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475 \text{ rooms}
   \]
4. Now, we can find the total number of rooms that are either occupied or out of service:
   \[
   \text{Total occupied and out of service} = 475 + 475 = 950 \text{ rooms}
   \]
5. To find the number of unoccupied rooms, we subtract the total occupied and out of service rooms from the total capacity:
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied rooms} = 1900 - 950 = 950 \text{ rooms}
   \]
6. Next, we need to account for the 20 patients admitted each day for 3 weeks. First, we calculate the total number of days in 3 weeks:
   \[
   \text{Total days} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days}
   \]
7. Now, we calculate the total number of patients admitted in 3 weeks:
   \[
   \text{Total patients admitted} = 20 \times 21 = 420 \text{ patients}
   \]
8. Since these patients will occupy rooms, we need to subtract the number of patients from the unoccupied rooms:
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied rooms after admissions} = 950 - 420 = 530 \text{ rooms}
   \]

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Faisal is selling muffins and apricot pies for a fundraiser. On Wednesday, he sold 27 boxes of muffin and 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie, than on Thursday. On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday and 21 boxes of apricot pie. On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?",796.0,"To find Faisal's average daily earning, we first need to determine how many boxes of muffins and apricot pies he sold on each day.

### Step 1: Determine the sales on Wednesday
Let:
- \( m_W \) = boxes of muffins sold on Wednesday
- \( p_W \) = boxes of apricot pies sold on Wednesday

From the problem, we know:
- \( m_W = 27 \)
- \( p_W = m_W - 13 = 27 - 13 = 14 \)

### Step 2: Determine the sales on Thursday
Let:
- \( m_T \) = boxes of muffins sold on Thursday
- \( p_T \) = boxes of apricot pies sold on Thursday

From the problem, we know:
- \( m_T = m_W + 11 = 27 + 11 = 38 \)
- \( p_T = 21 \)

### Step 3: Determine the sales on Friday
Let:
- \( m_F \) = boxes of muffins sold on Friday
- \( p_F \) = boxes of apricot pies sold on Friday

From the problem, we know that on Friday he sold as much as he did on Wednesday and Thursday combined:
- Total muffins sold on Wednesday and Thursday = \( m_W + m_T = 27 + 38 = 65 \)
- Total apricot pies sold on Wednesday and Thursday = \( p_W + p_T = 14 + 21 = 35 \)

Thus, on Friday:
- \( m_F = 65 \)
- \( p_F = 35 \)

### Step 4: Calculate total sales for each day
Now we can summarize the sales:
- **Wednesday**: 
  - Muffins: 27
  - Apricot pies: 14
- **Thursday**: 
  - Muffins: 38
  - Apricot pies: 21
- **Friday**: 
  - Muffins: 65
  - Apricot pies: 35

### Step 5: Calculate total earnings for each day
Now we calculate the earnings for each day using the prices:
- Price of muffins = ₺9
- Price of apricot pies = ₺21

**Wednesday Earnings**:
\[
\text{Earnings}_W = (m_W \times 9) + (p_W \times 21) = (27 \times 9) + (14 \times 21) = 243 + 294 = 537
\]

**Thursday Earnings**:
\[
\text{Earnings}_T = (m_T \times 9) + (p_T \times 21) = (38 \times 9) + (21 \times 21) = 342 + 441 = 783
\]

**Friday Earnings**:
\[
\text{Earnings}_F = (m_F \times 9) + (p_F \times 21) = (65 \times 9) + (35 \times 21) = 585 + 735 = 1320
\]

### Step 6: Calculate total earnings over the three days
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Earnings}_W + \text{Earnings}_T + \text{Earnings}_F = 537 + 783 + 1320 = 2640
\]

### Step 7: Calculate average daily earnings
Since Faisal sold items over 3 days, we calculate the average:
\[
\text{Average Daily Earnings} = \frac{\text{Total Earnings}}{3} = \frac{2640}{3} = 880
\]

Thus, Faisal's average daily earning is **₺880**.",880.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the number of boxes sold on Wednesday:**
   - Faisal sold 27 boxes of muffins on Wednesday.
   - He sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pies than on Thursday. 

2. **Determine the number of boxes sold on Thursday:**
   - On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday.
   - So, the number of muffins sold on Thursday is:
     \[
     27 + 11 = 38 \text{ boxes}
     \]
   - He sold 21 boxes of apricot pies on Thursday.

3. **Calculate the number of apricot pies sold on Wednesday:**
   - Since he sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pies on Wednesday than on Thursday:

     342 + 441 = 783 \text{ ₺}
     \]

   - **Earnings on Friday:**
     - Total boxes sold on Friday: 94 boxes.
     - Since he sold muffins and apricot pies in the same ratio as the previous days, we need to find the ratio of muffins to apricot pies sold over the two days.
     - Total muffins sold in two days: \(27 + 38 = 65\)
     - Total apricot pies sold in two days: \(8 + 21 = 29\)
     - Total boxes sold in two days: \(35 + 59 = 94\)
     - Ratio of muffins to total boxes: 
     \[
     \frac{65}{94} \text{ and apricot pies: } \frac{29}{94}

How many minutes will it take her to peel and saute 150 clams if it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam before peeling it? Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.,163.0,"To determine how long it will take Olga to peel and sauté 150 clams, we need to break down the tasks into their respective times and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the time to wash the clams
Olga needs to wash each clam before peeling it, and it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam. 

For 150 clams:
\[
\text{Time to wash} = 150 \text{ clams} \times 12 \text{ seconds/clams} = 1800 \text{ seconds}
\]

Convert seconds to minutes:
\[
1800 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time to peel the clams
Olga can peel 6 clams per minute. 

For 150 clams:
\[
\text{Time to peel} = \frac{150 \text{ clams}}{6 \text{ clams/minute}} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the break time
After peeling, Olga takes a 13-minute break.

### Step 4: Calculate the time to sauté the clams
Olga can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes. 

To find out how long it takes to sauté 150 clams, we first determine how many batches of 30 clams are in 150 clams:
\[
\text{Number of batches} = \frac{150 \text{ clams}}{30 \text{ clams/batch}} = 5 \text{ batches}
\]

Now, calculate the total time to sauté 150 clams:
\[
\text{Time to sauté} = 5 \text{ batches} \times 19 \text{ minutes/batch} = 95 \text{ minutes}

### Step 5: Total time calculation
Now, we sum all the times:
- Time to wash: 30 minutes
- Time to peel: 25 minutes
- Break time: 13 minutes
- Time to sauté: 95 minutes

Total time:
\[
\text{Total time} = 30 + 25 + 13 + 95 = 163 \text{ minutes}

   - Total time now becomes:
     \[
     55 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 68 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Calculate the time to sauté 150 clams:**
   - It takes 19 minutes to sauté 30 clams.
   - To find the time to sauté 150 clams, first determine how many batches of 30 clams are in 150 clams:
     \[
     150 \text{ clams} \div 30 \text{ clams/batch} = 5 \text{ batches}

   Let's calculate that:
   \[
   177 + 183 = 360
   \]
   \[
   360 + 354 = 714
   \]
   \[
   714 + 357 = 1071
   \]
   So, Andre picked a total of 1071 pineapples from Saturday to Tuesday.

5. **Boxes of pineapples:**
   - Each box contains 21 pineapples. To find out how many boxes Andre can sell:
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{1071}{21}
   \]
   Let's calculate that:
   \[
   1071 \div 21 = 51
   \]
   (since \(21 \times 51 = 1071\))

6. **Total earnings from selling the boxes:**
   - Each box sells for $8:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 51 \times 8
   \]
   Let's calculate that:
   \[
   51 \times 8 = 408
   \]

Therefore, Andre is going to make **$408**.",408.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. On Saturday, Andre picks 177 pineapples.
2. On Sunday, he picks 183 pineapples.
3. On Monday, he picks double the number of pineapples he did on Saturday:
   - So, on Monday, he picks 2 * 177 = 354 pineapples.
4. Now, let's calculate the total number of pineapples picked over the three days:
   - Total = 177 (Saturday) + 183 (Sunday) + 354 (Monday) = 714 pineapples.
5. On Tuesday, he picks half the amount of what he picked in the past 3 days combined:
   - So, on Tuesday, he picks 714 / 2 = 357 pineapples.
6. Now, let's calculate the total number of pineapples Andre has after Tuesday:
   - Total pineapples = 177 + 183 + 354 + 357 = 1071 pineapples.
7. On Wednesday, Andre is going to sell pineapples in boxes of 21 pineapples each:
   - The number of boxes he can sell = 1071 / 21 = 51 boxes (since 1071 divided by 21 equals 51 with no remainder).
8. Each box is sold for $8:
   - Total money made = 51 boxes * $8 = $408.

The answer is $408.",408.0,1,,408.0,1

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 50% for the second half. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?",1755.0,"To find out how many pizzas the family eats in two months, we will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the daily pizza consumption of each family member.

- Uncle: 10 pizzas/day
- Spouse: 20 pizzas/day

**Combined consumption of uncle and spouse:**
\[
10 + 20 = 30 \text{ pizzas/day}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the grandchild's pizza consumption.

The grandchild eats two-fourths (which is equivalent to one-half) of the combined number of pizzas eaten by the uncle and spouse.

**Grandchild's consumption:**
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ pizzas/day}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total daily consumption for the family.

**Total daily consumption:**
\[
10 + 20 + 15 = 45 \text{ pizzas/day}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total consumption for the first month.

Assuming one month has 30 days, the total consumption for the first month is:
\[
45 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 1350 \text{ pizzas}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the consumption for the second month.

#### First half of the second month (15 days):

They reduce their consumption by 60%. 

**New daily consumption:**
\[
45 \text{ pizzas/day} \times (1 - 0.60) = 45 \times 0.40 = 18 \text{ pizzas/day}
\]

**Total for the first half of the second month:**
\[
18 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 270 \text{ pizzas}
\]

#### Second half of the second month (15 days):

They further reduce their consumption by 50% from the already reduced amount.

**New daily consumption for the second half:**
\[
18 \text{ pizzas/day} \times (1 - 0.50) = 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \text{ pizzas/day}
\]

**Total for the second half of the second month:**
\[
9 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ pizzas}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total consumption for the second month.

**Total for the second month:**
\[
270 \text{ pizzas} + 135 \text{ pizzas} = 405 \text{ pizzas}
\]

### Step 7: Calculate the total consumption for both months.

**Total for both months:**
\[
1350 \text{ pizzas} + 405 \text{ pizzas} = 1755 \text{ pizzas}

   - The grandchild eats two-fourths (which is the same as 1/2) of the combined number of pizzas:
     \[
     \text{Grandchild's consumption} = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ pizzas}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total daily pizza consumption for the family is:
     \[
     30 + 15 = 45 \text{ pizzas}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total consumption for the first month:**
   - There are 30 days in a month.
   - The total number of pizzas eaten in the first month is:
     \[
     45 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 1350 \text{ pizzas}
     \]

3. **Calculate the consumption for the second month:**
   - For the first half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by 60%:
     - The reduced consumption is:
     \[
     45 \text{ pizzas} \times (1 - 0.60) = 45 \times 0.40 = 18 \text{ pizzas/day}

1. **Total capacity of the Sports Arena**: 9600 seats
2. **Seats reserved for graduates**: 700 seats
3. **Seats reserved for faculty**: 450 seats
4. **Seats reserved for staff**: 50 seats

Now, we can calculate the total number of seats that are reserved:

\[
\text{Total reserved seats} = \text{Seats for graduates} + \text{Seats for faculty} + \text{Seats for staff}

\[
\text{Total reserved seats} = 700 + 450 + 50 = 1200 \text{ seats}

Now, we need to determine how many graduates there are. Since each graduate will receive tickets to distribute to their friends and family, we need to know the number of graduates. The problem states that there are 700 graduates.

Finally, we can calculate how many tickets each graduate can receive by dividing the available seats for guests by the number of graduates:

\[
\text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{\text{Available seats for guests}}{\text{Number of graduates}}

Next, we subtract the reserved seats from the total capacity:  
9600 - 1200 = 8400 seats available for tickets.  

Now, we need to determine how many graduates there are. Since the problem does not specify the number of graduates, we will assume that the number of graduates is equal to the number of reserved seats for graduates, which is 700.  

To find out how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we divide the available seats by the number of graduates:  
8400 / 700 = 12 tickets per graduate.

2. **Determine how many emails Mohammed can respond to:**
   - Mohammed can respond to 2 less than half of the emails that require a response.
   - Half of the emails that require a response is:

gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Ananya walks 24 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 miles of walking on the beach and 14 miles of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?",85.0,"To solve the problem, we need to determine Ananya's walking speeds and the time taken for each segment of her walk.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( r \) be Ananya's original speed on the beach (in miles per hour).
   - Then her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2r \) (since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk).

2. **Injury Impact:**
   - After her injury, her speed on the beach becomes \( \frac{r}{2} \) and her speed on the sidewalk becomes \( \frac{2r}{2} = r \).

3. **Time Spent on the Beach:**
   - We know that Ananya spends 50 minutes walking on the beach. To convert this to hours, we have:
     \[
     \text{Time on beach} = \frac{50}{60} = \frac{5}{6} \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Distance on the Beach:**
   - The distance she walks on the beach is 10 miles. Using the formula for distance, \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \), we can express the distance walked on the beach as:
     \[
     10 = \left(\frac{r}{2}\right) \times \frac{5}{6}
     \]
   - Solving for \( r \):
     \[
     10 = \frac{5r}{12}
     \]
     \[
     120 = 5r
     \]
     \[
     r = 24 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

5. **Speed After Injury:**
   - After her injury, her speed on the beach is:
     \[
     \frac{r}{2} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]
   - Her speed on the sidewalk is:
     \[
     r = 24 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

6. **Time Spent on the Sidewalk:**
   - The distance she walks on the sidewalk is 14 miles. Using the speed after her injury, the time spent walking on the sidewalk is:
     \[
     \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{14}{24} \text{ hours}

   - Converting this to minutes:
     \[
     \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{14}{24} \times 60 = \frac{14 \times 60}{24} = \frac{840}{24} = 35 \text{ minutes}
     \]

7. **Total Time for the Walk:**
   - The total time for the entire 24-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 50 \text{ minutes} + 35 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes}

1. Ananya walks a total of 24 miles every day, which includes 10 miles on the beach and 14 miles on the sidewalk.

2. We know that Ananya spends 50 minutes walking on the beach. 

3. Let's determine her speed on the beach. Since she walks 10 miles in 50 minutes, we can calculate her speed on the beach:
   - Speed on the beach = Distance / Time = 10 miles / (50 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) = 10 miles / (5/6 hours) = 10 * (6/5) = 12 miles per hour.

4. Since Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, her speed on the sidewalk before her injury would be:
   - Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * Speed on the beach = 2 * 12 miles per hour = 24 miles per hour.

5. However, due to her injury, her speed has decreased by half. Therefore, her new speeds are:
   - New speed on the beach = 12 miles per hour / 2 = 6 miles per hour.
   - New speed on the sidewalk = 24 miles per hour / 2 = 12 miles per hour.

6. Now, let's calculate the time it takes for her to walk the remaining 14 miles on the sidewalk at her new speed:
   - Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 14 miles / 12 miles per hour = 14 / 12 hours = 7/6 hours.

7. To convert this time into minutes:
   - Time on the sidewalk in minutes = (7/6 hours) * 60 minutes/hour = 70 minutes.

8. Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the entire 24-mile walk:
   - Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk = 50 minutes + 70 minutes = 120 minutes.

4. However, due to her injury, her speed has decreased by half. So, her new speed on the beach is:
   - New speed on the beach = 12 miles per hour / 2 = 6 miles per hour.
5. Now, let's calculate how long it takes her to walk the 10 miles on the beach at her new speed:
   - Time on the beach = Distance / Speed = 10 miles / 6 miles per hour = 10/6 hours = 5/3 hours = (5/3) * 60 minutes = 100 minutes.
6. Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, her speed on the sidewalk before the injury was:

7. After her injury, her new speed on the sidewalk is:
   - New speed on the sidewalk = 24 miles per hour / 2 = 12 miles per hour.
8. Now, let's calculate how long it takes her to walk the 14 miles on the sidewalk at her new speed:
   - Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 14 miles / 12 miles per hour = 14/12 hours = 7/6 hours = (7/6) * 60 minutes = 70 minutes.
9. Finally, we add the time spent walking on the beach and the time spent walking on the sidewalk to find the total time for her 24-mile walk:
   - Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk = 100 minutes + 70 minutes = 170 minutes.

   11 \text{ dozen} = 11 \times 12 = 132 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. **Cookies eaten by Amelia**: She ate 5 cookies for breakfast.
   \[
   132 - 5 = 127 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. **Cookies hidden in the yard**: After eating, Amelia hid 127 cookies in the yard.

4. **Cookies found by Elena**: Elena finds 5 cookies.
   \[
   \text{Elena's cookies} = 5
   \]

5. **Cookies found by Mei**: Mei finds twice as many as Elena.
   \[
   \text{Mei's cookies} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

6. **Cookies found by Xavier**: Xavier finds 2 less than Mei.
   \[
   \text{Xavier's cookies} = 10 - 2 = 8
   \]

7. **Cookies found by Mohammed**: Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier.
   \[
   \text{Mohammed's cookies} = \frac{8}{8} = 1
   \]

8. **Cookies found by Umar**: Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined.
   - First, calculate the total cookies found by Mei and Elena:
   \[
   \text{Mei's cookies} + \text{Elena's cookies} = 10 + 5 = 15
   \]
   - Now, calculate Umar's cookies:
   \[
   \text{Umar's cookies} = 15 + 2 \times 12 = 15 + 24 = 39

Thus, the number of cookies still hidden in the yard is \(\boxed{64}\).",64.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Amelia initially had 11 dozen cookies. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we calculate the total number of cookies:
   \[
   11 \text{ dozen} = 11 \times 12 = 132 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. Amelia ate 5 cookies for breakfast. We subtract the cookies she ate from the total:
   \[
   132 - 5 = 127 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. Now, 127 cookies are hidden in the yard.

4. Elena finds 5 cookies. We subtract this from the total hidden:
   \[
   127 - 5 = 122 \text{ cookies left}
   \]

5. Mei finds twice as many cookies as Elena. Since Elena found 5 cookies:
   \[
   Mei = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cookies}
   \]

6. Now we subtract Mei's cookies from the total:
   \[
   122 - 10 = 112 \text{ cookies left}
   \]

7. Xavier finds 2 less than Mei. Since Mei found 10 cookies:
   \[
   Xavier = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ cookies}
   \]

8. We subtract Xavier's cookies from the total:
   \[
   112 - 8 = 104 \text{ cookies left}
   \]

9. Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier. Since Xavier found 8 cookies:
   \[
   Mohammed = \frac{8}{8} = 1 \text{ cookie}
   \]

10. We subtract Mohammed's cookies from the total:
    \[
    104 - 1 = 103 \text{ cookies left}
    \]

11. Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined. First, we calculate how many cookies Mei and Elena found together:
    \[
    \text{Mei} + \text{Elena} = 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ cookies}
    \]
    Now, two dozen is:
    \[
    2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ cookies}
    \]
    So, Umar finds:
    \[
    Umar = 15 + 24 = 39 \text{ cookies}

However, this week, 9 apartments from each of the first 2 complexes were vacant and did not require collection service. Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each place and he gets paid ₣0.5 per collection for each apartment. He also earns an additional 10% in tips. How much money does he make in a week?",1243.0,"To calculate how much money Oscar makes in a week, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of apartments in each complex.**
   - The first two complexes each have 100 apartments:
     \[
     \text{Apartments in first complex} = 100
     \]
     \[
     \text{Apartments in second complex} = 100
     \]
   - The third complex is 35% bigger than the first two combined:
     \[
     \text{Total apartments in first two complexes} = 100 + 100 = 200

     \[
     \text{Apartments in third complex} = 200 + 0.35 \times 200 = 200 + 70 = 270
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of apartments Oscar services this week.**
   - For the first two complexes, 9 apartments are vacant in each:
     \[
     \text{Occupied apartments in first complex} = 100 - 9 = 91
     \]
     \[
     \text{Occupied apartments in second complex} = 100 - 9 = 91

Thus, Oscar makes **₣1243** in a week.",1243.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of apartments in the first two complexes:**
   - The first complex has 100 apartments.
   - The second complex also has 100 apartments.
   - So, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is 100 + 100 = 200 apartments.

2. **Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex:**
   - The third complex is 35% bigger than the first two combined.
   - The size of the first two combined is 200 apartments.
   - 35% of 200 is calculated as follows: 
     \[
     0.35 \times 200 = 70
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is:
     \[
     200 + 70 = 270 \text{ apartments}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of apartments:**
   - Total apartments = apartments in first complex + apartments in second complex + apartments in third complex
   - Total apartments = 100 + 100 + 270 = 470 apartments.

4. **Account for the vacant apartments:**
   - There are 9 vacant apartments in the first complex and 9 in the second complex.
   - Total vacant apartments = 9 + 9 = 18 apartments.
   - Therefore, the number of apartments requiring collection service is:
     \[
     470 - 18 = 452 \text{ apartments}

2. For the next 30 minutes (from minute 11 to minute 40), the cost is ₺0.7 per minute.
   - Cost for the next 30 minutes = 30 minutes * ₺0.7/minute = ₺21.0.

3. For the last 20 minutes (from minute 41 to minute 60), the cost is ₺0.1 per two minutes.
   - Since there are 20 minutes, we can calculate how many two-minute intervals are in 20 minutes: 20 minutes / 2 minutes = 10 intervals.
   - Cost for the last 20 minutes = 10 intervals * ₺0.1/interval = ₺1.0.

   - Originally, it took 6 minutes per room.
   - Due to the injury, it now takes twice as long:
     \[
     \text{New time per room} = 6 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 12 \text{ minutes}

3. **Convert total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

   \[
   \text{Daily cleaning time} = \frac{40 \text{ hours}}{5 \text{ days}} = 8 \text{ hours per day}

1. **Identify the number of white bricks**: 
   - There are 5 white bricks.

2. **Determine the number of orange bricks**: 
   - The problem states there are twice as many orange bricks as white bricks. Therefore, the number of orange bricks is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ orange bricks}

7. So, the percentage of green bricks is (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.  

The answer is 50%.",50.0,1,,50.0,1
gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Olivia, Bodhi are currently 24 years apart in age. Olivia and Keisha are currently 15 years apart. Olivia, who is younger than Bodhi but older than Keisha, will be 42 in 7 years. How much younger is Keisha than the average age of all three?",18.0,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Olivia, Bodhi, and Keisha based on the information provided.

1. **Determine Olivia's current age:**
   - Olivia will be 42 in 7 years.
   - Therefore, her current age is:
     \[
     42 - 7 = 35 \text{ years old}
     \]

2. **Determine Bodhi's current age:**
   - Olivia is currently 35 years old and is younger than Bodhi by 24 years.
   - Therefore, Bodhi's current age is:
     \[
     35 + 24 = 59 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Determine Keisha's current age:**
   - Olivia is currently 35 years old and is older than Keisha by 15 years.
   - Therefore, Keisha's current age is:
     \[
     35 - 15 = 20 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Calculate the average age of Olivia, Bodhi, and Keisha:**
   - The sum of their ages is:
     \[
     35 + 59 + 20 = 114
     \]
   - The average age is:
     \[
     \frac{114}{3} = 38 \text{ years old}
     \]

5. **Determine how much younger Keisha is than the average age:**
   - The difference between the average age and Keisha's age is:
     \[
     38 - 20 = 18
     \]

Thus, Keisha is **18 years younger** than the average age of all three.",18.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine Olivia's current age**: 
   - In 7 years, Olivia will be 42 years old. 
   - Therefore, her current age is 42 - 7 = 35 years old.

2. **Determine Bodhi's current age**: 
   - Olivia is currently 24 years younger than Bodhi. 
   - So, Bodhi's current age is 35 + 24 = 59 years old.

3. **Determine Keisha's current age**: 
   - Olivia is currently 15 years older than Keisha. 
   - Therefore, Keisha's current age is 35 - 15 = 20 years old.

4. **Calculate the average age of Olivia, Bodhi, and Keisha**: 
   - The sum of their ages is 35 (Olivia) + 59 (Bodhi) + 20 (Keisha) = 114 years.
   - There are 3 people, so the average age is 114 / 3 = 38 years.

5. **Determine how much younger Keisha is than the average age**: 
   - The average age is 38 years, and Keisha is currently 20 years old.
   - The difference is 38 - 20 = 18 years.

The answer is 18.",18.0,1,,18.0,1
