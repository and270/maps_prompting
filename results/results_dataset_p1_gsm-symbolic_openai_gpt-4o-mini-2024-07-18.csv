How much was the total cost if she received 25% discount on all purchases?",582.0,"To find the total cost of Beatriz's purchases, we will calculate the cost of each type of baked good, sum them up, and then apply the 25% discount.

1. **Calculate the cost of croissants:**
   - Beatriz bought 6 dozen croissants at $19 per dozen.
   \[
   \text{Cost of croissants} = 6 \text{ dozen} \times 19 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 114 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of macarons:**
   - Beatriz bought 4 dozen macarons at $77 per dozen.
   \[
   \text{Cost of macarons} = 4 \text{ dozen} \times 77 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 308 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of brownies:**
   - Beatriz bought 3 dozen brownies at $118 per dozen.
   \[
   \text{Cost of brownies} = 3 \text{ dozen} \times 118 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 354 \text{ dollars}

[Example Input]
Question: I have 20 liters of a fruit punch that is one-fifth water, and I want to mix it with 10 liters of a soda that is three-quarters water. If I accidentally spill 5 liters of the fruit punch, how much water is in the final mixture in liters, and what percentage of the final mixture is water?
Wrong answer: I calculated the total water in the fruit punch and soda, but I forgot to account for the spilled fruit punch. I ended up saying there were 15 liters of water in the final mixture, which is incorrect.
---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total amount of water because I did not subtract the water from the spilled fruit punch before calculating the final mixture.
Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Oversight
- Incorrect subtraction
Instructions:
1. Calculate the amount of water in the original fruit punch (20 liters * 1/5).
2. Calculate the amount of water in the soda (10 liters * 3/4).
3. Determine the volume of the spilled fruit punch and subtract its water content from the total.
4. Add the remaining water from the fruit punch and the soda.
5. Calculate the total volume of the final mixture (original fruit punch - spilled amount + soda).
6. Find the percentage of water in the final mixture by dividing the total water by the total volume and multiplying by 100.
Advice:
- Always double-check the calculations for any spills or losses in volume.
- Keep track of the individual contributions of each component in a mixture.
- When dealing with percentages, ensure to convert them to actual volumes before combining.
Solution:
The correct reasoning shows that the amount of water in the fruit punch is 4 liters (20 * 1/5), and in the soda, it is 7.5 liters (10 * 3/4). After spilling 5 liters of fruit punch (which contains 1 liter of water), the total water is 4 + 7.5 - 1 = 10.5 liters. The final volume is 20 - 5 + 10 = 25 liters. The percentage of water in the final mixture is (10.5 / 25) * 100 = 42%.

p1,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Mei can run four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is 1/2 as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 10 hours if she spends 2/5 of the time running, 1/2 of the time skipping, and the remaining of the time walking?",27.0,"To solve the problem, we first need to determine Mei's walking, running, and skipping speeds based on the information provided.

1. **Determine Mei's skipping speed**:
   - We know that Mei can skip at a speed of 2 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Mei's running speed**:
   - It is given that she can skip at a rate that is 1/2 as fast as she can run. Therefore, if her skipping speed is 2 miles per hour, her running speed can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

3. **Determine Mei's walking speed**:
   - It is stated that Mei can run four times faster than she can walk. Thus, we can find her walking speed:
   \[
   \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

Now we have the following speeds:
- Walking speed: 1 mile per hour
- Running speed: 4 miles per hour
- Skipping speed: 2 miles per hour

4. **Determine the time spent on each activity**:
   - The total time is 10 hours.
   - Time spent running: 
   \[
   \text{Time running} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10 = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]
   - Time spent skipping:
   \[
   \text{Time skipping} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]
   - Time spent walking:
   \[
   \text{Time walking} = 10 - \left(4 + 5\right) = 10 - 9 = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

5. **Calculate the distance traveled in each activity**:
   - Distance running:
   \[
   \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 4 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
   \]
   - Distance skipping:
   \[
   \text{Distance skipping} = \text{Skipping speed} \times \text{Time skipping} = 2 \text{ miles per hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ miles}
   \]
   - Distance walking:
   \[
   \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 1 \text{ mile}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled**:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance skipping} + \text{Distance walking} = 16 + 10 + 1 = 27 \text{ miles}
   \]

Thus, the total distance Mei can travel in 10 hours is \(\boxed{27}\) miles.",27.0,1,"A: Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine Mei's running speed**: 
   - We know that she can skip at 2 miles per hour, and skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is 2 miles per hour * 2 = 4 miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the total time spent running, skipping, and walking**:
   - The total time is 10 hours.
   - She spends 2/5 of the time running: 
     \[
     \text{Time running} = 10 \times \frac{2}{5} = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - She spends 1/2 of the time skipping:
     \[
     \text{Time skipping} = 10 \times \frac{1}{2} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - The remaining time is for walking:
     \[
     \text{Remaining time} = 10 - (4 + 5) = 1 \text{ hour}
     \]

3. **Determine Mei's walking speed**:
   - Since she runs four times faster than she walks, we can find her walking speed:
   - Let \( w \) be her walking speed. Then, her running speed is \( 4w \).
   - We already found her running speed to be 4 miles per hour, so:
     \[
     4w = 4 \implies w = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
     \]

4. **Calculate the distance traveled in each activity**:
   - **Distance running**:
     \[
     \text{Distance running} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 4 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - **Distance skipping**:
     \[
     \text{Distance skipping} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 2 \text{ miles per hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - **Distance walking**:
     \[
     \text{Distance walking} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 1 \text{ mile}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total distance traveled**:
   - Total distance = Distance running + Distance skipping + Distance walking:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = 16 + 10 + 1 = 27 \text{ miles}

If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?",180.0,"To determine how many ounces of cookies you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume**:
   - Your daily calorie target is 2300 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1200 calories.
   - You have burned 100 calories through exercise.

   The effective calories consumed after exercise is:
   \[
   \text{Effective calories consumed} = 1200 - 100 = 1100 \text{ calories}
   \]

   Now, calculate the remaining calories:
   \[
   \text{Remaining calories} = 2300 - 1100 = 1200 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine how many servings of cookies you can eat**:
   - Each serving of cookies has 200 calories.
   - To find out how many servings you can consume with the remaining calories:
   \[
   \text{Number of servings} = \frac{\text{Remaining calories}}{\text{Calories per serving}} = \frac{1200}{200} = 6 \text{ servings}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total ounces of cookies you can eat**:
   - The bag contains 5 servings and has a total weight of 150 oz.
   - First, find the weight of one serving:
   \[
   \text{Weight per serving} = \frac{150 \text{ oz}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 30 \text{ oz per serving}
   \]

   Now, calculate the total ounces for 6 servings:
   \[
   \text{Total ounces} = 6 \text{ servings} \times 30 \text{ oz per serving} = 180 \text{ oz}
   \]

However, since the bag only contains 150 oz, you cannot eat 6 servings. You can only eat the total amount available in the bag.

4. **Conclusion**:
   You can eat the entire 150 oz bag of cookies, which corresponds to 5 servings, since you cannot exceed the amount available in the bag. 

Thus, the answer is that you can eat **150 oz of cookies**.",150.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many calories are left in the daily calorie target after consuming some calories and exercising.
   - Daily calorie target: 2300 calories
   - Calories already consumed: 1200 calories
   - Calories burned through exercise: 100 calories

   So, the remaining calories are:
   \[
   2300 - 1200 + 100 = 1200 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many calories are in one serving of cookies.
   - Each serving has 200 calories.

3. Now, we can calculate how many servings can be consumed with the remaining calories.
   - Remaining calories: 1200 calories
   - Calories per serving: 200 calories

   The number of servings that can be consumed is:
   \[
   \frac{1200}{200} = 6 \text{ servings}

   - He watched 4 hours each night for 2 nights.
   - Total time for Saturday and Sunday:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}

If she used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.",504.0,"To solve the problem, we need to break down the information given and set up equations based on the ratios provided.

1. **Understanding the Ratios**:
   - The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 63:14.
   - The ratio of tablespoons of milk to cups of water is 9:7.

2. **Let’s define variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the common multiplier for the ratio of sugar to water.
   - Let \( y \) be the common multiplier for the ratio of milk to water.

3. **Expressing the quantities**:
   - The amount of sugar (in teaspoons) can be expressed as \( 63x \).
   - The amount of water (in cups) can be expressed as \( 14x \).
   - The amount of milk (in tablespoons) can be expressed as \( 9y \).

4. **Total quantity**:
   - According to the problem, the total amount of sugar, water, and milk is 760. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   63x + 14x + 9y = 760
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   77x + 9y = 760
   \]

5. **Relating \( y \) to \( x \)**:
   - Since the amount of water is the same in both ratios, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \). From the ratio of milk to water (9:7), we have:
   \[
   7 \text{ cups of water} = 9 \text{ tablespoons of milk}
   \]
   Therefore, the amount of water in terms of \( y \) is:
   \[
   14x = 7k \quad \text{(for some integer } k\text{)}
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   k = 2x
   \]
   Substituting \( k \) into the milk equation gives:
   \[
   y = \frac{9k}{7} = \frac{9(2x)}{7} = \frac{18x}{7}
   \]

6. **Substituting \( y \) back into the total equation**:
   \[
   77x + 9\left(\frac{18x}{7}\right) = 760
   \]
   Simplifying this:
   \[
   77x + \frac{162x}{7} = 760
   \]
   To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 7:
   \[
   539x + 162x = 5320
   \]
   Combining like terms:
   \[
   701x = 5320
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{5320}{701} \approx 7.588
   \]

7. **Finding the amount of sugar**:
   Now we can find the amount of sugar:
   \[
   \text{Teaspoons of sugar} = 63x \approx 63 \times 7.588 \approx 477.036
   \]
   Since the number of teaspoons must be a whole number, we round it to the nearest whole number:
   \[
   \text{Teaspoons of sugar} \approx 477
   \]

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Fatima used is approximately **477 teaspoons**.",477.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Understanding the ratios**: 
   - The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 63:14.
   - The ratio of tablespoons of milk to cups of water is 9:7.

2. **Finding the total parts in the sugar and water ratio**:
   - The total parts in the sugar and water ratio is 63 + 14 = 77 parts.

3. **Finding the total parts in the milk and water ratio**:
   - The total parts in the milk and water ratio is 9 + 7 = 16 parts.

4. **Finding the total parts**:
   - The total parts for sugar, water, and milk combined is 77 (from sugar and water) + 16 (from milk and water) = 93 parts.

5. **Finding the value of each part**:
   - We know that the total amount used (teaspoons of sugar + cups of water + tablespoons of milk) is 760.
   - Therefore, each part is 760 / 93 ≈ 8.15 (approximately).

6. **Calculating the amount of sugar**:
   - The amount of sugar corresponds to 63 parts.
   - So, the total teaspoons of sugar used is 63 * 8.15 ≈ 513.45.

Since we are looking for the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar, we can round this to the nearest whole number.

The answer is approximately 513 teaspoons of sugar.",513.0,0,1,0,556.7,"--- Beginning of the template ---

[Example Input]
Question: A recipe requires flour, sugar, and butter in the ratio of 4:2:1. If a baker uses a total of 140 grams of these ingredients, how many grams of sugar did the baker use?
Wrong answer: I calculated the total parts of the ratio as 4 + 2 + 1 = 7, and then I divided 140 by 4 to find the amount of flour, which is 35 grams. I mistakenly thought that the amount of sugar would be the same as flour, so I said the baker used 35 grams of sugar.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the amount of sugar by incorrectly assuming it was the same as the amount of flour. I should have calculated the sugar based on its ratio part, which is 2 out of the total 7 parts.

Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding ratios
- Incorrect assumption
- Calculation error

Instructions:
1. Identify the ratio parts for each ingredient.
2. Calculate the total number of parts in the ratio.
3. Divide the total amount of ingredients by the total number of parts to find the value of one part.
4. Multiply the value of one part by the number of parts for sugar to find the correct amount of sugar.

Advice:
- Always double-check the ratio parts before making calculations.
- Remember that each component in a ratio has a different value based on its part.
- Practice similar problems to become more familiar with ratio calculations.

Solution:
The total parts of the ratio are 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. The value of one part is 140 grams / 7 parts = 20 grams. Therefore, the amount of sugar is 20 grams * 2 parts = 40 grams.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Fatima makes coffee using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 63:14. She also uses 9 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water. If she used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 513.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the amount of sugar by not properly considering the total ratio of all ingredients involved. I mistakenly focused only on the sugar and water ratio without accounting for the milk, which also contributes to the total of 760 teaspoons. This led to an incorrect assumption about the distribution of the total amount.

### Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding total contributions
- Incorrect ratio application
- Calculation error

### Solution:
1. **Identify the ratios**: The ratio of sugar to water is 63:14, and for milk to water, it is 9:7.
2. **Calculate the total parts for sugar and water**: 
   - Total parts for sugar and water = 63 + 14 = 77 parts.
3. **Calculate the total parts for milk and water**: 
   - Total parts for milk and water = 9 + 7 = 16 parts.
4. **Combine the ratios**: To find a common ratio, we need to express the water in both ratios. The water part is common, so we can express the total parts as:
   - For sugar and water: 63 (sugar) + 14 (water) = 77 parts.
   - For milk and water: 9 (milk) + 7 (water) = 16 parts.
   - The total parts = 77 + 16 - 7 (since water is counted in both) = 86 parts.
5. **Calculate the value of one part**: 
   - Total amount = 760 teaspoons.
   - Value of one part = 760 teaspoons / 86 parts = approximately 8.837 teaspoons per part.
6. **Calculate the amount of sugar**: 
   - Sugar part = 63 parts.
   - Total sugar = 63 parts * 8.837 teaspoons/part = approximately 556.7 teaspoons.

### Instructions:
1. Identify all the ingredients and their respective ratios.
2. Calculate the total parts for each ratio, ensuring to account for any common ingredients.
3. Combine the total parts from all ratios, subtracting any overlapping parts.
4. Divide the total amount by the total number of parts to find the value of one part.
5. Multiply the value of one part by the number of parts for each ingredient to find the correct amounts.

### Advice:
- Always ensure to account for all ingredients in the problem, especially when they share common components.
- Double-check the ratios and their contributions to the total before performing calculations.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I initially miscalculated the total contributions of each ingredient based on the ratios provided. I failed to properly account for the total amount of ingredients and how they relate to the ratios. Additionally, I did not correctly convert the measurements between teaspoons, cups, and tablespoons, which led to an incorrect total.

### Error Keywords:
- Misapplication of ratio
- Incorrect total calculation
- Unit conversion error
- Oversight in checking work

### Solution:
1. **Identify the ratios and total amount**: 
   - The ratio of sugar to water is 63:14.
   - The ratio of milk to water is 9:7.
   - The total amount of ingredients used is 760 teaspoons.

2. **Calculate the total parts in the sugar and water ratio**:
   - Total parts for sugar and water = 63 + 14 = 77 parts.

3. **Calculate the total parts in the milk and water ratio**:
   - Total parts for milk and water = 9 + 7 = 16 parts.

4. **Determine the total parts for all ingredients**:
   - Since water is common in both ratios, we need to express everything in terms of water. 
   - Let’s denote the amount of water used as \( x \) cups. 
   - From the sugar and water ratio, the total amount of sugar used is \( \frac{63}{77} \times (63 + 14)x \).
   - From the milk and water ratio, the total amount of milk used is \( \frac{9}{16} \times (9 + 7)x \).

5. **Set up the equation**:
   - Total amount = sugar + water + milk
   - \( 760 = \frac{63}{77}(77x) + x + \frac{9}{16}(16x) \)
   - Simplifying gives:
   - \( 760 = 63x + x + 9x \)
   - \( 760 = 73x \)

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - \( x = \frac{760}{73} \approx 10.41 \) cups of water.

7. **Calculate the amount of sugar**:
   - Sugar = \( \frac{63}{77} \times (77 \times 10.41) \)
   - Sugar = \( 63 \times 10.41 \approx 656.83 \) teaspoons.

### Final Answer:
Fatima used approximately **657 teaspoons of sugar**.

I answered the question incorrectly because I miscalculated the total parts of the ratio and did not properly account for the contributions of each ingredient to the total of 760 teaspoons. I failed to correctly apply the ratios of sugar and water to find the correct amount of sugar used.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Ratio application
- Incorrect total parts
- Misinterpretation of ingredients

### Solution:
1. **Identify the ratios**: The ratio of sugar to water is 63:14. For every 63 teaspoons of sugar, there are 14 cups of water.
2. **Calculate total parts in the ratio**: 
   - Total parts = 63 (sugar) + 14 (water) = 77 parts.
3. **Determine the total parts for milk**: 
   - The ratio of milk to water is 9:7. For every 7 cups of water, there are 9 tablespoons of milk.
   - Since we have 14 cups of water (from the sugar-water ratio), we can find the amount of milk:
     - Milk = (14 cups of water / 7 cups) * 9 tablespoons = 18 tablespoons of milk.
4. **Convert tablespoons of milk to teaspoons**: 
   - 1 tablespoon = 3 teaspoons, so 18 tablespoons = 18 * 3 = 54 teaspoons of milk.
5. **Calculate total ingredients**: 
   - Total ingredients = sugar + water + milk = 760 teaspoons.
   - Let the amount of sugar be \( S \) and the amount of water be \( W \).
   - We know \( S + W + 54 = 760 \) → \( S + W = 706 \).
6. **Set up the ratio equation**: 
   - From the ratio, we can express \( W \) in terms of \( S \):
     - \( W = \frac{14}{63}S \) (since \( W/S = 14/63 \)).
7. **Substitute into the total equation**:
   - \( S + \frac{14}{63}S = 706 \).
   - Combine terms: \( S(1 + \frac{14}{63}) = 706 \).
   - Simplify: \( S(\frac{63 + 14}{63}) = 706 \) → \( S(\frac{77}{63}) = 706 \).
   - Solve for \( S \): 
     - \( S = 706 * \frac{63}{77} \).
     - \( S = 706 * 0.8182 \approx 577.0 \) teaspoons of sugar.

### Instructions:
1. Identify the ratios of the ingredients involved.
2. Calculate the total number of parts in the ratios.
3. Convert any additional ingredients into the same measurement units if necessary.
4. Set up an equation based on the total amount of ingredients used.
5. Substitute the ratio relationships into the total equation.

How many oranges can Jin harvest in 2 years?,9680.0,"To find out how many oranges Jin can harvest in 2 years, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total area of the orange field**: Jin has 55 square meters of orange field.

2. **Determine the number of oranges per square meter**: Since there are 44 oranges per one-half square meter, we can find the number of oranges per square meter by doubling that amount:
   \[
   \text{Oranges per square meter} = 44 \text{ oranges} \times 2 = 88 \text{ oranges}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of oranges in the field**: Now, we can find the total number of oranges in the entire field by multiplying the number of oranges per square meter by the total area:
   \[
   \text{Total oranges} = 88 \text{ oranges/square meter} \times 55 \text{ square meters} = 4840 \text{ oranges}

Jin has 55 square meters of orange field.  
There are 44 oranges per one-half a square meter.  

First, we need to find out how many oranges are in one square meter.  
Since there are 2 halves in one square meter, we multiply the number of oranges in one-half a square meter by 2:  
44 oranges * 2 = 88 oranges per square meter.  

Next, we calculate the total number of oranges in Jin's 55 square meters:  
88 oranges/square meter * 55 square meters = 4840 oranges.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row?,43.75,"To solve the problem, we need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 on a 20-sided die, and the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 10:**
   A 20-sided die has the numbers 1 through 20. The numbers greater than 10 are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. 

   There are 10 numbers greater than 10. Therefore, the probability \( P(\text{greater than 10}) \) is:
   \[
   P(\text{greater than 10}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5

2. **Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row:**
   The odd numbers on a 20-sided die are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19. There are 10 odd numbers.

   The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is:
   \[
   P(\text{odd}) = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5

   Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row is:
   \[
   P(\text{four odd numbers}) = P(\text{odd})^4 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16} = 0.0625

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   Now we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 10 compared to rolling four odd numbers in a row. We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Difference in probabilities} = P(\text{greater than 10}) - P(\text{four odd numbers}) = 0.5 - 0.0625 = 0.4375

p1,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Yuki was a pen pal with 8 people. He stopped being penpals with 4 of them. They each send 3 letters a week that are 10 pages long. He responds in kind. He can write a page every 14 minutes. On average, how many hours does Yuki spend writing in a day?",4.0,"To find out how many hours Yuki spends writing in a day, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Yuki is still in contact with:**
   - Yuki originally had 8 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 4 of them.
   - Therefore, the number of pen pals he still has is:
     \[
     8 - 4 = 4
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of letters sent per week:**
   - Each of the 4 pen pals sends 3 letters a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of letters sent per week is:
     \[
     4 \text{ pen pals} \times 3 \text{ letters/pen pal} = 12 \text{ letters/week}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pages Yuki receives per week:**
   - Each letter is 10 pages long.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages Yuki receives per week is:
     \[
     12 \text{ letters/week} \times 10 \text{ pages/letter} = 120 \text{ pages/week}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pages Yuki writes per week:**
   - Yuki responds in kind, so he also writes 120 pages per week.

5. **Determine how long it takes Yuki to write those pages:**
   - Yuki can write 1 page every 14 minutes.
   - Therefore, the time taken to write 120 pages is:
     \[
     120 \text{ pages} \times 14 \text{ minutes/page} = 1680 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

6. **Convert the total writing time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
     \[
     \frac{1680 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 28 \text{ hours/week}
     \]

7. **Calculate the average time spent writing per day:**
   - There are 7 days in a week, so the average time spent writing per day is:
     \[
     \frac{28 \text{ hours/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ hours/day}
     \]

Thus, Yuki spends an average of **4 hours** writing in a day.",4.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Yuki was a pen pal with 8 people.
2. He stopped being pen pals with 4 of them.
3. So, the number of pen pals he has now is 8 - 4 = 4.
4. Each of these 4 pen pals sends 3 letters a week.
5. Therefore, the total number of letters Yuki receives in a week is 4 * 3 = 12 letters.
6. Each letter is 10 pages long.
7. So, the total number of pages Yuki receives in a week is 12 * 10 = 120 pages.
8. Yuki responds to each page he receives, so he also writes 120 pages in a week.
9. Yuki can write a page every 14 minutes.
10. The total time Yuki spends writing 120 pages is 120 * 14 minutes = 1680 minutes.
11. To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 1680 / 60 = 28 hours.
12. Since this is the total time spent in a week, we need to find the average time spent per day. There are 7 days in a week.
13. So, the average time spent writing in a day is 28 hours / 7 days = 4 hours.

The answer is 4 hours.",4.0,1,0,1,4.0,,,

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 4% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 13% of the selling price. If Ms. Johnson can get 10% discount on the selling price, how much more is the total cost will be than Ms. Johnson's budget?",56500.0,"To determine how much more the total cost will be than Ms. Johnson's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the property after applying the discount and adding the brokerage and transfer fees.

1. **Calculate the discount on the selling price:**
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = 500,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 10\% \text{ of Selling Price} = 0.10 \times 500,000 = 50,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Discount} = 500,000 - 50,000 = 450,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 4\% \text{ of Selling Price} = 0.04 \times 500,000 = 20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 13\% \text{ of Selling Price} = 0.13 \times 500,000 = 65,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Discounted Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}

   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Budget} = 535,000 - 470,000 = 65,000
   \]

Thus, the total cost will be **$65,000** more than Ms. Johnson's budget.",65000.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Selling Price**: The property has a selling price of $500,000.

2. **Discount**: Ms. Johnson can get a 10% discount on the selling price.
   - The discount amount is 10% of $500,000:
     \[
     \text{Discount} = 0.10 \times 500,000 = 50,000
     \]
   - The selling price after the discount is:
     \[
     \text{Discounted Price} = 500,000 - 50,000 = 450,000
     \]

3. **Brokerage Fee**: The brokerage fee is 4% of the selling price.
   - The brokerage fee is:
     \[
     \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.04 \times 500,000 = 20,000
     \]

4. **Transfer Fee**: The transfer fee is 13% of the selling price.
   - The transfer fee is:
     \[
     \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.13 \times 500,000 = 65,000
     \]

5. **Total Cost**: Now, we calculate the total cost including the discounted price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee:
   - Total cost is:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = \text{Discounted Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 450,000 + 20,000 + 65,000 = 535,000
     \]

6. **Budget Comparison**: Ms. Johnson's budget is $470,000. We need to find out how much more the total cost is than her budget:
   - The difference is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Budget}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 535,000 - 470,000 = 65,000

[Example Input]
Question: Sarah wants to buy a car that costs $25,000. She has a budget of $22,000. Additionally, there is a sales tax of 8% on the car price and a documentation fee of $500. If she can negotiate a discount of 5% on the car price, how much more will the total cost be than Sarah's budget?

Wrong answer: I calculated the total cost as $25,000 - 5% = $23,750. Then I added the sales tax of 8% ($1,900) and the documentation fee of $500, giving a total of $26,150. I concluded that the cost exceeds her budget by $4,150. I miscalculated the discount and did not apply it correctly before adding the fees.

Explanation:
I miscalculated the discount on the car price and did not apply it correctly before calculating the total cost, which led to an incorrect total.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Discount application
- Incorrect total cost calculation

Instructions:
1. Identify the original price of the item.
2. Calculate the discount amount and subtract it from the original price to find the discounted price.
3. Calculate the sales tax based on the discounted price.
4. Add any additional fees to the discounted price and sales tax to find the total cost.
5. Compare the total cost to the budget to determine how much it exceeds the budget.

Advice:
- Always double-check the calculations for discounts and fees.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid confusion.
- Keep track of the budget and ensure all costs are accounted for before concluding.

Solution:
1. Original price: $25,000
2. Discount: 5% of $25,000 = $1,250; Discounted price = $25,000 - $1,250 = $23,750
3. Sales tax: 8% of $23,750 = $1,900
4. Documentation fee: $500
5. Total cost = $23,750 + $1,900 + $500 = $26,150
6. Budget = $22,000; Total cost exceeds budget by $26,150 - $22,000 = $4,150

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I failed to properly account for the discount before calculating the additional fees (brokerage and transfer fees). I mistakenly calculated the fees based on the original selling price instead of the discounted price, leading to an inflated total cost.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect application of fees
- Discount application error

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the discount on the selling price:**
   - Selling price = $500,000
   - Discount = 10% of $500,000 = $50,000

2. **Calculate the discounted price:**
   - Discounted price = $500,000 - $50,000 = $450,000

3. **Calculate the brokerage fee (4% of the selling price):**
   - Brokerage fee = 4% of $500,000 = $20,000

4. **Calculate the transfer fee (13% of the selling price):**
   - Transfer fee = 13% of $500,000 = $65,000

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Discounted price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
   - Total cost = $450,000 + $20,000 + $65,000 = $535,000

6. **Compare the total cost to Ms. Johnson's budget:**
   - Budget = $470,000
   - Difference = Total cost - Budget = $535,000 - $470,000 = $65,000

The total cost exceeds Ms. Johnson's budget by **$65,000**.

### Instructions:
1. Identify the original selling price and the budget.
2. Calculate the discount based on the original selling price.
3. Subtract the discount from the original selling price to find the discounted price.
4. Calculate any additional fees (brokerage, transfer, etc.) based on the original selling price.
5. Add the discounted price and the additional fees to find the total cost.
6. Compare the total cost to the budget to determine how much more it exceeds the budget.

### General Advice:
- Always apply discounts before calculating any additional fees.
- Ensure that all calculations are based on the correct figures (discounted vs. original).
- Break down the problem into clear steps to avoid confusion and ensure accuracy.
- Double-check each step to confirm that the calculations align with the problem requirements.","--- Beginning of the template ---

2. **Calculate the agent fee**:
   \[
   \text{Agent Fee} = 6\% \text{ of } 540000 = 0.06 \times 540000 = 32400

3. **Calculate the total costs**:
   - Remaining loan amount: $260,000
   - Closing costs: $5,000
   - Total costs = Registration Fees + Agent Fee + Remaining Loan + Closing Costs
   \[
   \text{Total Costs} = 16200 + 32400 + 260000 + 5000 = 303600

Thus, Prof. Johnson's net proceeds from selling the apartment are **$236,400**.",236400.0,0,"A: Let's think step by step.

1. Prof. Johnson sold his apartment for $540,000.
2. He paid registration fees of 3% of the selling price:

   \[
   \text{Price after Year 3} = ¥93 + ¥23.25 = ¥116.25

   \]

6. **Calculate the profit**:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Value} - \text{Initial Investment} = ¥1,395 - ¥960 = ¥435
   \]

Thus, Ananya's profit by the end of the third year is **¥435**.",435.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Ananya buys 12 shares of a stock for ¥80 each.
   - The total cost of the shares is 12 * 80 = ¥960.

2. The stock price increases by 55% in the first year.
   - The increase in price is 80 * 0.55 = ¥44.
   - So, the new price after the first year is 80 + 44 = ¥124.

3. In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%.
   - The decrease in price is 124 * 0.25 = ¥31.
   - So, the new price after the second year is 124 - 31 = ¥93.

4. In the third year, the stock price increases by 25%.
   - The increase in price is 93 * 0.25 = ¥23.25.
   - So, the new price after the third year is 93 + 23.25 = ¥116.25.

5. Now, let's calculate the total value of Ananya's shares at the end of the third year.
   - The total value is 12 shares * ¥116.25 = ¥1,395.

6. Finally, we calculate the profit Ananya made.
   - The profit is the total value of the shares minus the total cost.
   - Profit = ¥1,395 - ¥960 = ¥435.

She wants to make sure she and her friends each get to play one round of laser tag, have €4 in pinball tokens, and get to ride the roller coaster three times. A round of laser tag is €6. The roller coaster costs €10 per ride. For the transportation of the birthday party guests, Emma needs to rent a bus for the day, which costs €60. How many friends can she invite?",2.0,"To determine how many friends Emma can invite to her birthday party, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and then see how many friends can be accommodated within her budget of €180.

1. **Calculate the cost of one round of laser tag for Emma and her friends:**
   - Cost of one round of laser tag: €6
   - Let \( n \) be the number of friends Emma invites. Therefore, the total number of participants (Emma + friends) is \( n + 1 \).
   - Total cost for laser tag: \( 6(n + 1) \)

2. **Calculate the cost of pinball tokens for Emma and her friends:**
   - Cost of pinball tokens per person: €4
   - Total cost for pinball tokens: \( 4(n + 1) \)

3. **Calculate the cost of roller coaster rides for Emma and her friends:**
   - Cost of one roller coaster ride: €10
   - Total rides for each person: 3
   - Total cost for roller coaster rides: \( 10 \times 3(n + 1) = 30(n + 1) \)

4. **Calculate the cost of renting the bus:**
   - Cost of bus rental: €60

5. **Set up the total cost equation:**
   The total cost for the party can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Laser Tag} + \text{Cost of Pinball Tokens} + \text{Cost of Roller Coaster} + \text{Cost of Bus}
   \]
   Substituting the costs we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 6(n + 1) + 4(n + 1) + 30(n + 1) + 60
   \]

6. **Combine like terms:**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = (6 + 4 + 30)(n + 1) + 60 = 40(n + 1) + 60
   \]

7. **Set the total cost less than or equal to the budget:**
   \[
   40(n + 1) + 60 \leq 180
   \]

8. **Solve the inequality:**
   \[
   40(n + 1) \leq 180 - 60
   \]
   \[
   40(n + 1) \leq 120
   \]
   \[
   n + 1 \leq \frac{120}{40}

   \[
   n + 1 \leq 3
   \]
   \[
   n \leq 3 - 1

This means Emma can invite a maximum of 2 friends.

9. **Conclusion:**
   Emma can invite **2 friends** to her birthday party.",2.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Total Budget**: Emma has €180 budgeted for her birthday party.

2. **Costs for Activities**:
   - **Laser Tag**: Each round costs €6. If Emma and her friends each play one round, we need to calculate the total cost for laser tag.
   - **Pinball Tokens**: Each person needs €4 in pinball tokens.
   - **Roller Coaster**: Each ride costs €10, and Emma wants to ride it 3 times. So, the cost for the roller coaster per person is 3 * €10 = €30.

3. **Total Cost per Person**:
   - Cost for laser tag: €6
   - Cost for pinball tokens: €4
   - Cost for roller coaster: €30
   - Total cost per person = €6 + €4 + €30 = €40.

4. **Bus Rental Cost**: The bus rental costs €60.

5. **Total Cost for Friends**: Let \( n \) be the number of friends Emma invites. The total cost for Emma and her friends will be:
   - Total cost = Cost for Emma + Cost for friends + Bus rental
   - Total cost = €40 * (n + 1) + €60, where \( n + 1 \) accounts for Emma and her friends.

6. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - We know the total budget is €180, so we set up the equation:
   \[
   40(n + 1) + 60 = 180
   \]

7. **Solving the Equation**:
   - First, simplify the equation:
   \[
   40n + 40 + 60 = 180
   \]
   \[
   40n + 100 = 180
   \]
   - Now, subtract 100 from both sides:
   \[
   40n = 80
   \]
   - Finally, divide by 40:
   \[
   n = 2

     25 + 63 = 88 \text{ kiwis}
     \]

3. **Pineapples After First Purchase**:
   - Theo buys 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis:
     \[
     88 - 19 = 69 \text{ pineapples}
     \]

4. **After Buying More Pineapples**:
   - Theo then buys 13 more pineapples:
     \[
     69 + 13 = 82 \text{ pineapples}
     \]

5. **Calculating the Final Number of Pineapples**:
   - Theo buys 22 fewer than two times the number of kiwis:
     \[
     2 \times 88 = 176
     \]
     \[
     176 - 22 = 154 \text{ pineapples}
     \]
   - Adding this to the previous total:
     \[
     82 + 154 = 236 \text{ pineapples}
     \]

6. **Final Totals**:
   - Total kiwis: 88
   - Total pineapples: 236
   - Combined total:
     \[
     88 + 236 = 324
     \]

### Final Answer:
Theo has a total of **324 fruits** (kiwis and pineapples combined).

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I miscalculated the number of pineapples after Theo's purchases and failed to accurately track the changes in quantities throughout the problem. I also did not properly account for the relationships between the quantities of kiwis and pineapples, leading to an incorrect total.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect tracking
- Relationship misunderstanding
- Addition error

### Solution:
1. **Initial Quantities**:
   - Theo has 25 kiwis.
   - Since there are eight times as many pineapples as kiwis, the number of pineapples is \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \).

2. **After Buying More Kiwis**:
   - Theo buys 63 more kiwis: 
     \[
     25 + 63 = 88 \text{ kiwis}
     \]

3. **Adjusting Pineapples**:
   - Theo buys 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis:
     \[
     88 - 19 = 69 \text{ pineapples}
     \]

4. **After Further Purchases**:
   - Theo then buys 13 more pineapples:
     \[
     69 + 13 = 82 \text{ pineapples}
     \]
   - He also buys 22 fewer than two times the number of kiwis:
     \[
     2 \times 88 = 176
     \]
     \[
     176 - 22 = 154 \text{ pineapples}
     \]

5. **Final Count of Pineapples**:
   - The total number of pineapples after all purchases is:
     \[
     82 + 154 = 236 \text{ pineapples}
     \]

6. **Total Fruits**:
   - Finally, the total number of fruits (kiwis + pineapples) is:
     \[
     88 + 236 = 324 \text{ fruits}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Theo has a total of **324 fruits** in his house combined.

p1,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Ananya went to the boardwalk for vacation. Her parents gave her $1200 to buy whatever she wanted. At the gift shop, saltwater taffy was on sale for ""Buy 16 kgs at $23 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/2 off."" She scooped up 23 kgs. She also bought a mixed bag of starfish for $11.0 and 17 keychains that were $20.0 each. Ananya then donated $5 at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Ananya have left?",361.0,"To find out how much money Ananya has left after her purchases, we will calculate the total cost of each item she bought and then subtract that from her initial amount of $1200.

1. **Cost of Saltwater Taffy:**
   - Ananya bought 23 kgs of saltwater taffy.
   - The offer is ""Buy 16 kgs at $23 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/2 off.""
   - First, calculate the cost for the first 16 kgs:
     \[
     16 \text{ kgs} \times 23 \text{ dollars/kg} = 368 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Now, for the next 4 kgs, since they are half off:
     \[
     4 \text{ kgs} \times \left(\frac{23}{2}\right) \text{ dollars/kg} = 4 \text{ kgs} \times 11.5 \text{ dollars/kg} = 46 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total cost for 20 kgs (16 kgs + 4 kgs):
     \[
     368 \text{ dollars} + 46 \text{ dollars} = 414 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Ananya still needs to buy 3 more kgs (23 kgs total - 20 kgs already calculated):
     \[
     3 \text{ kgs} \times 23 \text{ dollars/kg} = 69 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total cost for saltwater taffy:
     \[
     414 \text{ dollars} + 69 \text{ dollars} = 483 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of Mixed Bag of Starfish:**
   - The cost is $11.0.

3. **Cost of Keychains:**
   - Ananya bought 17 keychains at $20.0 each:
     \[
     17 \text{ keychains} \times 20 \text{ dollars/keychain} = 340 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - Now, we add up all the costs:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Taffy} + \text{Cost of Starfish} + \text{Cost of Keychains}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 483 \text{ dollars} + 11 \text{ dollars} + 340 \text{ dollars} = 834 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Donation:**
   - Ananya donated $5 at a charity stand.

6. **Final Calculation of Money Left:**
   - Subtract the total cost and the donation from the initial amount:
     \[
     \text{Money Left} = 1200 \text{ dollars} - 834 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Money Left} = 1200 - 834 - 5 = 361 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Ananya has **$361** left.",361.0,1,"A: Let's think step by step.

1. Ananya starts with $1200.
2. She buys 23 kgs of saltwater taffy. The price is structured as follows:
   - For the first 16 kgs, the cost is 16 kgs * $23/kg = $368.
   - For the next 4 kgs, she gets them at half price. The price for 4 kgs at half price is:
     - Regular price for 4 kgs = 4 kgs * $23/kg = $92.
     - Half price = $92 / 2 = $46.
   - For the remaining 3 kgs, the cost is 3 kgs * $23/kg = $69.
   - So, the total cost for the taffy is $368 + $46 + $69 = $483.

3. Next, Ananya buys a mixed bag of starfish for $11.0.
4. Then, she buys 17 keychains at $20.0 each. The total cost for the keychains is:
   - 17 keychains * $20.0/keychain = $340.

5. Now, let's calculate the total amount spent:
   - Total spent = Cost of taffy + Cost of starfish + Cost of keychains
   - Total spent = $483 + $11 + $340 = $834.

6. Ananya also donates $5 at a charity stand. So, we need to add this to her total spending:
   - Total spent including donation = $834 + $5 = $839.

7. Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount Ananya had:
   - Amount left = Initial amount - Total spent
   - Amount left = $1200 - $839 = $361.

The answer is $361.",361.0,1,0,1,361.0,,,

If the length of his room is 16 feet longer that its width, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?",68.0,"Let the width of Kai's office be \( w \) feet. According to the problem, the length \( l \) of the office is 16 feet longer than the width, so we can express the length as:

\[
l = w + 16
\]

The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[
A = l \times w
\]

We know the area is 225 square feet, so we can set up the equation:

\[
w \times (w + 16) = 225
\]

Expanding this equation gives:

\[
w^2 + 16w = 225
\]

To solve for \( w \), we rearrange the equation:

\[
w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0
\]

Now we can use the quadratic formula to solve for \( w \). The quadratic formula is:

\[
w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

In our equation, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 16 \), and \( c = -225 \). Plugging in these values:

\[
w = \frac{-16 \pm \sqrt{16^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-225)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]

Calculating the discriminant:

\[
16^2 = 256
\]
\[
-4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-225) = 900
\]
\[
b^2 - 4ac = 256 + 900 = 1156
\]

Now, taking the square root:

\[
\sqrt{1156} = 34
\]

Now substituting back into the quadratic formula:

\[
w = \frac{-16 \pm 34}{2}
\]

Calculating the two possible values for \( w \):

1. \( w = \frac{-16 + 34}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
2. \( w = \frac{-16 - 34}{2} = \frac{-50}{2} = -25 \) (not a valid solution since width cannot be negative)

Thus, the width \( w \) is 9 feet. Now we can find the length:

\[
l = w + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we can calculate the perimeter \( P \) of the rectangle using the formula:

\[
P = 2l + 2w
\]

Substituting the values of \( l \) and \( w \):

\[
P = 2(25) + 2(9) = 50 + 18 = 68 \text{ feet}

   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   225 = (w + 16) \times w

4. Expanding this equation gives:
   \[
   225 = w^2 + 16w
   \]
5. Rearranging the equation to set it to zero:
   \[
   w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0

6. Now, we can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
   \[
   w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 16 \), and \( c = -225 \).
7. Calculating the discriminant:
   \[
   b^2 - 4ac = 16^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-225) = 256 + 900 = 1156

8. Now, substituting back into the quadratic formula:
   \[
   w = \frac{-16 \pm \sqrt{1156}}{2 \times 1}

   \[
   w = \frac{-16 \pm 34}{2}
   \]
9. This gives us two possible solutions for \( w \):
   \[
   w = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \quad \text{(valid, since width cannot be negative)}
   \]
   \[
   w = \frac{-50}{2} = -25 \quad \text{(not valid)}

    \[
    \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) = 2 \times (25 + 9)

   - Therefore, the total number of cupcakes is:
     \[
     4 \text{ jars} \times 16 \text{ cupcakes/jar} = 64 \text{ cupcakes}
     \]

2. **Determine how many pans are needed to bake 64 cupcakes:**
   - Leilani has 9 pans, and each pan can hold 8 cupcakes.
   - The total capacity of all the pans is:
     \[
     9 \text{ pans} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes/pan} = 72 \text{ cupcakes}
     \]
   - Since 72 cupcakes can be baked and she only needs to bake 64 cupcakes, she will have enough pans.

3. **Calculate how many pans will be used for 64 cupcakes:**
   - To find out how many pans are needed for 64 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:
     \[
     \frac{64 \text{ cupcakes}}{8 \text{ cupcakes/pan}} = 8 \text{ pans}
     \]

4. **Determine how many empty pans will be left:**
   - Leilani has 9 pans and uses 8 pans, so the number of empty pans is:
     \[
     9 \text{ pans} - 8 \text{ pans used} = 1 \text{ empty pan}
     \]

Thus, after using all her sprinkles to bake cupcakes, Leilani will be left with **1 empty pan**.",1.0,1,"A: Let's think step by step.

1. Leilani has 4 jars of sprinkles.
2. Each jar can decorate 16 cupcakes.
3. So, the total number of cupcakes she can decorate is 4 * 16 = 64 cupcakes.

4. Leilani has 9 pans.
5. Each pan can hold 8 cupcakes.
6. So, the total number of cupcakes that can fit in all the pans is 9 * 8 = 72 cupcakes.

7. Now, we need to find out how many empty pans Leilani will have after baking 64 cupcakes.
8. Since she can fit 72 cupcakes in total and she is baking 64 cupcakes, we need to determine how many pans are used for the 64 cupcakes.
9. The number of pans needed for 64 cupcakes is 64 / 8 = 8 pans.

10. Finally, we find out how many empty pans are left.
11. Leilani has 9 pans and uses 8 pans, so the number of empty pans is 9 - 8 = 1.

1. **Calculate the total number of remoras that go away.**
   - There are 15 remoras in total.
   - \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the remoras go away:
     \[
     \text{Number of remoras that go away} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of remaining remoras.**
   - Remaining remoras:
     \[
     \text{Remaining remoras} = 15 - 3 = 12
     \]

3. **Calculate the total length of the remaining remoras.**
   - Each remora is 15 inches long.
   - Total length of the remaining remoras:
     \[
     \text{Total length of remaining remoras} = 12 \times 15 = 180 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Convert the shark's length from feet to inches.**
   - The shark is 75 feet long.
   - Since there are 12 inches in a foot:
     \[
     \text{Shark's length in inches} = 75 \times 12 = 900 \text{ inches}
     \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that is the combined length of the remaining remoras.**
   - The percentage is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total length of remaining remoras}}{\text{Shark's length}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{180}{900} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\%
     \]

Thus, the combined length of the remaining remoras is **20%** of the shark's body length.",20.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Ali saw a shark that is 75 feet long.
2. There are 15 remoras, each measuring 15 inches.
3. First, we need to find the total length of the remoras. Since there are 15 remoras, the total length is:
   \[
   15 \text{ remoras} \times 15 \text{ inches/remora} = 225 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. Next, we need to convert the shark's length from feet to inches because the remoras' length is in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
   \[
   75 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 900 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. Now, we need to determine how many remoras go away. Since \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the remoras leave, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \text{ remoras}
   \]

6. Therefore, the number of remaining remoras is:
   \[
   15 - 3 = 12 \text{ remoras}
   \]

7. Now, we calculate the total length of the remaining remoras:
   \[
   12 \text{ remoras} \times 15 \text{ inches/remora} = 180 \text{ inches}
   \]

8. Next, we need to find what percentage of the shark's body length (900 inches) is the combined length of the remaining remoras (180 inches). The percentage can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Here, the part is the length of the remaining remoras (180 inches) and the whole is the length of the shark (900 inches):
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{180}{900} \right) \times 100
   \]

9. Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   \frac{180}{900} = 0.2

Andre has six times as many tubes of black paint as the combined number of pink tubes that Sanjay and Yuki have, and 6 fewer tubes of white paint than the combined number of blue tubes that Sanjay and Yuki have. How many tubes of paint does Andre have?",96.0,"To find out how many tubes of paint Andre has, we will first determine how many tubes of pink and blue paint Yuki has based on the information given about Sanjay.

1. **Sanjay's Paint Tubes:**
   - Pink paint: 10 tubes
   - Blue paint: 3 tubes

2. **Yuki's Paint Tubes:**
   - Yuki has \( \frac{2}{4} \) (which simplifies to \( \frac{1}{2} \)) as many tubes of pink paint as Sanjay.
   - Therefore, Yuki's pink paint tubes = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) tubes.
   - Yuki has thrice as many tubes of blue paint as Sanjay.
   - Therefore, Yuki's blue paint tubes = \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) tubes.

3. **Combined Paint Tubes of Sanjay and Yuki:**
   - Total pink paint = Sanjay's pink + Yuki's pink = \( 10 + 5 = 15 \) tubes.
   - Total blue paint = Sanjay's blue + Yuki's blue = \( 3 + 9 = 12 \) tubes.

4. **Andre's Paint Tubes:**
   - Andre has six times as many tubes of black paint as the combined number of pink tubes that Sanjay and Yuki have.
   - Therefore, Andre's black paint tubes = \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) tubes.
   - Andre has 6 fewer tubes of white paint than the combined number of blue tubes that Sanjay and Yuki have.
   - Therefore, Andre's white paint tubes = \( 12 - 6 = 6 \) tubes.

   - Yuki has 2/4 (which simplifies to 1/2) as many tubes of pink paint as Sanjay.
   - So, Yuki has \( 10 \times \frac{1}{2} = 5 \) tubes of pink paint.

3. **Calculate how many tubes of blue paint Yuki has:**
   - Yuki has thrice as many tubes of blue paint as Sanjay.
   - So, Yuki has \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) tubes of blue paint.

4. **Calculate the total number of pink tubes for Sanjay and Yuki:**
   - Total pink tubes = Sanjay's pink tubes + Yuki's pink tubes
   - Total pink tubes = \( 10 + 5 = 15 \) tubes.

How many crackers won't he be able to place on the bowls or plates?",11.0,"To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the capacity of the plates**: 
   Each bowl can hold 21 crackers. Since each plate can hold two times that, we calculate the capacity of one plate:
   \[
   \text{Capacity of one plate} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ crackers}

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and plates**:
   Deshawn has 11 bowls and 4 plates. We calculate the total capacity:
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of bowls} = 11 \times 21 = 231 \text{ crackers}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of plates} = 4 \times 42 = 168 \text{ crackers}

She writes it in full five times, writes three-sixths of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. After some rest, again she re-writes everything she has written so far. How many letters has Kayla written in total?",572.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Writing the alphabet five times**:
   The English alphabet has 26 letters. If Kayla writes the alphabet in full five times, the total number of letters written is:
   \[
   5 \times 26 = 130
   \]

2. **Writing three-sixths of the alphabet once**:
   Three-sixths of the alphabet is equivalent to half of the alphabet. Therefore, the number of letters in three-sixths of the alphabet is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{6} \times 26 = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13
   \]

3. **Re-writing everything she has already written**:
   At this point, Kayla has written:
   - 130 letters from the five full alphabets
   - 13 letters from three-sixths of the alphabet

   The total letters written so far is:
   \[
   130 + 13 = 143
   \]
   Now, she re-writes everything she has already written, which adds another 143 letters:
   \[
   143
   \]

4. **Total after the first re-write**:
   After re-writing everything, the total number of letters is:
   \[
   143 + 143 = 286
   \]

5. **Re-writing everything she has written so far again**:
   Finally, she re-writes everything she has written so far again, which adds another 286 letters:
   \[
   286
   \]

6. **Final total**:
   Adding this to the previous total gives:
   \[
   286 + 286 = 572
   \]

Thus, the total number of letters Kayla has written is:
\[
\boxed{572}
\]",572.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. The alphabet has 26 letters.
2. Kayla writes the alphabet in full 5 times:
   - So, the total letters from this is 5 * 26 = 130 letters.
3. Then, she writes three-sixths of the alphabet once:
   - Three-sixths of the alphabet is (3/6) * 26 = 13 letters.
4. Next, she re-writes everything she has already written:
   - So, she re-writes the 130 letters from the first part and the 13 letters from the second part, which totals 130 + 13 = 143 letters.
5. After some rest, she re-writes everything she has written so far:
   - This means she writes the 143 letters again.

Now, let's add everything together:
- From the first 5 full writings: 130 letters
- From the three-sixths writing: 13 letters
- From the first re-write: 143 letters
- From the second re-write: 143 letters

So, the total number of letters written is:

Question: Sarah is practicing her multiplication tables. She writes the 2 times table five times, writes half of the 3 times table once, and then re-writes everything she has already written. After a break, she re-writes everything she has written so far. How many numbers has Sarah written in total?
Wrong answer: Sarah calculated that she wrote 10 numbers from the 2 times table (2, 4, 6, 8, 10) and 6 numbers from the 3 times table (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18), then she added them to get 16. She forgot to account for the re-writing steps correctly.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total by not properly accounting for the re-writing steps. I should have added the numbers written during the re-writing phases to the total count.

Error Keywords:
- Miscounting
- Overlooking re-writes
- Addition error

Instructions:
1. Identify the total number of items written in the first step (e.g., 2 times table).
2. Multiply the number of items by the number of times they are written.
3. Calculate the number of items written in the second step (e.g., half of the 3 times table).
4. Add the results from steps 2 and 3.
5. Account for the re-writing of all previously written items.
6. Add the total from the re-writing to the previous total.
7. Finally, account for any additional re-writes after breaks.

Advice:
- Always keep track of how many times each section is written.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion.
- Double-check each step to ensure all components are included in the final count.

Solution:
Sarah wrote 10 numbers from the 2 times table (2, 4, 6, 8, 10) five times, which is 10 x 5 = 50. She wrote half of the 3 times table (3, 6) once, which is 2. After re-writing everything, she wrote 50 + 2 = 52. After a break, she re-wrote everything again, so she wrote 52 + 52 = 104. Therefore, Sarah wrote a total of 104 numbers.

When the water is warm, Carlos swims a kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times as long. How much longer does Carlos take to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day than 9 kilometers on a cold day?",272.0,"To solve the problem, we first need to determine how long it takes Carlos to swim in both cold and warm water.

1. **Cold Water Swimming Time:**
   - Carlos swims 1 kilometer in 11 minutes.
   - Therefore, for 9 kilometers in cold water:
     \[
     \text{Time for 9 km in cold water} = 9 \text{ km} \times 11 \text{ minutes/km} = 99 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Warm Water Swimming Time:**
   - Carlos swims 1 kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times the time it takes in cold water.
   - The time for 1 kilometer in warm water is:
     \[
     \text{Time for 1 km in warm water} = 4 \times 11 \text{ minutes} + 9 \text{ minutes} = 44 \text{ minutes} + 9 \text{ minutes} = 53 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Therefore, for 7 kilometers in warm water:
     \[
     \text{Time for 7 km in warm water} = 7 \text{ km} \times 53 \text{ minutes/km} = 371 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculating the Difference:**
   - Now we need to find out how much longer it takes Carlos to swim 7 kilometers in warm water compared to swimming 9 kilometers in cold water:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Time for 7 km in warm water} - \text{Time for 9 km in cold water}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 371 \text{ minutes} - 99 \text{ minutes} = 272 \text{ minutes}

Thus, Carlos takes **272 minutes longer** to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day than he does to swim 9 kilometers on a cold day.",9.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the time Carlos takes to swim 1 kilometer in cold water:**
   - Carlos swims 1 kilometer in 11 minutes when the water is cold.

2. **Calculate the time Carlos takes to swim 1 kilometer in warm water:**
   - The time taken in warm water is 9 minutes more than four times the time taken in cold water.
   - Four times the time in cold water is \(4 \times 11 = 44\) minutes.
   - Adding 9 minutes gives \(44 + 9 = 53\) minutes.
   - So, Carlos swims 1 kilometer in warm water in 53 minutes.

What is the total weekly production for the three if they work all days of the week?",840.0,"To solve the problem, we first need to establish the speeds of Nadia, Emma, and Uma in terms of customers processed per day.

1. **Emma's Speed**: 
   - Emma processes 8 customers per day.

2. **Nadia's Speed**: 
   - Nadia operates 9 times as fast as Emma. Therefore, her speed is:
   \[
   \text{Nadia's speed} = 9 \times \text{Emma's speed} = 9 \times 8 = 72 \text{ customers per day}

1. **Total Rental Time**: Benjamin hires the bus from 2 PM to 6 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

2. **Free Hours**: He gets 2 hours free. Therefore, the paid hours are:

On average, how many pages does she have left to write per day?",11.0,"To find out how many pages Olga has left to write per day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pages she has already written**:
   Since Olga has finished writing \( \frac{3}{4} \) of her 176-page thesis, we can calculate the number of pages she has written as follows:
   \[
   \text{Pages written} = \frac{3}{4} \times 176

3. **Calculate the average number of pages she needs to write per day**:
   Olga has 4 days left to write the remaining pages. We can find the average number of pages she needs to write per day by dividing the number of pages left by the number of days remaining:
   \[
   \text{Pages per day} = \frac{\text{Pages left}}{\text{Days left}} = \frac{44}{4} = 11

   - Santiago uses 3 kilograms of flour per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he needs:
     \[
     \text{Total flour needed} = 3 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ kg}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the flour:**
   - The total cost for 21 kilograms of the more expensive flour is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of flour} = 21 \text{ kg} \times ₣14/\text{kg} = ₣294
     \]

4. **Add the cost of the bagel:**
   - The cost of the bagel is ₣4.
   - Therefore, the total cost before any discounts is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost before discount} = ₣294 + ₣4 = ₣298
     \]

5. **Apply the discount:**
   - Santiago receives a discount of ₣23 because he spent more than ₣50.
   - The total cost after the discount is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost after discount} = ₣298 - ₣23 = ₣275
     \]

Thus, the total amount Santiago has to pay is **₣275**.",275.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Santiago normally buys flour that costs ₣10 per kilogram.
2. The more expensive brand costs 40% more than the normal brand. 
   - To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we calculate 40% of ₣10:
     \[
     0.40 \times 10 = 4
     \]
   - Now, we add this to the normal price:
     \[
     10 + 4 = 14
     \]
   - So, the more expensive brand costs ₣14 per kilogram.

3. Santiago uses 3 kilograms of flour per day. For a week (7 days), he needs:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ kilograms}
   \]

4. Now, we calculate the total cost of the flour:
   \[
   21 \times 14 = 294
   \]
   - So, the total cost for the flour is ₣294.

5. Santiago also buys a bagel for ₣4. We add this to the cost of the flour:
   \[
   294 + 4 = 298
   \]
   - The total cost before any discounts is ₣298.

6. Since Santiago shopped more than ₣50, he receives a ₣23 discount. We subtract the discount from the total cost:
   \[
   298 - 23 = 275
   \]
   - So, the final amount Santiago has to pay is ₣275.

- \( B = 34 \) (students who like to bake)
- \( H = 6 \) (students who like to play hurling)
- The total number of students is \( 160 \).

   - First, we calculate two-fourths of Yusuf's score:
     \[
     \text{Two-fourths of Yusuf's score} = \frac{2}{4} \times 260 = \frac{1}{2} \times 260 = 130

Due to the flu season, 35 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.",50.0,"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of occupied beds**:
   The hospital has a total of 800 beds, and \( \frac{1}{8} \) of them are occupied.
   \[
   \text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{8} \times 800 = 100 \text{ beds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of beds out of service**:
   One-fifth of all the beds are out of service.
   \[
   \text{Out of service beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 800 = 160 \text{ beds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of available beds**:
   The total number of available beds is the total number of beds minus the occupied beds and the out of service beds.
   \[
   \text{Available beds} = 800 - 100 - 160 = 540 \text{ beds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks**:
   There are 35 patients admitted each day. In 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted is:
   \[
   \text{Total patients admitted} = 35 \times 14 = 490 \text{ patients}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks**:
   After 2 weeks, the number of occupied beds will increase by the number of patients admitted.
   \[
   \text{New occupied beds} = 100 + 490 = 590 \text{ beds}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks**:
   The total number of unoccupied beds is the total number of beds minus the new number of occupied beds.
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied beds} = 800 - 590 = 210 \text{ beds}
   \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is \( \boxed{210} \).",210.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The hospital has a total capacity of 800 beds.
2. First, we need to find out how many beds are occupied. Since 1/8 of the beds are occupied:
   \[
   \text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{8} \times 800 = 100 \text{ beds}
   \]

3. Next, we find out how many beds are out of service. One-fifth of all the beds are out of service:
   \[
   \text{Out of service beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 800 = 160 \text{ beds}
   \]

4. Now, we can calculate the total number of beds that are either occupied or out of service:
   \[
   \text{Total occupied and out of service beds} = 100 + 160 = 260 \text{ beds}
   \]

5. To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total occupied and out of service beds from the total capacity:
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied beds} = 800 - 260 = 540 \text{ beds}
   \]

6. Now, we need to account for the 35 patients admitted each day for 2 weeks (14 days):
   \[
   \text{Total patients admitted} = 35 \times 14 = 490 \text{ patients}
   \]

7. Finally, we subtract the total patients admitted from the unoccupied beds to find the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:

p1,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Andre is selling cupcakes and orange pies for a fundraiser. On Monday, he sold 24 boxes of cupcake and 16 fewer boxes of orange pie, than on Tuesday. On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday and 28 boxes of orange pie. On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the cupcake cost ₺10 and the orange pie cost ₺22, how much was Andre's average daily earning?",980.0,"To find Andre's average daily earning, we first need to determine how many boxes of cupcakes and orange pies he sold each day.

### Step 1: Determine the sales for Monday
- **Cupcakes sold on Monday**: 24 boxes
- **Orange pies sold on Monday**: Since he sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pies than on Tuesday, we need to find out how many he sold on Tuesday first.

### Step 2: Determine the sales for Tuesday
- **Cupcakes sold on Tuesday**: He sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday.
  \[
  \text{Cupcakes on Tuesday} = 24 + 11 = 35 \text{ boxes}
  \]
- **Orange pies sold on Tuesday**: He sold 28 boxes of orange pies.

### Step 3: Determine the sales for Monday's orange pies
Since he sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pies on Monday than on Tuesday:
\[
\text{Orange pies on Monday} = 28 - 16 = 12 \text{ boxes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate total sales for Monday and Tuesday
- **Monday**:
  - Cupcakes: 24 boxes
  - Orange pies: 12 boxes
- **Tuesday**:
  - Cupcakes: 35 boxes
  - Orange pies: 28 boxes

### Step 5: Calculate sales for Wednesday
On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined.
- **Total sales for Monday**:
  \[
  \text{Total on Monday} = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ boxes}
  \]
- **Total sales for Tuesday**:
  \[
  \text{Total on Tuesday} = 35 + 28 = 63 \text{ boxes}
  \]
- **Total sales for Monday and Tuesday combined**:
  \[
  \text{Total for both days} = 36 + 63 = 99 \text{ boxes}
  \]
Thus, on Wednesday, he sold 99 boxes.

### Step 6: Calculate the earnings for each day
- **Earnings for Monday**:
  \[
  \text{Earnings on Monday} = (24 \text{ cupcakes} \times 10) + (12 \text{ orange pies} \times 22)
  \]
  \[
  = 240 + 264 = 504 \text{ ₺}
  \]

- **Earnings for Tuesday**:
  \[
  \text{Earnings on Tuesday} = (35 \text{ cupcakes} \times 10) + (28 \text{ orange pies} \times 22)
  \]
  \[
  = 350 + 616 = 966 \text{ ₺}
  \]

- **Earnings for Wednesday**:
  Since he sold 99 boxes in total, we need to find out how many of each he sold. However, we can calculate the total earnings based on the average sales from the previous days.
  
  Let's assume he sold \( x \) cupcakes and \( y \) orange pies on Wednesday. We know:
  \[
  x + y = 99
  \]
  We can use the average ratio of cupcakes to orange pies from the previous days to estimate this. 

  From Monday and Tuesday:
  - Total cupcakes sold = 24 + 35 = 59
  - Total orange pies sold = 12 + 28 = 40
  - Ratio of cupcakes to total = \( \frac{59}{99} \) and orange pies to total = \( \frac{40}{99} \)

  Thus, we can estimate:
  \[
  x \approx \frac{59}{99} \times 99 = 59 \text{ cupcakes}
  \]
  \[
  y \approx \frac{40}{99} \times 99 = 40 \text{ orange pies}
  \]

  Now, we can calculate the earnings for Wednesday:
  \[
  \text{Earnings on Wednesday} = (59 \text{ cupcakes} \times 10) + (40 \text{ orange pies} \times 22)
  \]
  \[
  = 590 + 880 = 1470 \text{ ₺}
  \]

### Step 7: Calculate total earnings and average daily earnings
- **Total earnings**:
  \[
  \text{Total earnings} = 504 + 966 + 1470 = 2940 \text{ ₺}
  \]

- **Average daily earnings**:
  \[
  \text{Average daily earnings} = \frac{2940}{3} = 980 \text{ ₺}
  \]

Thus, Andre's average daily earning is **₺980**.",980.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Sales on Monday:**
   - Andre sold 24 boxes of cupcakes.
   - He sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pies than on Tuesday. 

2. **Sales on Tuesday:**
   - On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday.
   - So, the number of boxes of cupcakes sold on Tuesday is:
     \[
     24 + 11 = 35
     \]
   - He sold 28 boxes of orange pies on Tuesday.

3. **Sales on Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined.
   - First, we need to calculate the total sales from Monday and Tuesday:
     - Total boxes sold on Monday:
       - Cupcakes: 24
       - Orange pies: (since he sold 16 fewer than Tuesday, we need to find out how many he sold on Tuesday first)
       - On Tuesday, he sold 28 orange pies, so on Monday he sold:
         \[
         28 - 16 = 12
         \]
       - Total boxes sold on Monday = 24 (cupcakes) + 12 (orange pies) = 36.
     - Total boxes sold on Tuesday:
       - Cupcakes: 35
       - Orange pies: 28
       - Total boxes sold on Tuesday = 35 + 28 = 63.
     - Total boxes sold on Monday and Tuesday combined:
       \[
       36 + 63 = 99
       \]
   - Therefore, on Wednesday, he sold 99 boxes.

4. **Calculating Earnings:**
   - Now, we need to calculate the earnings for each day.
   - **Earnings on Monday:**
     - Cupcakes: 24 boxes * ₺10 = ₺240
     - Orange pies: 12 boxes * ₺22 = ₺264
     - Total earnings on Monday:
       \[
       240 + 264 = ₺504
       \]
   - **Earnings on Tuesday:**
     - Cupcakes: 35 boxes * ₺10 = ₺350
     - Orange pies: 28 boxes * ₺22 = ₺616
     - Total earnings on Tuesday:
       \[
       350 + 616 = ₺966
       \]
   - **Earnings on Wednesday:**
     - Total boxes sold on Wednesday = 99.
     - To find out how many of each he sold, we can assume he sold the same ratio as the previous days. 
     - Total boxes sold on Monday and Tuesday = 99.
     - Ratio of cupcakes to total boxes sold on Monday and Tuesday:
       - Total cupcakes sold = 24 + 35 = 59.
       - Total boxes sold = 36 + 63 = 99.
       - Ratio of cupcakes = 59/99.
       - Ratio of orange pies = 40/99 (since 99 - 59 = 40).
     - Therefore, on Wednesday:
       - Cupcakes sold = \( \frac{59}{99} \times 99 = 59 \)
       - Orange pies sold = \( \frac{40}{99} \times 99 = 40 \)
     - Earnings on Wednesday:
       - Cupcakes: 59 boxes * ₺10 = ₺590
       - Orange pies: 40 boxes * ₺22 = ₺880
       - Total earnings on Wednesday:
         \[
         590 + 880 = ₺1470
         \]

5. **Total Earnings Over Three Days:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings on Monday + Earnings on Tuesday + Earnings on Wednesday:
     \[
     504 + 966 + 1470 = ₺2940
     \]

6. **Average Daily Earnings:**
   - Average daily earnings = Total earnings / 3:

Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.

For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

[Example Input]
Question: Alex has a garden that is 120 feet long. He wants to plant trees that are 4 feet wide and needs to leave 10 feet between each tree (including the tree's width). Alex already has 5 trees. Each tree costs $10, but if he buys more than 3 trees, he will receive a $7 discount on the total purchase. How much will Alex spend to fill his garden with trees?

Wrong answer: Alex calculated that he could fit 30 trees in the garden, so he decided to buy 25 more trees. He thought the total cost would be $250, but he forgot to apply the discount.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of trees that could fit in the garden by not accounting for the total width of each tree and the spacing required between them. I also neglected to apply the discount correctly.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Spacing
- Discount application

Instructions:
1. Determine the total width occupied by each tree and the space needed between them.
2. Calculate how many trees can fit in the garden by dividing the total length by the width of each tree plus the space required.
3. Subtract the number of trees already owned from the total number of trees that can fit to find out how many more trees need to be purchased.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of trees to be purchased.
5. Check if the discount applies and adjust the total cost accordingly.

Advice:
- Always double-check the calculations for spacing and dimensions.
- Keep track of any discounts or special offers that may affect the total cost.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid confusion.

Solution:
To solve the problem, first calculate the total width for each tree and the space: 4 feet (tree width) + 10 feet (space) = 14 feet. The total number of trees that can fit is 120 feet / 14 feet = 8.57, which means 8 trees can fit. Since Alex already has 5 trees, he needs to buy 3 more. The cost for 3 trees is $30, and since he is buying more than 3 trees, he gets a $7 discount, making the total cost $23.

[Example Input]
Question: Alex has a garden that is 120 feet long. He wants to plant trees that are 4 feet wide and needs to leave 10 feet between each tree (including the tree's width). Alex already has 5 trees. Each tree costs $10, but if he buys more than 3 trees, he will receive a $7 discount on the total purchase. How much will Alex spend to fill his garden with trees?

Wrong answer: Alex calculated that he could fit 30 trees in the garden, so he decided to buy 25 more trees. He thought the total cost would be $250, but he forgot to apply the discount.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of trees that could fit in the garden by not accounting for the total width of each tree and the spacing required between them. I also neglected to apply the discount correctly.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Spacing
- Discount application

Instructions:
1. Determine the total width occupied by each tree and the space needed between them.
2. Calculate how many trees can fit in the garden by dividing the total length by the width of each tree plus the space required.
3. Subtract the number of trees already owned from the total number of trees that can fit to find out how many more trees need to be purchased.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of trees to be purchased.
5. Check if the discount applies and adjust the total cost accordingly.

Advice:
- Always double-check the calculations for spacing and dimensions.
- Keep track of any discounts or special offers that may affect the total cost.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid confusion.

Solution:
To solve the problem, first calculate the total width for each tree and the space: 4 feet (tree width) + 10 feet (space) = 14 feet. The total number of trees that can fit is 120 feet / 14 feet = 8.57, which means 8 trees can fit. Since Alex already has 5 trees, he needs to buy 3 more. The cost for 3 trees is $30, and since he is buying more than 3 trees, he gets a $7 discount, making the total cost $23.

How long will it take her to peel and saute 60 clams if it takes 19 minutes to wash all the clams? Note that Yara can't work in parallel.,53.0,"To determine how long it will take Yara to peel and saute 60 clams, we need to break down the tasks and calculate the time for each step.

1. **Washing the clams**: 
   - It takes Yara 19 minutes to wash all the clams.

2. **Peeling the clams**: 
   - Yara can peel 6 clams per minute.
   - For 60 clams, the time taken to peel them is:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel} = \frac{60 \text{ clams}}{6 \text{ clams/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Sauteing the clams**: 
   - Yara can saute 20 clams in 8 minutes.
   - To find out how long it takes to saute 60 clams, we first determine the rate of sauteing:
     \[
     \text{Rate of sauteing} = \frac{20 \text{ clams}}{8 \text{ minutes}} = 2.5 \text{ clams/minute}
     \]
   - Now, we calculate the time to saute 60 clams:
     \[
     \text{Time to saute} = \frac{60 \text{ clams}}{2.5 \text{ clams/minute}} = 24 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Total time**: 
   - Now we add the time for washing, peeling, and sauteing:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time to wash} + \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to saute}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 19 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} + 24 \text{ minutes} = 53 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time it will take Yara to wash, peel, and saute 60 clams is **53 minutes**.",53.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Washing the clams**: Yara takes 19 minutes to wash all the clams.

2. **Peeling the clams**: Yara can peel 6 clams per minute. To find out how long it takes her to peel 60 clams, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Time to peel} = \frac{60 \text{ clams}}{6 \text{ clams/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Sauteing the clams**: Yara can saute 20 clams in 8 minutes. To find out how long it takes her to saute 60 clams, we first determine how many batches of 20 clams are in 60 clams:
   \[
   \text{Number of batches} = \frac{60 \text{ clams}}{20 \text{ clams/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
   \]
   Now, we calculate the time for 3 batches:
   \[
   \text{Time to saute} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 8 \text{ minutes/batch} = 24 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Total time**: Now we add the time for washing, peeling, and sauteing:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time to wash} + \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to saute}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 19 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} + 24 \text{ minutes} = 53 \text{ minutes}

Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet. How much older is Liam's uncle than Liam?,22.0,"Let's denote the following variables:

- Let \( U \) be the age of Liam's uncle when he first saw Comet Halley.
- Let \( L \) be Liam's age when he first saw Comet Halley.
- Let \( t \) be the number of years that have passed since Liam's uncle first saw the comet.

From the problem, we know:

1. Liam's uncle saw the comet when he was 31 years old, so:
   \[
   U = 31
   \]

2. The comet orbits the Sun every 53 years, so after 53 years, Liam will see the comet again. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   t = 53
   \]

3. When Liam saw the comet for the second time, he was twice the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet. Since Liam's uncle was 31 when he first saw the comet, we can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Liam's age at second sighting} = 2 \times U = 2 \times 31 = 62
   \]

4. Since \( t = 53 \), we can express Liam's age when he first saw the comet as:
   \[
   L + 53 = 62
   \]

5. Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = 62 - 53 = 9
   \]

Now we know that Liam was 9 years old when he first saw the comet. 

Next, we can find out how much older Liam's uncle is than Liam. Since Liam's uncle was 31 years old when he first saw the comet, and Liam was 9, we can calculate the age difference:

\[
\text{Age difference} = U - L = 31 - 9 = 22
\]

Thus, Liam's uncle is \( \boxed{22} \) years older than Liam.",22.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Liam's uncle saw Comet Halley when he was 31 years old.
2. The comet orbits the Sun every 53 years, so the next time it appears after the uncle's first sighting will be 53 years later.
3. When Liam saw the comet for the second time, he was twice the age his uncle was when he first saw it. Since the uncle was 31 years old at that time, Liam would be 2 * 31 = 62 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
4. Now, we need to determine how many years have passed since the uncle first saw the comet until Liam saw it for the second time. Since the comet appears every 53 years, the uncle would be 31 + 53 = 84 years old when Liam saw it for the second time.

How many puzzle pieces did Uma place during that hour?",127.0,"To find out how many puzzle pieces Uma placed during that hour, we need to calculate the number of pieces she completed from both puzzles.

1. **Calculating pieces from the first puzzle:**
   - Uma finished one-fifth of a 420 piece puzzle.
   - To find one-fifth of 420, we calculate:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} \times 420 = \frac{420}{5} = 84
     \]
   - So, Uma placed 84 pieces from the first puzzle.

2. **Calculating pieces from the second puzzle:**
   - Uma finished one-tenth of a 430 piece puzzle.
   - To find one-tenth of 430, we calculate:
     \[
     \frac{1}{10} \times 430 = \frac{430}{10} = 43

They agree to split it with Tara getting 190 yards more than Ananya, and Umar getting 30 yards more than Tara. How much is left over for Ananya?",150.0,"Let's denote the amount of fence Ananya gets as \( A \) yards. According to the problem, Tara gets 190 yards more than Ananya, so we can express Tara's amount as:

\[
T = A + 190
\]

Umar gets 30 yards more than Tara, so we can express Umar's amount as:

\[
U = T + 30 = (A + 190) + 30 = A + 220
\]

Now, we can set up an equation for the total amount of fence:

\[
A + T + U = 860
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( T \) and \( U \) into the equation gives:

\[
A + (A + 190) + (A + 220) = 860
\]

Now, combine like terms:

\[
A + A + 190 + A + 220 = 860
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3A + 410 = 860
\]

Next, we will isolate \( A \) by subtracting 410 from both sides:

\[
3A = 860 - 410
\]
\[
3A = 450
\]

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( A \):

\[
A = \frac{450}{3} = 150
\]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find the amounts for Tara and Umar:

\[
T = A + 190 = 150 + 190 = 340
\]
\[
U = A + 220 = 150 + 220 = 370
\]

Finally, we can check the total:

\[
A + T + U = 150 + 340 + 370 = 860

This confirms our calculations are correct. 

Thus, the amount of fence left over for Ananya is:

\[
\boxed{150} \text{ yards}

1. Let the amount of fence Ananya gets be represented as \( A \).
2. According to the problem, Tara gets 190 yards more than Ananya, so we can express Tara's amount as \( T = A + 190 \).
3. Umar gets 30 yards more than Tara, so we can express Umar's amount as \( U = T + 30 = (A + 190) + 30 = A + 220 \).
4. Now we can express the total amount of fence in terms of Ananya's amount:
   \[
   A + T + U = A + (A + 190) + (A + 220)

   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   A + A + 190 + A + 220 = 3A + 410

5. We know that the total amount of fence is 860 yards, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   3A + 410 = 860

6. To find \( A \), we first subtract 410 from both sides:
   \[
   3A = 860 - 410

   \[
   3A = 450

Each class is 30 minutes long, but he spends 15 minutes before each class to review the study materials and prepare. He goes to class for 4 days a week. He then spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?",33.0,"To find out how many hours a week Santiago spends learning, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total class time for the week:**
   - Santiago has 6 periods in a day, plus 3 extra classes.
   - Each class is 30 minutes long.
   - Total classes per day = 6 (normal) + 3 (extra) = 9 classes.
   - Total class time per day = 9 classes × 30 minutes/class = 270 minutes.

2. **Calculate the total class time for 4 days:**
   - Total class time for 4 days = 270 minutes/day × 4 days = 1080 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total review time before each class:**
   - Santiago spends 15 minutes reviewing before each class.
   - Total review time per day = 9 classes × 15 minutes/class = 135 minutes.
   - Total review time for 4 days = 135 minutes/day × 4 days = 540 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total learning time during the week:**
   - Total learning time for the week = Total class time + Total review time
   - Total learning time for the week = 1080 minutes + 540 minutes = 1620 minutes.

5. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - First, we need to find out how many minutes are in a week.
   - There are 7 days in a week, and each day has 24 hours, so:
     \[
     \text{Total minutes in a week} = 7 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 10080 \text{ minutes}.
     \]
   - Santiago spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.
   - One-ninth of the weekly minutes = \( \frac{10080 \text{ minutes}}{9} = 1120 \text{ minutes} \).
   - Since he spends this amount on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:
     \[
     1120 \text{ minutes} + 1120 \text{ minutes} = 2240 \text{ minutes}.
     \]

6. **Calculate the total learning time for the week including the weekend:**
   - Total learning time for the week = Total learning time during the week + Total extra learning time
   - Total learning time for the week = 1620 minutes + 2240 minutes = 3860 minutes.

7. **Convert the total learning time from minutes to hours:**
   - To convert minutes to hours, divide by 60:
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = \frac{3860 \text{ minutes}}{60} \approx 64.33 \text{ hours}.
   \]

Thus, Santiago spends approximately **64.33 hours a week** learning.",64.33,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of periods Santiago has in a day:**
   - He has 6 normal periods.
   - He takes 3 extra classes.
   - So, the total number of periods in a day is 6 + 3 = 9 periods.

2. **Calculate the total time spent in classes each day:**
   - Each class is 30 minutes long.
   - He has 3 extra classes, so the total time for extra classes is 3 * 30 = 90 minutes.
   - The total time spent in normal classes (6 periods) is 6 * 30 = 180 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in classes each day is 180 + 90 = 270 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time spent reviewing before classes each day:**
   - He spends 15 minutes reviewing before each of the 3 extra classes.
   - So, the total review time for extra classes is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.
   - He does not review before the normal classes, so the total review time is 45 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total learning time each day:**
   - Total learning time each day = Time in classes + Review time
   - Total learning time each day = 270 minutes + 45 minutes = 315 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total learning time for 4 days a week:**
   - He goes to class for 4 days a week.
   - Total learning time for 4 days = 4 * 315 = 1260 minutes.

6. **Calculate the total weekly minutes:**
   - There are 7 days in a week, and each day has 24 hours.
   - Total minutes in a week = 7 * 24 * 60 = 10080 minutes.

7. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - He spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes on each of these days.
   - One-ninth of weekly minutes = 10080 / 9 = 1120 minutes.
   - Total extra learning time for Saturday and Sunday = 1120 + 1120 = 2240 minutes.

8. **Calculate the total learning time for the week:**
   - Total learning time for the week = Learning time for 4 days + Extra learning time for Saturday and Sunday
   - Total learning time for the week = 1260 + 2240 = 3500 minutes.

9. **Convert total learning time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Total learning time in hours = 3500 / 60 ≈ 58.33 hours.

The answer is approximately 58.33 hours.",58.33,0,1,1,33.0,"--- Beginning of the template ---

Thus, the supermarket will have received **₣220** after all the balls are sold.",220.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, we need to find the total number of each type of ball and their respective costs:
   - Blue balls: 9 balls at ₣12 each.
   - Purple balls: 11 balls at ₣9 each.
   - Pink balls: 17 balls at ₣4 each.

2. Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of ball:
   - Total cost for blue balls = 9 * 12 = ₣108.
   - Total cost for purple balls = 11 * 9 = ₣99.
   - Total cost for pink balls = 17 * 4 = ₣68.

3. Next, we add these amounts to find the total revenue before the discount:
   - Total revenue = ₣108 + ₣99 + ₣68 = ₣275.

4. The supermarket has a promotion that gives a 20% discount on all purchases. We need to calculate the discount:
   - Discount = 20% of ₣275 = 0.20 * 275 = ₣55.

5. Now, we subtract the discount from the total revenue to find the final amount received by the supermarket:
   - Final amount = ₣275 - ₣55 = ₣220.

p1,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Olivia walks 20 kilometers every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 kilometers of walking on the beach and 10 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?",75.0,"Let \( v \) be Olivia's original speed on the beach in kilometers per hour. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is \( 4v \).

Due to her injury, her speed on the beach is now \( \frac{v}{2} \) and her speed on the sidewalk is \( \frac{4v}{2} = 2v \).

We know that Olivia spends 60 minutes (or 1 hour) walking on the beach. Since she walks 10 kilometers on the beach, we can use the formula for speed:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

For the beach:

\[
1 \text{ hour} = \frac{10 \text{ km}}{\frac{v}{2}}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
1 = \frac{10 \cdot 2}{v}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
v = 20 \text{ km/h}
\]

Now, we can find Olivia's speed on the beach and sidewalk after her injury:

- Beach speed: \( \frac{v}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ km/h} \)
- Sidewalk speed: \( 2v = 2 \cdot 20 = 40 \text{ km/h} \)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for her to walk the 10 kilometers on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{10 \text{ km}}{40 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we can find the total time for her entire 20-kilometer walk:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 60 \text{ minutes} + 15 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it takes for Olivia to complete her entire 20-kilometer walk is:

\[
\boxed{75} \text{ minutes}
\]",75.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Olivia walks a total of 20 kilometers every day, which includes 10 kilometers on the beach and 10 kilometers on the sidewalk.

2. We know that on the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the speed she does on the beach. Let's denote her original speed on the beach as \( v \). Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is \( 4v \).

3. Due to her recent injury, her speed has decreased by half. So, her new speed on the beach is \( \frac{v}{2} \) and her new speed on the sidewalk is \( \frac{4v}{2} = 2v \).

4. We are told that Olivia spends 60 minutes walking on the beach. To find out how far she walks on the beach, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Since she walks for 60 minutes (1 hour) on the beach at a speed of \( \frac{v}{2} \):
   \[
   \text{Distance on the beach} = \frac{v}{2} \times 1 = \frac{v}{2} \text{ kilometers}
   \]

5. We know that the distance on the beach is 10 kilometers, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{v}{2} = 10
   \]
   Solving for \( v \):
   \[
   v = 20 \text{ kilometers per hour}
   \]

6. Now, we can find her speed on the sidewalk:
   \[
   \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2v = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ kilometers per hour}
   \]

7. Next, we need to calculate how long it takes her to walk the 10 kilometers on the sidewalk. Using the same distance formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   For the sidewalk:
   \[
   \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{10 \text{ kilometers}}{40 \text{ kilometers per hour}} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ minutes}
   \]

8. Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the entire 20-kilometer walk:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 60 \text{ minutes} + 15 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ minutes}

Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of walks per week and did not account for the tips correctly. I also failed to multiply the total earnings by the correct number of walks.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect frequency of service
- Omission of tips

Instructions:
1. Identify the total number of clients (dogs/apartments).
2. Determine the cost per service (walk/collection).
3. Calculate the total number of services provided in a week.
4. Multiply the total number of services by the cost per service to find total earnings.
5. Calculate the total tips based on the percentage of total earnings.

Solution:
Total number of apartments = 300 + 300 + (300 + 300) * 0.5 = 900 apartments. 
Total collections per week = 900 apartments * 2 collections = 1800 collections. 
Total earnings = 1800 collections * ¥0.45 = ¥810. 
Total tips = 14% of ¥810 = ¥113.40. 
Total earnings in a week = ¥810 + ¥113.40 = ¥923.40.

Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each place and he gets paid ¥0.45 per collection for each apartment. He also earns 14% on tips. How much money does he make in a week?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 4617.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I miscalculated the total number of apartments and the size of the last apartment complex. I also made an error in calculating the total collections and did not properly account for the tips. My previous answer was incorrect because I failed to accurately compute the total earnings from the collections and the tips.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect size of the last complex
- Omission of proper calculations for total earnings and tips

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the number of apartments:**
   - First two complexes: 300 apartments each = 300 + 300 = 600 apartments.
   - Last complex: 50% bigger than the first two combined.
     - Combined size of the first two = 600 apartments.
     - 50% of 600 = 300 apartments.
     - Therefore, the last complex has 600 + 300 = 900 apartments.
   - Total number of apartments = 600 + 900 = 1500 apartments.

2. **Calculate the total collections per week:**
   - Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each complex.
   - Total collections per week = Total apartments * Collections per week.
   - Total collections = 1500 apartments * 2 collections = 3000 collections.

3. **Calculate total earnings from collections:**
   - Earnings per collection = ¥0.45.
   - Total earnings = Total collections * Earnings per collection.
   - Total earnings = 3000 collections * ¥0.45 = ¥1350.

4. **Calculate total tips:**
   - Tips = 14% of total earnings.
   - Total tips = 0.14 * ¥1350 = ¥189.

5. **Calculate total earnings in a week:**
   - Total earnings in a week = Total earnings + Total tips.
   - Total earnings in a week = ¥1350 + ¥189 = ¥1539.

### Final Answer:
Oliver makes ¥1539 in a week.

### Instructions for Future Problems:
1. Carefully read the problem to identify all components (number of clients, frequency of service, payment per service).
2. Calculate the size of each client group accurately, especially when percentages or comparisons are involved.
3. Determine the total number of services provided based on the frequency of service.
4. Multiply the total number of services by the payment per service to find total earnings.
5. Calculate any additional earnings (like tips) based on the percentage of total earnings.
6. Add all components together to find the final amount earned.

### General Advice for Similar Problems:
- Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts to avoid confusion.
- Double-check calculations at each step to ensure accuracy.
- Pay close attention to percentages and how they relate to the total amounts.
- Always verify that you have included all sources of income in your final calculations.","--- Beginning of the template ---

- Always double-check the frequency of services provided.
- Ensure to include all components of earnings, including tips or bonuses.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion.

Solution:
Total number of apartments = 300 + 300 + (300 + 300) * 0.5 = 900 apartments. 
Total collections per week = 900 apartments * 2 collections = 1800 collections. 
Total earnings = 1800 collections * ¥0.45 = ¥810. 
Total tips = 14% of ¥810 = ¥113.40. 
Total earnings in a week = ¥810 + ¥113.40 = ¥923.40.

How many slices of pear did they all eat on average?",12.0,"To find the average number of slices of pear that Leilani, her sister, and her brother ate, we first need to determine how many slices each person ate.

1. **Leilani's slices**: 
   \[
   \text{Leilani ate} = 3 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Sister's slices**: 
   Her sister ate 12 more slices than Leilani:
   \[
   \text{Sister's slices} = 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Brother's slices**: 
   Her brother ate 3 more slices than her sister:
   \[
   \text{Brother's slices} = 15 + 3 = 18 \text{ slices}

Next, we find the average number of slices eaten by the three of them:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total slices eaten}}{\text{Number of people}} = \frac{36}{3} = 12 \text{ slices}

If a kilogram of trout costs $2.25, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?",738.0,"To find out how much Jin will earn after selling all the trouts, we first need to determine the weights of all the trouts he caught.

1. **Weights of the trouts:**
   - First trout: 62 kg
   - Second trout: 31 kg
   - Each of the remaining 5 trouts weighs 16 kg more than the second trout (31 kg).

   Let's calculate the weight of each of the remaining trouts:
   \[
   \text{Weight of each remaining trout} = 31 \text{ kg} + 16 \text{ kg} = 47 \text{ kg}
   \]

   Now, we can list the weights of all the trouts:
   - First trout: 62 kg
   - Second trout: 31 kg
   - Third trout: 47 kg
   - Fourth trout: 47 kg
   - Fifth trout: 47 kg
   - Sixth trout: 47 kg
   - Seventh trout: 47 kg

2. **Total weight of all trouts:**
   Now, we will calculate the total weight:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 62 + 31 + 47 + 47 + 47 + 47 + 47

   Let's calculate it step by step:
   \[
   62 + 31 = 93
   \]
   \[
   93 + 47 = 140

   \[
   140 + 47 = 187

   \[
   187 + 47 = 234

3. **Calculating the earnings:**
   The price per kilogram of trout is $2.25. Therefore, the total earnings can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Total weight} \times \text{Price per kg}

   - Weight of the first trout: 62 kg
   - Weight of the second trout: 31 kg
   - Weight of the remaining 5 trouts: \( 5 \times 47 = 235 \) kg
6. So, the total weight of all the trouts is:

If they work for 6 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?",60.0,"To determine the percentage of the maintenance worker's day spent cleaning floors, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the time taken to clean one floor after the injury:**
   - Originally, it took 6 minutes per floor.
   - Due to the injury, it now takes twice as long:
     \[
     \text{Time per floor} = 6 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 12 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time required to clean all 180 floors:**
   - Total time in minutes:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 180 \text{ floors} \times 12 \text{ minutes/floor} = 2160 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
     \[
     \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{2160 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 36 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total working hours over 10 days:**
   - The worker works for 6 hours a day for 10 days:
     \[
     \text{Total working hours} = 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 10 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ hours}

   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{36 \text{ hours}}{60 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 60\%

Thus, the maintenance worker spends **60%** of their day cleaning floors.",60.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. The maintenance worker has to clean 180 floors.
2. It normally takes them 6 minutes per floor, but due to their injury, it now takes them twice as long. So, the new time per floor is:
   \[
   6 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 12 \text{ minutes per floor}

3. To find the total time needed to clean all 180 floors, we multiply the number of floors by the time per floor:
   \[
   180 \text{ floors} \times 12 \text{ minutes per floor} = 2160 \text{ minutes}

4. Next, we need to convert the total cleaning time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
   \[
   2160 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 36 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. The maintenance worker works for 6 hours a day. To find out how many days it will take to clean all the floors, we divide the total hours by the hours worked per day:
   \[
   36 \text{ hours} \div 6 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ days}
   \]

6. Now, we need to find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning floors. Since they work 6 hours a day and spend all 6 hours cleaning, we can calculate the percentage as follows:

[Example Input]
Question: A gardener has to tend to a park with 120 trees. They have 8 days to complete the task. It takes them 5 minutes per tree. However, due to a recent illness, the gardener has become slower and it will take them 1.5 times longer to tend to each tree. If they work for 5 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent tending to the trees?
Wrong answer: I calculated that it would take 120 trees * 5 minutes = 600 minutes, which is 10 hours. Since they work 5 hours a day, I thought they would spend 10 hours in total, which is 200% of their day, so I answered 200%.
---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total time needed to tend to the trees by not accounting for the increased time per tree due to the illness. I should have multiplied the original time by 1.5 to find the correct time per tree.
Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Time management
- Percentage calculation
Instructions:
1. Determine the total number of trees and the time taken per tree.
2. Adjust the time per tree based on any changes (e.g., illness).
3. Calculate the total time needed by multiplying the number of trees by the adjusted time per tree.
4. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.
5. Determine the total working hours available over the given days.
6. Calculate the percentage of the working day spent on the task by dividing the total time spent by the total working hours and multiplying by 100.
Advice:
- Always double-check any adjustments to time calculations.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion.
- Keep track of units (minutes vs. hours) to ensure accurate calculations.
Solution:
The gardener takes 5 minutes * 1.5 = 7.5 minutes per tree. Total time = 120 trees * 7.5 minutes = 900 minutes, which is 15 hours. They work for 5 hours a day for 8 days, totaling 40 hours. The percentage of their day spent tending to trees is (15 hours / 40 hours) * 100 = 37.5%.

After Alejandro takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. Alejandro gives 1/5 of the made popcorns to his brother Tariq. How many pieces of popcorn does Alejandro have to eat?",756.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First 22 seconds**: 
   - Number of pops = 90

2. **Next 22 seconds**: 
   - Number of pops = 3 times the first amount = \(3 \times 90 = 270\)

3. **Next 22 seconds**: 
   - Number of pops = 4 times the initial amount = \(4 \times 90 = 360\)

4. **Final 22 seconds**:

   - Number of residual pops = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 180 = 45\)

6. **Total popcorn pieces**: 
   - Total popcorn = Total pops + Residual pops
   - Total popcorn = \(900 + 45 = 945\)

7. **Giving popcorn to Tariq**: 
   - Alejandro gives \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the total popcorn to Tariq.
   - Number of popcorn pieces given to Tariq = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 945 = 189\)

8. **Popcorn pieces Alejandro has left**: 
   - Number of popcorn pieces Alejandro has = Total popcorn - Popcorn given to Tariq
   - Number of popcorn pieces Alejandro has = \(945 - 189 = 756\)

Thus, the number of pieces of popcorn that Alejandro has to eat is **756**.",756.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. In the first 22 seconds, 90 kernels pop.
   - Total popped so far: 90.

2. In the next 22 seconds, the amount that pops is 3 times the first amount.
   - So, 3 * 90 = 270 kernels pop.
   - Total popped so far: 90 + 270 = 360.

3. In the next 22 seconds, the popping rate increases to 4 times the initial popping rate (which was 90).
   - So, 4 * 90 = 360 kernels pop.
   - Total popped so far: 360 + 360 = 720.

4. In the final 22 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate of the previous 22 seconds.
   - The previous rate was 360, so half of that is 360 / 2 = 180 kernels pop.
   - Total popped so far: 720 + 180 = 900.

5. After Alejandro takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds also pop from the residual heat.
   - A quarter of the final popping amount (180) is 180 / 4 = 45 kernels.
   - Total popped so far: 900 + 45 = 945.

6. Alejandro gives 1/5 of the made popcorn to his brother Tariq.
   - The amount given to Tariq is 1/5 of 945, which is 945 / 5 = 189 kernels.

7. To find out how many pieces of popcorn Alejandro has left to eat, we subtract the amount given to Tariq from the total amount popped.
   - So, 945 - 189 = 756.

If there are 40 cubes in the pyramid in total, what percentage of cubes are white?",40.0,"To find the percentage of white cubes in the pyramid, we first need to determine the total number of each type of cube.

1. **Identify the number of green cubes**: 
   - There are 4 green cubes.

2. **Identify the number of black cubes**: 
   - The number of black cubes is five times the number of green cubes. 
   - Therefore, the number of black cubes is:
     \[
     5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ black cubes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of cubes accounted for**:
   - We have:
     - Green cubes: 4
     - Black cubes: 20
   - Adding these together gives:
     \[
     4 + 20 = 24 \text{ cubes}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of white cubes**:
   - The total number of cubes in the pyramid is 40. 
   - To find the number of white cubes, we subtract the number of green and black cubes from the total:
     \[
     40 - 24 = 16 \text{ white cubes}
     \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of white cubes**:
   - The percentage of white cubes is calculated by dividing the number of white cubes by the total number of cubes and then multiplying by 100:
     \[
     \text{Percentage of white cubes} = \left( \frac{16}{40} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Simplifying the fraction:
     \[
     \frac{16}{40} = 0.4
     \]
   - Now, multiplying by 100:

- Oscar's age = \( O = 54 \) years
- Arash's age = \( A \)
- Ali's age = \( L \)

From the problem, we know the following:

1. Oscar is younger than Arash: \( O < A \)
2. Oscar is older than Ali: \( O > L \)
3. The age difference between Oscar and Arash is 27 years: 
   \[
   A - O = 27
