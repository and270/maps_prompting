She bought 6 dozen croissants which cost $19 per dozen, 4 dozen macarons which cost $77 per dozen, and 3 dozen brownies for $118 per dozen. How much was the total cost if she received 25% discount on all purchases?",582.0,"## Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the croissants
First, we need to calculate the total cost of the croissants. Beatriz bought 6 dozen croissants at $19 per dozen. So, the total cost of the croissants is 6 * $19 = $114.

## Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the macarons
Next, we calculate the total cost of the macarons. Beatriz bought 4 dozen macarons at $77 per dozen. So, the total cost of the macarons is 4 * $77 = $308.

## Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the brownies
Then, we calculate the total cost of the brownies. Beatriz bought 3 dozen brownies at $118 per dozen. So, the total cost of the brownies is 3 * $118 = $354.

## Step 4: Calculate the total cost of all the baked goods before the discount
Now, we add up the costs of all the baked goods to find the total cost before the discount. Total cost = $114 (croissants) + $308 (macarons) + $354 (brownies) = $776.

## Step 5: Calculate the total cost after applying the 25% discount
Finally, we apply the 25% discount to the total cost. The discount amount is 25% of $776, which is 0.25 * $776 = $194. So, the total cost after the discount is $776 - $194 = $582.

Beatriz bought 6 dozen croissants at $19 per dozen, so the cost of croissants is 6 * $19 = $114.
She bought 4 dozen macarons at $77 per dozen, so the cost of macarons is 4 * $77 = $308.
She also bought 3 dozen brownies at $118 per dozen, so the cost of brownies is 3 * $118 = $354.
The total cost before discount is $114 + $308 + $354 = $776.
She received a 25% discount on all purchases, so the discount amount is 25% of $776, which is 0.25 * $776 = $194.
The total cost after discount is $776 - $194 = $582.

But as I pour it, I spill 7 liters of the mango drink. To make up for that, I add 7 liters of water to the mix. What percentage of the final mix is water?",50.0,"To find the percentage of the final mix that is water, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the final mix and divide it by the total volume of the final mix.

Initially, we have 16 liters of mango drink that is one-ninth water. This means the amount of water in the mango drink is:
16 * (1/9) = 16/9 ≈ 1.78 liters

We also have 14 liters of apple drink that is one-half water. This means the amount of water in the apple drink is:
14 * (1/2) = 14/2 = 7 liters

Now, we spill 7 liters of the mango drink. Since the mango drink is one-ninth water, the amount of water spilled is:
7 * (1/9) = 7/9 ≈ 0.78 liters

After spilling, we have:
- 16 - 7 = 9 liters of mango drink left
- The amount of water left in the mango drink is: 1.78 - 0.78 = 1 liter

We then add the remaining mango drink (9 liters) to the apple drink (14 liters). Now, we add 7 liters of water to make up for the spill.

The total amount of water in the final mix is:
- Water from the mango drink: 1 liter
- Water from the apple drink: 7 liters
- Added water: 7 liters
Total water = 1 + 7 + 7 = 15 liters

The total volume of the final mix is:
- Remaining mango drink: 9 liters
- Apple drink: 14 liters
- Added water: 7 liters
Total volume = 9 + 14 + 7 = 30 liters

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the final mix that is water:
(Water in the final mix / Total volume of the final mix) * 100
= (15 / 30) * 100
= 0.5 * 100
= 50%

So, the final mix is 50% water.",50.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
First, we need to calculate the amount of water in the mango drink before spilling. Since the mango drink is one-ninth water, the amount of water in 16 liters of mango drink is 16 * (1/9) = 16/9 liters.
Now, we calculate the amount of water in the apple drink. Since the apple drink is one-half water, the amount of water in 14 liters of apple drink is 14 * (1/2) = 7 liters.
Next, we spill 7 liters of the mango drink. The amount of mango drink left is 16 - 7 = 9 liters. The amount of water in the 9 liters of mango drink is 9 * (1/9) = 1 liter.
We then add 7 liters of water to the mix to make up for the spill.
Now, let's calculate the total amount of liquid in the mix. We have 9 liters of mango drink and 14 liters of apple drink, plus the 7 liters of water we added. So, the total amount of liquid is 9 + 14 + 7 = 30 liters.
The total amount of water in the mix is the sum of the water from the mango drink, the apple drink, and the added water. This equals 1 liter (from the mango drink) + 7 liters (from the apple drink) + 7 liters (added water) = 15 liters.
To find the percentage of the final mix that is water, we divide the total amount of water by the total amount of liquid and multiply by 100. This gives (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.

If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 10 hours if she spends 2/5 of the time running, 1/2 of the time skipping, and the remaining of the time walking?",27.0,"## Step 1: Determine Mei's running speed
Since Mei can skip at 2 miles per hour and she can skip at a rate of speed that is 1/2 as fast as she can run, we can calculate her running speed. If skipping is 1/2 as fast as running, then running speed is 2 times skipping speed. So, her running speed is 2 * 2 = 4 miles per hour.

## Step 2: Determine Mei's walking speed
Given that Mei can run four times faster than she can walk, we can calculate her walking speed. If running speed is 4 times walking speed, then walking speed is 1/4 of running speed. So, her walking speed is 4 / 4 = 1 mile per hour.

## Step 3: Calculate the time spent on each activity
Mei spends 2/5 of the time running, 1/2 of the time skipping, and the remaining time walking. The total time is 10 hours.
- Time spent running = 2/5 * 10 = 4 hours.
- Time spent skipping = 1/2 * 10 = 5 hours.
- Time spent walking = 10 - (4 + 5) = 1 hour.

## Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled for each activity
- Distance run = running speed * time spent running = 4 * 4 = 16 miles.
- Distance skipped = skipping speed * time spent skipping = 2 * 5 = 10 miles.
- Distance walked = walking speed * time spent walking = 1 * 1 = 1 mile.

Total distance = distance run + distance skipped + distance walked = 16 + 10 + 1 = 27 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$",27.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Mei spends 2/5 of the time running, which is (2/5) * 10 = 4 hours.
In 4 hours of running, she covers 4 * 4 = 16 miles.
Mei spends 1/2 of the time skipping, which is (1/2) * 10 = 5 hours.
In 5 hours of skipping, she covers 5 * 2 = 10 miles.
The remaining time spent walking is 10 - 4 - 5 = 1 hour.

If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?",180.0,"To determine how many ounces of cookies you can eat, we first need to calculate how many calories you have left for the day.

1. **Calculate remaining daily calorie allowance:**
   - Daily calorie target: 2300 calories
   - Calories already consumed: 1200 calories
   - Calories burned from exercise: 100 calories
   - Net calories consumed (including exercise): 1200 - 100 = 1100 calories
   - Remaining calories for the day: 2300 - 1100 = 1200 calories

2. **Determine the calorie content per ounce of cookies:**
   - Total calories per serving: 200 calories
   - Total servings in the bag: 5 servings
   - Total ounces in the bag: 150 oz
   - Calories per ounce: Since there are 5 servings in 150 oz, first find out how many ounces are in one serving.
     - Ounces per serving: 150 oz / 5 servings = 30 oz per serving
     - Calories per ounce: 200 calories / 30 oz = approximately 6.67 calories per ounce

3. **Calculate how many ounces you can eat within your remaining calorie limit:**
   - Remaining calories: 1200 calories
   - Calories per ounce of cookies: 6.67 calories
   - Ounces you can eat: 1200 calories / 6.67 calories per ounce = approximately 180 ounces

However, this calculation seems to allow for the entire bag and more, which doesn't make sense given the context. Let's revisit the calculation with a focus on the actual question:

Given that you have 1200 calories left and each serving of cookies is 200 calories, and knowing that the bag contains 5 servings:

- **Servings you can afford:**
  - Remaining calories: 1200 calories
  - Calories per serving: 200 calories
  - Servings you can eat: 1200 / 200 = 6 servings

But since the bag only has 5 servings, you can eat up to 5 servings if you want to stay within your calorie limit or less if you plan to consume other foods.

- **Ounces per serving:**
  - Total ounces: 150 oz
  - Total servings: 5 servings
  - Ounces per serving: 150 oz / 5 servings = 30 oz per serving

Given that you can eat up to 6 servings based on calories but the bag only contains 5 servings, and each serving is 30 oz:

- **Total ounces you can eat:**
  - Since you can eat up to 5 servings and each serving is 30 oz, you can eat up to 5 * 30 = 150 oz if you only consider the cookie's calorie contribution and don't exceed your daily limit with other foods.

However, considering the initial miscalculation and focusing on the precise question: if you aim to use your remaining 1200 calories for cookies and possibly other foods, you should calculate based on the calorie limit directly related to the cookies' servings.

Given the direct calculation approach and focusing on not exceeding the daily calorie limit with the cookies as part of the diet, the error was in overcomplicating the calculation. The direct approach should consider how many servings (and thus ounces) of cookies you can eat within your remaining calorie budget, acknowledging that the entire bag represents 5 servings.

Thus, the correct approach simplifies to calculating how many of the 5 servings (each 30 oz) you can consume within your remaining calorie allowance, ensuring not to exceed your daily limit when including these cookies as part of your diet. 

Given this, if you decide to allocate your remaining 1200 calories to the cookies, considering each serving is 200 calories:

- You can have up to 6 servings based on calories (1200 / 200 = 6), but since the bag only has 5 servings, you're limited to those.
- Each serving is 30 oz (150 oz / 5 servings), so for 5 servings, you'd be eating 150 oz.

This means, based on the calorie allowance and the servings available, you could technically eat the entire bag if you're not consuming anything else, but this doesn't account for the practicality of saving calories for other foods or activities. The calculation aimed to determine the maximum based on the given calorie target and consumption, highlighting the importance of balancing dietary intake.",150.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
First, we need to calculate how many calories you have already consumed or burned in total, including the exercise.
You have consumed 1200 calories and burned 100 calories through exercise.
So, the net calories you've consumed is 1200 - 100 = 1100 calories.
Your daily calorie target is 2300 calories.
So, the number of calories you can still consume is 2300 - 1100 = 1200 calories.
Each serving of the cookies has 200 calories.
The number of servings you can eat is 1200 / 200 = 6 servings.
Since the 150 oz bag has 5 servings, each serving is 150 / 5 = 30 oz.
So, the number of oz you can eat is 6 servings * 30 oz/serving = 180 oz, but since the bag only has 150 oz, you can eat the whole bag which is 150 oz or less if you want to stay under your calorie target for the day with other foods.
The answer is 150.",150.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
First, we need to calculate how many calories are left in the daily target after consuming 1200 calories and exercising for 100 calories.
The daily calorie target is 2300 calories.
Calories already consumed are 1200 calories.
Calories burned from exercise are 100 calories.
So, the net calories consumed are 1200 - 100 = 1100 calories.
Calories left for the day are 2300 - 1100 = 1200 calories.

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in the bag of cookies per ounce.
The bag has 200 calories per serving.
There are 5 servings in the 150 oz bag.
So, the total calories in the bag are 200 * 5 = 1000 calories.
To find calories per ounce, we divide total calories by total ounces: 1000 calories / 150 oz = 1000/150 = 6.67 calories per oz.

Now, we need to determine how many ounces can be eaten within the remaining calorie limit.
The remaining calorie limit is 1200 calories.
Each ounce of cookies has approximately 6.67 calories.
So, the number of ounces that can be eaten is 1200 / 6.67 = 180 oz.

However, this calculation does not take into account the serving size or the total amount of cookies available. Since the question asks how many oz can be eaten, we must consider the total amount of cookies (150 oz) and the daily calorie limit (2300 calories), and we've already calculated the calories per oz. Given the remaining calorie allowance (1200 calories) and the calories per oz (6.67), the calculation directly provides the amount that can be consumed without exceeding the calorie limit, but it must also be within the physical limit of the bag (150 oz). The calculation of 180 oz exceeds the physical amount available (150 oz), indicating an error in interpreting the result in the context of the question's constraints.

Correcting the interpretation:
Given that we have 1200 calories left and each ounce of cookies provides approximately 6.67 calories, the direct calculation of 1200 / 6.67 gives us the ounces that can be consumed within the calorie limit. However, the error was in not properly considering the implications of this calculation in the context of the available cookies and the misunderstanding of the initial answer.

The correct approach directly calculates how many ounces can be consumed based on the calorie limit without needing to consider the total ounces in the bag as a limiting factor in this step, since the question essentially asks how much of the bag can be eaten given the calorie constraint, not the physical constraint of the bag's size.

The total amount of ingredients used is the sum of the teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, which equals 760. So, 63x + 14x + 9y = 760.

## Step 6: Substitute y with 2x in the total equation
Substitute y = 2x into the equation: 63x + 14x + 9(2x) = 760.

## Step 7: Simplify and solve the equation
Combine like terms: 63x + 14x + 18x = 760, which simplifies to 95x = 760. Then, solve for x: x = 760 / 95 = 8.

## Step 8: Calculate the amount of sugar used
Now that we have x, we can calculate the amount of sugar used: 63x = 63 * 8 = 504 teaspoons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{504}$",504.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 63:14.
This means that for every 63 teaspoons of sugar, Fatima uses 14 cups of water.
We also know that for every 7 cups of water, she uses 9 tablespoons of milk.
First, we need to find the total amount of each ingredient in terms of one variable. 
Let's assume the number of times the ratio of sugar to water is multiplied by x. 
So, the amount of sugar is 63x teaspoons, and the amount of water is 14x cups.
Since 14x cups of water are used, and 9 tablespoons of milk are used for every 7 cups of water, 
the amount of milk used can be calculated by first determining how many times 14x is multiplied by 7 
to get the total amount of milk used: (14x) / 7 * 9 = 18x tablespoons of milk.
Now, the total amount of ingredients used is 63x (sugar) + 14x (water) + 18x (milk) = 760.
Combining like terms, we get 95x = 760.
Dividing both sides by 95, we find x = 760 / 95 = 8.
The amount of sugar used is 63x = 63 * 8 = 504 teaspoons.

We know that Rania bought a package of spoons, but we don't know how many spoons were in it.

## Step 2: Rania's husband bought a package of 17 new spoons.
This adds to the total number of spoons Rania has.

## Step 3: Rania used 11 spoons to sample her shrimp scampi.
This reduces the total number of spoons she has.

## Step 4: The guests brought 3 packs of spoons, each having 13 spoons inside them.
This adds to the total number of spoons Rania has. Since there are 3 packs, each with 13 spoons, the total number of spoons the guests brought is 3 * 13 = 39.

## Step 5: When Rania went to set the table, she had a total of 86 spoons.
We can set up an equation to represent the total number of spoons Rania has: x (the spoons Rania bought) + 17 (the spoons her husband bought) - 11 (the spoons Rania used) + 39 (the spoons the guests brought) = 86.

## Step 6: Now, let's write the equation based on the information from step 5 and solve for x.

44 oranges / 0.5 square meters = 88 oranges per square meter

Since Jin has 55 square meters of orange field, the total number of oranges he can harvest in one harvest is:

88 oranges/square meter * 55 square meters = 4840 oranges

Jin can harvest his oranges every 12 months. So, in one year, he can harvest his oranges once. In 2 years, he can harvest them twice.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the rulers.
6 rulers x ₣9.0 each = 6 x 9.0 = ₣54.00

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the rim of bond paper.

1. **Calculate the total lost income if Isabella does her taxes herself:**
   - She loses 12 hours of consulting work due to preparing taxes.
   - Additionally, she spends 3 hours mailing the documents, which also counts as lost consulting time.
   - Total lost consulting time = 12 hours (preparing taxes) + 3 hours (mailing documents) = 15 hours.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row?,43.75,"## Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 on a 20-sided die.
To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 10, we first need to know how many numbers from 1 to 20 are greater than 10. Since there are 10 numbers (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20) greater than 10, the probability is 10/20 or 1/2.

## Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row on a 20-sided die.
The probability of rolling an odd number on a 20-sided die is 10/20, since there are 10 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19) out of 20. To find the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row, we raise this probability to the power of 4, because each roll is independent. So, the probability is (10/20)^4 = (1/2)^4 = 1/16.

## Step 3: Calculate the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 10 and rolling four odd numbers in a row.
The probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is 1/2, and the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row is 1/16. The difference in probability is 1/2 - 1/16.

## Step 4: Convert the difference in probability to a percentage.
To find the difference, we first need a common denominator, which is 16. So, we convert 1/2 to 8/16. The difference is 8/16 - 1/16 = 7/16. To express this as a percentage, we divide 7 by 16 and multiply by 100: (7/16) * 100 = 43.75%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43.75}$",43.75,1,"Let's think step by step.
To determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll four odd numbers in a row, we first need to calculate the probability of each event.
The probability of rolling a number greater than 10 on a 20-sided die can be found by counting the numbers greater than 10 (which are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20) and dividing by the total number of outcomes (20). There are 10 numbers greater than 10.
So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5.
The probability of rolling an odd number on a 20-sided die is the number of odd outcomes (10, since half of the numbers from 1 to 20 are odd) divided by the total number of outcomes (20), which is 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5.
Since Luis needs to roll four odd numbers in a row, and each roll is independent, we multiply the probability of rolling an odd number by itself four times: (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = (1/2)^4 = 1/16 = 0.0625.
To find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll four odd numbers in a row, we subtract the probability of rolling four odd numbers from the probability of rolling a number greater than 10: 0.5 - 0.0625 = 0.4375.
To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.4375 * 100 = 43.75%.

Yuki started with 8 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 4 of them, so he has 8 - 4 = 4 pen pals left.

2. Next, let's calculate the total number of letters Yuki receives and sends per week:
Each pen pal sends 3 letters a week, and Yuki responds in kind. So, the total number of letters exchanged per week is 3 * 2 * 4 = 24 letters.

3. Since each letter is 10 pages long, the total number of pages exchanged per week is:

Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of letters he receives per day from each person is 3 / 7 = 0.4286 (approximately), but since he receives letters from 4 people, the total number of letters he receives per day is 4 * 3 / 7 = 1.7143 (approximately).
Each letter is 10 pages long, so the total number of pages he receives per day is 1.7143 * 10 = 17.143 (approximately).

Selling price = $500,000
Discount = 10% of $500,000 = 0.10 * $500,000 = $50,000
Selling price after discount = $500,000 - $50,000 = $450,000

Mateo also has to pay 35% as income tax. How much money did Mateo make after tax in September if the company performed very well for the whole month?",1703.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total hours Mateo works in a week.
Mateo works 6 hours a day, 3 days a week. So, the total hours he works in a week is 6 hours/day * 3 days/week = 18 hours/week.

### Step 2: Calculate Mateo's weekly earnings before tax and bonus.
Mateo earns ₣25 per hour. So, his earnings before tax and bonus in a week is 18 hours/week * ₣25/hour = ₣450/week.

### Step 3: Add the weekly bonus to Mateo's earnings.
Mateo gets a ₣205 bonus each week if the company performs well. So, his total weekly earnings before tax is ₣450/week + ₣205/week = ₣655/week.

1. **Calculate the cost per person for the activities:**
   - Laser tag: €6 per person
   - Pinball tokens: €4 per person
   - Roller coaster: €10 per ride, and each person will ride 3 times, so €10 * 3 = €30 per person
   - Total cost per person for activities: €6 (laser tag) + €4 (pinball) + €30 (roller coaster) = €40 per person

2. **Calculate the total budget available for activities (after accounting for the bus rental):**
   - Total budget: €180
   - Bus rental cost: €60
   - Budget left for activities: €180 - €60 = €120

3. **Determine how many people can be included in the party:**
   - Since Emma is also participating, we need to include her in the total number of people.
   - Let's denote the number of friends Emma can invite as \(F\). The total number of people (including Emma) will be \(F + 1\).
   - The total cost for all activities for \(F + 1\) people is \((F + 1) \times €40\).
   - This total cost must be less than or equal to the budget left for activities (€120).

So, we set up the equation:

Solving for \(F\):
\[40F + 40 \leq 120\]
\[40F \leq 80\]
\[F \leq 2\]

   - Pineapples = 44

   Now, the total number of pineapples is:
   - Pineapples = 200 (initial) + 44 (bought)
   - Pineapples = 244

5. Later, Theo buys 13 more pineapples. So, the total number of pineapples becomes:

He also bought 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis he bought, which is 63 - 19 = 44 pineapples.
So, the new number of pineapples is 200 + 44 = 244.
Later, he bought 13 more pineapples, making the total number of pineapples 244 + 13 = 257.
He also bought 22 fewer than two times as many kiwis, which is (2 * 13) - 22 = 26 - 22 = 4 kiwis.
So, the new number of kiwis is 88 + 4 = 92.
The total number of pineapples and kiwis combined is 257 + 92 = 349.

At the gift shop, saltwater taffy was on sale for ""Buy 16 kgs at $23 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/2 off."" She scooped up 23 kgs. She also bought a mixed bag of starfish for $11.0 and 17 keychains that were $20.0 each. Ananya then donated $5 at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Ananya have left?",361.0,"To find out how much money Ananya has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract that from the initial $1200.

1. **Calculate the cost of the saltwater taffy:**
   - Ananya bought 23 kgs of saltwater taffy.
   - The deal is ""Buy 16 kgs at $23 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/2 off.""
   - First, calculate the cost for the first 16 kgs: 16 kgs * $23/kg = $368.
   - Then, she gets 4 kgs at half off. Half off of $23/kg is $11.50/kg. So, for the next 4 kgs (since she bought 23 kgs in total), the cost is 4 kgs * $11.50/kg = $46.
   - The remaining 3 kgs (23 kgs total - 16 kgs - 4 kgs) are bought at the full price of $23/kg. So, 3 kgs * $23/kg = $69.
   - The total cost for the saltwater taffy is $368 + $46 + $69 = $483.

2. **Calculate the cost of the mixed bag of starfish and the keychains:**
   - The mixed bag of starfish costs $11.0.
   - 17 keychains at $20.0 each will be 17 * $20 = $340.
   - The total cost for these items is $11.0 + $340 = $351.

3. **Add the donation:**
   - Ananya donated $5 at a charity stand.

4. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Total spent on saltwater taffy = $483.
   - Total spent on starfish and keychains = $351.
   - Donation = $5.
   - Total amount spent = $483 + $351 + $5 = $839.

5. **Calculate how much money Ananya has left:**
   - Initial amount = $1200.
   - Total spent = $839.
   - Amount left = $1200 - $839 = $361.

For the remaining 7 kgs (since 23 - 16 = 7), she gets 4 kgs at half off and 3 kgs at full price. 
The 4 kgs at half off would be 4 * ($23 / 2) = 4 * $11.50 = $46.
The 3 kgs at full price would be 3 * $23 = $69.
So, the total cost for the saltwater taffy is $368 + $46 + $69 = $483.
She also buys a mixed bag of starfish for $11.
And she buys 17 keychains at $20 each, so that's 17 * $20 = $340.
The total cost for all items is $483 + $11 + $340 = $834.
Then, she donates $5 at a charity stand, making the total amount spent $834 + $5 = $839.

Andre spent $100 and got 4 bags of crackers, 7 packs of pretzels, and had 3% of his money left in change. How many gum did he buy?",45.0,"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent on crackers.
- The cost of one bag of crackers is $0.75.
- Andre bought 4 bags of crackers.
- Total spent on crackers = 4 * $0.75 = $3.

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount spent on pretzels.
- The cost of one pack of pretzels is $7.
- Andre bought 7 packs of pretzels.
- Total spent on pretzels = 7 * $7 = $49.

### Step 3: Determine the total amount spent, including the change.
- Andre spent $100 and had 3% of his money left as change.
- The amount left as change = 3% of $100 = 0.03 * $100 = $3.
- Therefore, the total amount spent = $100 - $3 = $97.

### Step 4: Calculate the amount spent on gum.
- Total spent on crackers and pretzels = $3 (crackers) + $49 (pretzels) = $52.
- Amount spent on gum = Total amount spent - Total spent on crackers and pretzels.
- Amount spent on gum = $97 - $52 = $45.

### Step 5: Determine the number of gum packs bought.
- The cost of one pack of gum is $1 (or 100 cents).
- Number of gum packs bought = Amount spent on gum / Cost per pack of gum.
- Number of gum packs bought = $45 / $1 = 45.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$",45.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
First, we need to calculate the total amount Andre spent on crackers and pretzels.
The cost of 4 bags of crackers is 4 * 75 cents = 300 cents = $3.

So, the total amount spent on crackers and pretzels is $3 + $49 = $52.
Andre spent $100 in total and had 3% of his money left as change.
The amount of change is 3% of $100, which is 0.03 * $100 = $3.
This means Andre actually spent $100 - $3 = $97.
Since he spent $52 on crackers and pretzels, the amount spent on gum is $97 - $52 = $45.
Each pack of gum costs 100 cents = $1.
So, the number of gum packs Andre bought is $45 / $1 = 45.

If the length of his room is 16 feet longer that its width, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?",68.0,"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width and length of the room. 

Let's call the width of the room ""w"" and the length ""l"". We are given that the length is 16 feet longer than the width, so we can write:

l = w + 16

We are also given that the area of the room is 225 square feet. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

Area = length × width
225 = l × w

Substituting the expression for l in terms of w, we get:

225 = (w + 16) × w

Expanding the right-hand side, we get:

225 = w^2 + 16w

Rearranging the equation to form a quadratic equation, we get:

w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0

Factoring the quadratic equation, we get:

(w + 25)(w - 9) = 0

This gives us two possible values for w: w = -25 (which is not possible since width cannot be negative) and w = 9.

So, the width of the room is 9 feet. Now we can find the length:

l = w + 16
= 9 + 16
= 25

Now that we have the width and length, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)
= 2 × (25 + 9)
= 2 × 34
= 68

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 68 feet.",68.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
The area of Kai's rectangular office is given as 225 square feet.
We are also told that the length of his room is 16 feet longer than its width. Let's denote the width as W and the length as L. So, we have L = W + 16.
The formula for the area of a rectangle is Area = Length * Width. We can substitute the given values and the relationship between L and W into this formula: 225 = L * W.
Substituting L = W + 16 into the area formula gives us 225 = (W + 16) * W.
This equation simplifies to 225 = W^2 + 16W.
Rearranging the equation into a standard quadratic form, we get W^2 + 16W - 225 = 0.
We can solve this quadratic equation for W. Let's use the quadratic formula, W = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a, where a = 1, b = 16, and c = -225.
Plugging the values into the quadratic formula gives us W = [-16 ± sqrt(16^2 - 4*1*(-225))] / (2*1).
This simplifies to W = [-16 ± sqrt(256 + 900)] / 2, which further simplifies to W = [-16 ± sqrt(1156)] / 2.
So, W = [-16 ± 34] / 2. This gives us two possible values for W: W = [-16 + 34] / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9, or W = [-16 - 34] / 2 = -50 / 2 = -25. Since the width cannot be negative, we discard W = -25.
Thus, the width of the room is 9 feet. Given that the length is 16 feet longer than the width, the length L = 9 + 16 = 25 feet.
The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width). Substituting the values we found gives us Perimeter = 2 * (25 + 9).
So, the perimeter is 2 * 34 = 68 feet.

First, we need to find the total length of all the remoras attached to the shark. Since there are 15 remoras, each 15 inches long, we calculate the total length as 15 remoras * 15 inches/remora = 225 inches.

## Step 2: Convert the shark's length to inches
To compare the lengths, we need to have the same units. The shark is 75 feet long, and since 1 foot = 12 inches, the shark's length in inches is 75 feet * 12 inches/foot = 900 inches.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of remoras that go away
1/5 of the remoras leave, so we calculate the number of remoras that go away as 1/5 * 15 remoras = 3 remoras.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of remoras that stay
The number of remoras that stay is the initial number minus the ones that left, which is 15 remoras - 3 remoras = 12 remoras.

The combined length of the remaining remoras is 12 remoras * 15 inches/remora = 180 inches.

To find the percentage, we divide the combined length of the remaining remoras by the shark's length and then multiply by 100. So, (180 inches / 900 inches) * 100 = 20%.

The shark has 15 remoras attached to it.
Each remora is 15 inches long.
First, we need to find the total length of all the remoras in inches: 15 remoras * 15 inches/remora = 225 inches.
Since 1/5 of the remoras go away, the number of remoras that leave is 15 * 1/5 = 3 remoras.
So, the number of remoras that stay is 15 - 3 = 12 remoras.
The total length of the remaining remoras is 12 remoras * 15 inches/remora = 180 inches.
Now, we need to convert the shark's body length from feet to inches because the length of the remoras is in inches. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the shark's body length in inches is 75 feet * 12 inches/foot = 900 inches.
To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remaining remoras represents, we use the formula: (length of remoras / length of shark) * 100.
So, (180 inches / 900 inches) * 100 = 20%.

How many tubes of paint does Andre have?",96.0,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

## Step 1: Calculate the number of tubes of pink paint Yuki has.
Yuki has 2/4 as many tubes of pink paint as Sanjay. Since Sanjay has 10 tubes of pink paint, Yuki has (2/4) * 10 = 5 tubes of pink paint.

## Step 2: Calculate the number of tubes of blue paint Yuki has.
Yuki has thrice as many tubes of blue paint as Sanjay. Since Sanjay has 3 tubes of blue paint, Yuki has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of blue paint.

## Step 3: Calculate the combined number of pink tubes that Sanjay and Yuki have.
Sanjay has 10 tubes of pink paint, and Yuki has 5 tubes of pink paint. So, the combined number of pink tubes is 10 + 5 = 15.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of tubes of black paint Andre has.
Andre has six times as many tubes of black paint as the combined number of pink tubes that Sanjay and Yuki have. Since the combined number of pink tubes is 15, Andre has 6 * 15 = 90 tubes of black paint.

Sanjay has 3 tubes of blue paint, and Yuki has 9 tubes of blue paint. So, the combined number of blue tubes is 3 + 9 = 12.

## Step 6: Calculate the number of tubes of white paint Andre has.
Andre has 6 fewer tubes of white paint than the combined number of blue tubes that Sanjay and Yuki have. Since the combined number of blue tubes is 12, Andre has 12 - 6 = 6 tubes of white paint.

## Step 7: Calculate the total number of tubes of paint Andre has.
Andre has 90 tubes of black paint and 6 tubes of white paint. So, the total number of tubes of paint Andre has is 90 + 6 = 96.

2. Calculate the number of crackers Deshawn has after eating a third of them.
3. Subtract the total number of crackers that the bowls and plates can hold from the number of crackers Deshawn has after eating.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of crackers that the bowls and plates can hold.
Each bowl can hold 21 crackers, and each plate can hold two times that, which is 2 * 21 = 42 crackers.
Deshawn has 11 bowls and 4 plates.
The total number of crackers the bowls can hold is 11 * 21 = 231 crackers.
The total number of crackers the plates can hold is 4 * 42 = 168 crackers.

Next, we calculate the total number of crackers that the bowls can hold. Deshawn has 11 bowls, and each bowl can hold 21 crackers, so the total number of crackers the bowls can hold is 11 * 21 = 231 crackers.
Then, we calculate the total number of crackers that the plates can hold. Deshawn has 4 plates, and each plate can hold 42 crackers, so the total number of crackers the plates can hold is 4 * 42 = 168 crackers.
Now, we find the total number of crackers that the bowls and plates can hold together, which is 231 + 168 = 399 crackers.
Deshawn starts with 615 crackers and eats a third of them. To find out how many crackers he eats, we calculate 615 / 3 = 205 crackers.
So, after eating, Deshawn has 615 - 205 = 410 crackers left.
Since the bowls and plates can hold a total of 399 crackers, and Deshawn has 410 crackers left, the number of crackers he won't be able to place on the bowls or plates is 410 - 399 = 11 crackers.

Each cow eats as much as a goat and alpaca eat combined. If there are 21 goats, 7 alpacas, and 21 cows, how many kilograms of grain does Alejandro need?",798.0,"To find the total amount of grain Alejandro needs, we first need to determine the amount of grain each type of animal needs.

1. **Goats**: Each goat needs 9 kilograms of grain.
2. **Alpacas**: Each alpaca needs 3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs. 
   - Twice the amount each goat needs is 2 * 9 = 18 kilograms.
   - 3 kilograms less than that is 18 - 3 = 15 kilograms per alpaca.
3. **Cows**: Each cow eats as much as a goat and an alpaca eat combined.
   - A goat eats 9 kilograms, and an alpaca eats 15 kilograms.
   - Combined, that's 9 + 15 = 24 kilograms per cow.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of grain needed for each type of animal:

- **Goats**: 21 goats * 9 kilograms/goat = 189 kilograms
- **Alpacas**: 7 alpacas * 15 kilograms/alpaca = 105 kilograms
- **Cows**: 21 cows * 24 kilograms/cow = 504 kilograms

Finally, to find the total amount of grain Alejandro needs, we add up the amounts needed for each type of animal:

Due to the flu season, 35 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.",50.0,"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of beds that are occupied.
2. Calculate the number of beds that are out of service.
3. Calculate the total number of beds that are not available (occupied or out of service).
4. Calculate the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks.
5. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.

Let's start:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of beds that are occupied.
The hospital has 800 beds with 1/8 occupied.
Number of occupied beds = (1/8) * 800 = 100 beds.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of beds that are out of service.
One-fifth of all the beds are out of service.
Number of beds out of service = (1/5) * 800 = 160 beds.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of beds that are not available (occupied or out of service).
Total number of beds not available = Number of occupied beds + Number of beds out of service
= 100 + 160
= 260 beds.

### Step 4: Calculate the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks.
35 patients are admitted each day. There are 7 days in a week and we are considering 2 weeks.
Total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks = 35 * 7 * 2
= 35 * 14
= 490 patients.

### Step 5: Calculate the initial number of unoccupied beds.
Total number of beds = 800
Total number of beds not available initially = 260
Initial number of unoccupied beds = Total number of beds - Total number of beds not available
= 800 - 260
= 540 beds.

### Step 6: Calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks, considering the new admissions.
After admitting 490 new patients, the number of unoccupied beds will decrease by 490.
Number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = Initial number of unoccupied beds - Total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks

The number of beds that are neither occupied nor out of service is 800 - 100 - 160 = 540 beds.
Over 2 weeks (14 days), the hospital admits 35 patients per day, so the total number of patients admitted is 35 * 14 = 490 patients.

Half of the volleyball players are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the competition?",62.0,"To find out how many students are leaving early, we need to calculate the number of volleyball players, robotics club members or choir members, and then add the cheerleaders.

## Step 1: Calculate the number of volleyball players
First, calculate 24% of 125 to find the number of volleyball players. 24% of 125 = 0.24 * 125 = 30.

## Step 2: Calculate the number of volleyball players who are present
Since half of the volleyball players are absent, we need to find half of 30. Half of 30 = 30 / 2 = 15. So, 15 volleyball players are present.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of remaining students after removing volleyball players
The total number of students minus the volleyball players gives us the remaining students. Remaining students = 125 - 30 = 95.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of robotics club members or choir members
40% of the remaining students are robotics club members or choir members. 40% of 95 = 0.40 * 95 = 38.

## Step 5: Calculate the total number of students leaving early for the competition (excluding cheerleaders)
Add the number of present volleyball players to the number of robotics club members or choir members. Total students leaving early (excluding cheerleaders) = 15 (volleyball) + 38 (robotics or choir) = 53.

## Step 6: Calculate the total number of cheerleaders accompanying the groups
Since there are 3 groups (volleyball, robotics, and choir), and each group has 3 cheerleaders, the total number of cheerleaders = 3 * 3 = 9.

## Step 7: Calculate the total number of students leaving early including cheerleaders
Add the total number of students leaving early (excluding cheerleaders) to the total number of cheerleaders. Total students leaving early including cheerleaders = 53 (students) + 9 (cheerleaders) = 62.

First, we need to find out how many students are volleyball players.

So, there are 30 volleyball players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are not volleyball players.
The number of non-volleyball players is 125 - 30 = 95 students.

Then, we calculate 40% of the remaining 95 students to find out how many are robotics club members or choir members.
40% of 95 = 0.4 * 95 = 38 students.
So, there are 38 robotics club members or choir members.

However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a €5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Mei spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",22.0,"To determine how much money Mei will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to calculate how many plants she needs to buy.

1. **Calculate the total space each plant occupies**: Each plant is 3 feet wide, and Mei needs to leave 13 feet between every plant. So, the total space each plant occupies (including the space between plants) is 3 feet (plant width) + 13 feet (space between plants) = 16 feet. However, for the last plant, there won't be an additional 13 feet of space needed after it, so we consider the space each plant takes up as 16 feet for all but the last one.

2. **Calculate the total number of plants that can fit**: The flower bed is 143 feet long. To find out how many plants Mei can fit, we divide the total length by the space each plant occupies. However, since the last plant won't have the additional 13 feet of space after it, we should consider the effective space for the first plant and all subsequent spaces between plants.

   - Let's calculate the number of plants (N) that can fit in the bed, considering the space each plant takes (including the gap after it, except for the last plant):
     - For N plants, the total length used would be: 3 (first plant) + (N-1)*16 (since each subsequent plant adds 16 feet of space, including the 13 feet gap).
     - The equation becomes: 3 + (N-1)*16 = 143.
     - Simplifying: 3 + 16N - 16 = 143.
     - Further simplifying: 16N - 13 = 143.
     - Adding 13 to both sides: 16N = 156.
     - Dividing by 16: N = 156 / 16 = 9.75.
     - Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, Mei can fit 9 plants in her flower bed (as the 10th plant would exceed the length of the bed).

3. **Determine how many plants Mei needs to buy**: Mei already owns 8 flowers, and she needs 9 to fill the bed. Therefore, she needs to buy 9 - 8 = 1 more plant.

Mei will spend €9 at the store to fill up her flower bed.",9.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
Mei's flower bed is 143 feet long.
Each plant, including the space between plants, takes up 3 feet (the plant's width) + 13 feet (the space between plants) = 16 feet.
However, for the last plant, there won't be an additional 13 feet of space after it, so we should only consider the plant's width for the last one.
To find out how many plants Mei can fit, we'll divide the total length by the space each plant and its following space take up, but we need to account for the fact that the last plant doesn't require the extra 13 feet.
Let's calculate the maximum number of plants that can fit, considering each plant takes up 16 feet (3 feet for the plant and 13 feet of space), but the last plant will only take up 3 feet.
The total space taken up by plants and their preceding spaces can be calculated as follows: 
If we have n plants, then (n-1) * 13 feet are used for spaces between plants, and n * 3 feet are used for the plants themselves.
So, the equation becomes: 3n + 13(n-1) = 143.
Expanding the equation: 3n + 13n - 13 = 143.
Combining like terms: 16n - 13 = 143.
Adding 13 to both sides: 16n = 156.
Dividing both sides by 16: n = 156 / 16 = 9.75.
Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, Mei can fit 9 plants in her flower bed (because the 10th plant would exceed the length of the flower bed).
Mei already owns 8 flowers, so she needs to buy 9 - 8 = 1 more flower.

Since Mei is buying only 1 more plant, she doesn't qualify for the €5 discount.

Mei has a flower bed that is 143 feet long.
Each plant, including its width, occupies 3 feet (the plant's width) + 13 feet (the space between plants) = 16 feet.
However, for the first plant, there is no preceding space, so it occupies 3 feet (the plant's width) + 13 feet (the space after it, since we're considering the space between plants, not before the first one) = 16 feet, but the last plant will only occupy its width of 3 feet without adding extra space after it. 
To find out how many plants Mei can fit, we calculate the total space occupied by the plants, excluding the last one's extra space: 
Let's denote the number of plants as N. The total length of the flower bed will then be (N-1)*16 + 3 (for the last plant).
We want (N-1)*16 + 3 ≤ 143 (since the bed is 143 feet long).
(N-1)*16 ≤ 140.
N-1 ≤ 140 / 16.
N-1 ≤ 8.75.
Since N must be an integer, N ≤ 9.75, but since it's the number of plants, we consider N = 9 (because we can't have a fraction of a plant, and 10 plants would exceed the space).
Now, we need to calculate how many plants Mei needs to buy. She already owns 8 flowers, and she needs 9 in total.
So, Mei needs to buy 9 - 8 = 1 more plant.
Each plant costs €9, but since Mei buys only 1 more plant, she doesn't get the €5 discount for buying more than 2 plants.
Therefore, Mei will spend 1 * €9 = €9 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

Note that Yara can't work in parallel.,53.0,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the time taken for each step.

### Step 1: Calculate the time taken to peel 60 clams
Yara can peel 6 clams a minute. To peel 60 clams, she will take:
60 clams / 6 clams per minute = 10 minutes

### Step 2: Calculate the time taken to saute 60 clams
Yara can saute 20 clams in 8 minutes. To find out how long it takes her to saute 1 clam, we divide the time by the number of clams:
8 minutes / 20 clams = 0.4 minutes per clam
To saute 60 clams, she will take:
60 clams * 0.4 minutes per clam = 24 minutes

### Step 3: Calculate the total time taken for peeling, sauteing, and washing
- Time to peel 60 clams: 10 minutes
- Time to saute 60 clams: 24 minutes
- Time to wash all the clams: 19 minutes
Since Yara cannot work in parallel, we add these times together:

Then, we multiply this by the total number of clams: 0.4 minutes/clam * 60 clams = 24 minutes.
Now, we add up the time it takes to wash the clams (19 minutes), the time it takes to peel the clams (10 minutes), and the time it takes to saute the clams (24 minutes).

Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet. How much older is Liam's uncle than Liam?,22.0,"## Step 1: Calculate the age at which Liam saw the comet for the second time
Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet. Since Liam's uncle was 31 years old when he first saw the comet, Liam was 2 * 31 = 62 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

## Step 2: Calculate the age at which Liam first saw the comet
Comet Halley orbits the Sun every 53 years. Therefore, Liam saw the comet for the first time 53 years before he saw it for the second time. So, Liam was 62 - 53 = 9 years old when he first saw the comet.

## Step 3: Calculate the age of Liam's uncle when Liam first saw the comet
Liam's uncle was 31 years old when he first saw the comet. Since Liam was 9 years old when he first saw the comet, and the comet appears every 53 years, we need to find out how old Liam's uncle was when Liam was 9 years old. Given that Liam's uncle saw the comet at 31, and the next time it appeared was when Liam was 9, we can calculate the age difference based on the comet's cycle.

## Step 4: Determine the age difference between Liam and his uncle
Since Liam was 9 when he first saw the comet, and his uncle was 31 when he first saw it, and considering the comet's 53-year cycle, we can determine their age difference. When Liam's uncle was 31, Liam was not yet born or was very young. The next time the comet appeared, Liam was 9, which means his uncle was 31 + 53 = 84 years old at that time. However, to find the age difference, we should consider their ages at the same point in the comet's cycle. When Liam was 9, his uncle was 84, but to find the age difference, we subtract their ages at the same cycle point: 84 (uncle's age when Liam was 9) - 9 (Liam's age) = 75. However, this step was incorrectly approached as we should directly calculate the age difference based on their ages at the first sighting and the cycle of the comet.

## Step 5: Correctly calculate the age difference
Liam's uncle was 31 years old when he first saw the comet. The next time the comet appeared, Liam was 9 years old. To find Liam's uncle's age when Liam was 9, we add the comet's cycle to his uncle's age at first sighting: 31 + 53 = 84. The age difference between Liam and his uncle when Liam was 9 is 84 - 9 = 75. However, this calculation incorrectly determines the age difference based on the addition of the comet's cycle to the uncle's age without considering the actual question asked.

## Step 6: Correct the approach to find the age difference
The correct approach should involve understanding that when Liam saw the comet for the second time at the age of 62, his uncle had already seen it twice as well, given the comet's 53-year cycle. Since Liam's uncle was 31 when he first saw the comet, and Liam was 62 when he saw it for the second time, we should calculate the age of Liam's uncle at that point. Liam's uncle would have been 31 + 53 (for the first cycle after he saw it) + 53 (for the second cycle after Liam saw it the first time) = 137 years old when Liam saw the comet for the second time. However, this step misinterprets the calculation needed to find the age difference between Liam and his uncle.

## Step 7: Final calculation of the age difference
To correctly find the age difference, consider that Liam was 62 when he saw the comet for the second time, and this was at an age twice that of his uncle's when his uncle first saw the comet (2 * 31 = 62). Since the comet's cycle is 53 years, and Liam saw it for the second time at 62, we need to find how old his uncle was when Liam was born or when Liam first saw the comet to establish a direct age difference. Given that Liam saw the comet at 9 and then at 62, his uncle saw it at 31 and then would see it again 53 years later. The key is realizing that when Liam was 9 (and saw the comet), his uncle was 31 + 53 = 84. But to find the age difference, we should consider their ages at corresponding points in their lives relative to the comet's appearances.

## Step 8: Correctly determine the age difference based on the comet's cycle and their ages
When Liam's uncle was 31, Liam was not yet 9 (since Liam was 9 at the next comet appearance). The correct way to find the age difference is to consider that Liam was 62 when he saw the comet the second time, which is twice the age his uncle was when his uncle first saw the comet (31). Since Liam was 9 when he first saw the comet, and the comet appears every 53 years, his uncle was 84 when Liam was 9. The age difference between them can be directly calculated by considering their ages at the time of the comet's appearances and the cycle length.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$",75.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
Liam's uncle saw the comet when he was 31 years old.
Since the comet orbits every 53 years, Liam saw the comet for the first time 53 years later, when his uncle was 31 + 53 = 84 years old.
However, we are told that Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet, which is 2 * 31 = 62 years old.
This means that Liam saw the comet for the first time when he was 62 - 53 = 9 years old.
Now, when Liam was 62 years old and saw the comet for the second time, his uncle was 84 + 53 = 137 years old.
So, the age difference between Liam's uncle and Liam is 137 - 62 = 75 years.
The answer is 75.",75.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
Liam's uncle saw the comet when he was 31 years old.
The comet orbits every 53 years, so when Liam saw the comet for the first time, his uncle was 31 + 53 = 84 years old.
When Liam saw the comet for the second time, he was twice the age his uncle was when his uncle first saw the comet, which is 2 * 31 = 62 years old.
Since Liam saw the comet for the second time at the age of 62, and the comet orbits every 53 years, Liam must have seen it for the first time when he was 62 - 53 = 9 years old.
At that time, Liam's uncle was 84 years old.
So, the age difference between Liam's uncle and Liam is 84 - 9 = 75 years.

First, we need to find out how many questions are geography. Since 25% of the 80 questions are geography, we calculate this as 0.25 * 80 = 20 geography questions.

## Step 2: Calculate the number of chemistry questions
Next, we determine the number of chemistry questions, which is 15% of the total. So, 0.15 * 80 = 12 chemistry questions.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of literature and geometry questions
The rest of the questions are equally divided between literature and geometry. Since there are 80 questions in total, and we've already accounted for 20 geography and 12 chemistry questions, that leaves 80 - 20 - 12 = 48 questions. These are equally divided, so there are 48 / 2 = 24 questions for each of literature and geometry.

The total time spent learning per week is the sum of time spent on classes, preparation, and extra learning, which is 1620 + 360 = 1980 minutes.

## Step 9: Convert the total time spent learning per week into hours.
To convert minutes into hours, divide the total minutes by 60. So, 1980 / 60 = 33 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{33}$",33.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
A normal student has 6 periods in a day, but Santiago has to take 3 extra classes.
So, the total number of classes Santiago has in a day is 6 + 3 = 9 classes.
Each class is 30 minutes long, and he spends 15 minutes before each class to review and prepare.
So, the total time spent on each class is 30 + 15 = 45 minutes.
The total time spent in a day is 9 * 45 = 405 minutes.
Since he goes to class for 4 days a week, the total time spent in a week for classes is 405 * 4 = 1620 minutes.
He spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.
So, the extra learning time on each of Saturday and Sunday is (1/9) * 1620 = 180 minutes.
The total extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday is 180 * 2 = 360 minutes.
The total time spent learning in a week is 1620 + 360 = 1980 minutes.
To convert the total time to hours, we divide by 60 since there are 60 minutes in an hour.
So, the total time spent learning in a week is 1980 / 60 = 33 hours.

How much will the supermarket have received after all the balls are sold?",220.0,"## Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the blue balls
First, we need to calculate the total cost of the blue balls. There are 9 blue balls, and each costs ₣12. So, the total cost of the blue balls is 9 * 12 = ₣108.

## Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the purple balls
Next, we calculate the total cost of the purple balls. There are 11 purple balls, and each costs ₣9. So, the total cost of the purple balls is 11 * 9 = ₣99.

## Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the pink balls
Then, we calculate the total cost of the pink balls. There are 17 pink balls, and each costs ₣4. So, the total cost of the pink balls is 17 * 4 = ₣68.

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct,"Olivia walks 20 kilometers every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 kilometers of walking on the beach and 10 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?",75.0,"## Step 1: Determine the original speed relationship between the beach and sidewalk.
Let's denote Olivia's speed on the beach as \(B\) kilometers per hour (km/h) and her speed on the sidewalk as \(S\) km/h. According to the problem, \(S = 4B\), since she walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.

## Step 2: Calculate the new speed after the injury.
After the injury, Olivia's speed decreases by half both on the beach and the sidewalk. Thus, her new speed on the beach is \(B/2\) km/h, and her new speed on the sidewalk is \(S/2 = 4B/2 = 2B\) km/h.

## Step 3: Determine the time spent walking on the beach.
Olivia spends 60 minutes walking on the beach, which is equivalent to 1 hour. The distance she walks on the beach is 10 kilometers. Using the formula \(Speed = Distance/Time\), we can find her new speed on the beach: \(B/2 = 10\, \text{km} / 1\, \text{hour} = 10\) km/h. Therefore, \(B = 20\) km/h.

## Step 4: Calculate the new speed on the sidewalk.
Given \(B = 20\) km/h, the original speed on the sidewalk \(S = 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80\) km/h. After the injury, her new speed on the sidewalk is \(S/2 = 80/2 = 40\) km/h.

## Step 5: Calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk.
The distance walked on the sidewalk is 10 kilometers, and the new speed on the sidewalk is 40 km/h. Using the formula \(Time = Distance/Speed\), we find the time spent walking on the sidewalk: \(Time = 10\, \text{km} / 40\, \text{km/h} = 0.25\) hours, which is equivalent to \(0.25 \times 60 = 15\) minutes.

## Step 6: Calculate the total time for the walk.
The total time for the walk is the sum of the time spent walking on the beach and the time spent walking on the sidewalk: \(60\) minutes (beach) + \(15\) minutes (sidewalk) = \(75\) minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$",75.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
Olivia walks a total of 20 kilometers every day, with 10 kilometers on the beach and 10 kilometers on the sidewalk.
We know that she walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. Let's denote her speed on the beach as S kilometers per hour. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 4S kilometers per hour.
However, due to her injury, her speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. So, her new speed on the beach is S/2 kilometers per hour, and her new speed on the sidewalk is 4S/2 = 2S kilometers per hour.
We are given that 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. We need to find her speed on the beach to calculate the time spent on the sidewalk and the total time for the walk.
First, let's convert 60 minutes to hours since speed is typically measured in kilometers per hour. 60 minutes is 1 hour.
The distance walked on the beach is 10 kilometers, and the time taken is 1 hour. Using the formula Distance = Speed * Time, we can find her new speed on the beach: 10 = (S/2) * 1. Solving for S, we get S/2 = 10, which means S = 20. However, this S is her original speed, and we need her new speed, which is S/2 = 20/2 = 10 kilometers per hour.
Now, we know her new speed on the beach is 10 kilometers per hour, and on the sidewalk, it's 2S = 2*20/2 = 20 kilometers per hour.
The time taken to walk on the beach is given as 60 minutes, which we've used to find her speed.
To find the time taken to walk on the sidewalk, we use the formula Time = Distance / Speed. The distance on the sidewalk is 10 kilometers, and her speed is 20 kilometers per hour. So, Time = 10 / 20 = 0.5 hours. Converting 0.5 hours to minutes gives us 0.5 * 60 = 30 minutes.
The total time for the walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk: 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes.
The answer is 90.",90.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
Olivia walks a total of 20 kilometers every day, with 10 kilometers on the beach and 10 kilometers on the sidewalk.
Her speed on the sidewalk is four times her speed on the beach.
Let's denote her original speed on the beach as x kilometers per hour (km/h).
Then, her original speed on the sidewalk is 4x km/h.
However, due to the injury, her speed decreases by half both on the beach and the sidewalk.
So, her new speed on the beach is x/2 km/h, and her new speed on the sidewalk is 4x/2 = 2x km/h.
We know that 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, which is 10 kilometers.
First, we convert 60 minutes to hours: 60 minutes = 1 hour.
The time spent on the beach can also be calculated as distance/speed = 10 km / (x/2 km/h) = 20/x hours.
Since we know this time is 1 hour, we can set up the equation: 20/x = 1.
Solving for x gives us x = 20 km/h, which is her original speed on the beach.
Her new speed on the beach is x/2 = 20/2 = 10 km/h.
Her new speed on the sidewalk is 2x = 2 * 20 = 40 km/h.
Now, we can calculate the time it takes for her to walk on the sidewalk: time = distance/speed = 10 km / 40 km/h = 0.25 hours.
To convert 0.25 hours into minutes, we multiply by 60: 0.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 15 minutes.
The total time for her walk is the sum of the time on the beach and the time on the sidewalk: 60 minutes + 15 minutes = 75 minutes.

The number of remaining days is 70 - 57 = 13 days.
So, the total number of pancakes he eats in the remaining 13 days is 9 * 13 = 117 pancakes.
The total number of pancakes Arjun eats in 10 weeks is 171 + 117 = 288 pancakes.

Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each place and he gets paid ¥0.45 per collection for each apartment. He also earns 14% on tips. How much money does he make in a week?,1539.0,"To find out how much money Oliver makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from, the total number of collections he makes per week, and then multiply that by his pay per collection per apartment, adding the tips at the end.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes.
The first two apartment complexes have 300 apartments each. So, combined they have:
300 apartments/complex * 2 complexes = 600 apartments

### Step 2: Calculate the number of apartments in the last complex.
The last complex is 50% bigger than the other two combined. Since the first two have 600 apartments combined:
50% of 600 apartments = 0.5 * 600 = 300 apartments
So, the last complex has 600 + 300 = 900 apartments.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of apartments Oliver collects garbage from.
Total apartments = apartments in first two complexes + apartments in the last complex
Total apartments = 600 + 900 = 1500 apartments

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of collections Oliver makes per week.
Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each place. Since there are 3 places:
Total collections per week = 2 collections/week * 3 places = 6 collections/week

However, the question implies he collects from each apartment, not each complex, twice a week. So, the correct understanding should be:
- He collects from each of the 1500 apartments twice a week.

### Step 5: Calculate Oliver's weekly earnings before tips.
Oliver gets paid ¥0.45 per collection for each apartment. With 1500 apartments and collecting twice a week:
Weekly earnings before tips = ¥0.45/collection * 1500 apartments * 2 collections/week
Weekly earnings before tips = ¥0.45 * 3000
Weekly earnings before tips = ¥1350

### Step 6: Calculate Oliver's earnings from tips.
Oliver earns 14% on tips. Assuming this is 14% of his total earnings:
Tips = 14% of ¥1350
Tips = 0.14 * ¥1350
Tips = ¥189

### Step 7: Calculate Oliver's total weekly earnings including tips.
Total weekly earnings = Weekly earnings before tips + Tips
Total weekly earnings = ¥1350 + ¥189
Total weekly earnings = ¥1539

He collects garbage 2 times a week, so he makes 2 collections per week.
He gets paid ¥0.45 per collection for each apartment, so for each collection, he earns 1500 * ¥0.45 = ¥675.
Since he makes 2 collections per week, he earns ¥675 * 2 = ¥1350 per week from the collections.
He also earns 14% on tips, which means he earns ¥1350 * 0.14 = ¥189 from tips.

The maintenance worker originally took 6 minutes to clean a floor, but due to an injury, it now takes them twice as long. So, the new time to clean a floor is 6 * 2 = 12 minutes.

## Step 2: Calculate the total time needed to clean all floors
There are 180 floors, and it takes 12 minutes to clean each floor. The total time needed to clean all floors is 180 * 12 = 2160 minutes.

## Step 3: Convert the total time from minutes to hours
To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. So, 2160 minutes / 60 = 36 hours.

## Step 4: Calculate the total hours available to work in 10 days
The maintenance worker works 6 hours a day for 10 days. The total hours available is 6 * 10 = 60 hours.

## Step 5: Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning floors on average
The total time needed to clean all floors is 36 hours, and the worker has 60 hours available. To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning, we first find the average hours spent cleaning per day: 36 hours / 10 days = 3.6 hours per day. Then, we calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning: (3.6 hours / 6 hours) * 100.

## Step 6: Perform the final calculation for the percentage
(3.6 / 6) * 100 = 60%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$",60.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
The maintenance worker has to clean 180 floors.
It originally took them 6 minutes per floor, but due to the injury, it now takes twice as long, which is 6 * 2 = 12 minutes per floor.
The total time needed to clean all floors is 180 floors * 12 minutes per floor = 2160 minutes.
Since they have 10 days to get it done, we need to calculate how many minutes they work per day.
They work 6 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, so they work 6 * 60 = 360 minutes per day.
The total time spent cleaning floors over 10 days is 2160 minutes.
The total time available for work over 10 days is 10 days * 360 minutes per day = 3600 minutes.
The time spent cleaning floors per day, on average, is 2160 minutes / 10 days = 216 minutes per day.
To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning floors, we divide the average daily cleaning time by the total daily work time and multiply by 100: (216 minutes / 360 minutes) * 100 = 60%.

1. Gabriel started with 78 beads.
2. He dropped one-third of them. One-third of 78 is 78 / 3 = 26 beads.
3. So, after dropping 26 beads, he had 78 - 26 = 52 beads left.
4. He found 17 of the beads he dropped, so now he has 52 + 17 = 69 beads.
5. However, 9 of the beads he picked up weren't actually beads, so he got rid of them. Now he has 69 - 9 = 60 beads.
6. His father gave him a pouch with 7 beads, so now Gabriel has 60 + 7 = 67 beads.

Therefore, Gabriel ended up with 67 beads.",67.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
Gabriel starts with 78 beads.
He drops one-third of them, which is 78 / 3 = 26 beads.
So, after dropping some beads, he has 78 - 26 = 52 beads.
He then picks up 17 beads that he dropped.
Now, he has 52 + 17 = 69 beads.
However, 9 of the beads he picked up weren't actually beads, so he gets rid of them.
This leaves him with 69 - 9 = 60 beads.
Gabriel's father then gives him a pouch with 7 beads.
So, Gabriel ends up with 60 + 7 = 67 beads.

After Alejandro takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. Alejandro gives 1/5 of the made popcorns to his brother Tariq. How many pieces of popcorn does Alejandro have to eat?",756.0,"## Step 1: Calculate the number of kernels that popped in the first 22 seconds.
90 kernels popped in the first 22 seconds.

## Step 2: Calculate the number of kernels that popped in the next 22 seconds.
In the next 22 seconds, 3 times the amount of the first 22 seconds popped, which is 3 * 90 = 270 kernels.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of kernels that popped in the next 22 seconds after that.
The kernels increased to 4 times the initial popping rate, so 4 * 90 = 360 kernels popped in this period.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds of cooking.
The popping slowed down to half the rate of the past 22 seconds, which means half of 360, so 360 / 2 = 180 kernels.

## Step 5: Calculate the number of kernels that popped from the residual heat after the pot was taken off the heat.
A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds also popped from the residual heat, which is 1/4 * 180 = 45 kernels.

## Step 6: Calculate the total number of kernels that popped.
Add up all the kernels that popped: 90 + 270 + 360 + 180 + 45 = 945 kernels.

## Step 7: Calculate the number of kernels Alejandro gives to his brother Tariq.
Alejandro gives 1/5 of the made popcorn to his brother, which is 1/5 * 945 = 189 kernels.

## Step 8: Calculate the number of kernels Alejandro has to eat.
Subtract the number of kernels given to Tariq from the total: 945 - 189 = 756 kernels.

In the final 22 seconds of cooking, the popping rate is half of the previous rate, which was 360 kernels in 22 seconds. So, the rate is (1/2) * 360 = 180 kernels in the final 22 seconds of cooking.
After the pot is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds also pop from the residual heat, so (1/4) * 180 = 45 kernels pop.

1. **Determine the number of green cubes**: We are given that there are 4 green cubes.

2. **Determine the number of black cubes**: We are told there are five times as many black cubes as green cubes. So, the number of black cubes = 5 * number of green cubes = 5 * 4 = 20.

3. **Calculate the total number of green and black cubes**: Total green and black cubes = number of green cubes + number of black cubes = 4 + 20 = 24.

4. **Find the number of white cubes**: Total cubes = 40, so the number of white cubes = Total cubes - Total green and black cubes = 40 - 24 = 16.

5. **Calculate the percentage of white cubes**: Percentage of white cubes = (number of white cubes / Total cubes) * 100 = (16 / 40) * 100 = 0.4 * 100 = 40%.
