gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct,"Sophia went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, and 60 mini cheesecakes. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,"## Step 1: Calculate the cost of donuts
First, we need to calculate the cost of the donuts. Sophia bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen. Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, we divide 60 by 12 to get the number of dozens, which is 5. Then, we multiply the number of dozens by the cost per dozen: 5 * $19 = $95.

## Step 2: Calculate the cost of mini cupcakes
Next, we calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen. Again, we divide 60 by 12 to get the number of dozens, which is 5. Then, we multiply the number of dozens by the cost per dozen: 5 * $33 = $165.

## Step 3: Calculate the total cost of donuts and mini cupcakes before discount
Now, we add the cost of donuts and mini cupcakes to get the total cost before discount: $95 + $165 = $260.

## Step 4: Calculate the total cost after discount
Sophia paid a total of $1500 after a 20% discount. Let's denote the total cost before the discount as X. The formula for the discount is X - 0.20X = $1500. Simplifying this, we get 0.80X = $1500.

## Step 5: Solve for the total cost before discount
To find the total cost before the discount, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.80: X = $1500 / 0.80 = $1875.

## Step 6: Calculate the cost of mini cheesecakes before discount
Now, we subtract the cost of donuts and mini cupcakes from the total cost before discount to find the cost of mini cheesecakes: $1875 - $260 = $1615.

## Step 7: Calculate the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen
Since Sophia bought 60 mini cheesecakes, we divide 60 by 12 to get the number of dozens, which is 5. Then, we divide the total cost of mini cheesecakes by the number of dozens to get the cost per dozen: $1615 / 5 = $323.

The final answer is: $\boxed{323}$",323.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
First, we need to calculate the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes before the discount.
The cost of 60 donuts can be calculated by first finding the cost of one dozen donuts, which is $19, and then determining how many dozens are in 60 donuts. Since 1 dozen = 12 donuts, 60 donuts = 60 / 12 = 5 dozen donuts. So, the cost of 60 donuts is 5 * $19 = $95.
The cost of 60 mini cupcakes can be calculated similarly. Since 1 dozen = 12 mini cupcakes, 60 mini cupcakes = 60 / 12 = 5 dozen mini cupcakes. So, the cost of 60 mini cupcakes is 5 * $33 = $165.
The total cost of donuts and mini cupcakes before the discount is $95 + $165 = $260.
Since Sophia paid a total of $1500 after a 20% discount, we can calculate the total cost before the discount. Let x be the total cost before the discount. After a 20% discount, the amount paid is 80% of the original cost, which can be expressed as 0.8x = $1500.
To find x, we divide both sides by 0.8: x = $1500 / 0.8 = $1875.
This means the total cost before the discount was $1875.
The cost of the mini cheesecakes can be found by subtracting the cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes from the total cost before the discount: $1875 - $260 = $1615.
Since Sophia bought 60 mini cheesecakes, and we want to find the cost per dozen, we first determine how many dozens of mini cheesecakes she bought. 60 mini cheesecakes = 60 / 12 = 5 dozen mini cheesecakes.
The cost per dozen mini cheesecakes is $1615 / 5 = $323.
The answer is $323.",323.0,1,,323.0,1
gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving. A 300 grams bag has 6 servings. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?",350.0,"## Step 1: Calculate Hiroshi's daily calorie target
To find Hiroshi's daily calorie target, we need to multiply his weight in pounds by the healthy daily calorie target per pound. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and the target is 15 calories per pound. So, Hiroshi's daily calorie target = 220 lbs * 15 calories/lb = 3300 calories.

## Step 2: Calculate Tara's daily calorie target
Similarly, to find Tara's daily calorie target, we multiply her weight by the daily calorie target per pound. Tara weighs 140 lbs. So, Tara's daily calorie target = 140 lbs * 15 calories/lb = 2100 calories.

## Step 3: Calculate Hiroshi's remaining daily calorie allowance
Hiroshi has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. So, his net calorie consumption is 1100 - 200 = 900 calories. To find his remaining daily calorie allowance, we subtract this from his daily target: 3300 - 900 = 2400 calories.

## Step 4: Calculate Tara's remaining daily calorie allowance
Tara has consumed 900 calories in food and 200 calories in ice cream, totaling 1100 calories. To find her remaining daily calorie allowance, we subtract this total from her daily target: 2100 - 1100 = 1000 calories.

## Step 5: Determine how many calories of popcorn Hiroshi can consume
Given that Hiroshi has 2400 calories left in his daily allowance, and knowing the calorie content per serving of popcorn (200 calories), we can calculate how many servings of popcorn he can have: 2400 / 200 = 12 servings.

## Step 6: Determine how many calories of popcorn Tara can consume
Given that Tara has 1000 calories left in her daily allowance, we calculate how many servings of popcorn she can have: 1000 / 200 = 5 servings.

## Step 7: Calculate the total grams of popcorn Hiroshi can consume
Since a 300 grams bag has 6 servings, we first find out how many grams are in one serving: 300 grams / 6 servings = 50 grams per serving. Then, for Hiroshi, 12 servings * 50 grams/serving = 600 grams.

## Step 8: Calculate the total grams of popcorn Tara can consume
For Tara, 5 servings * 50 grams/serving = 250 grams.

## Step 9: Find the difference in grams of popcorn Hiroshi and Tara can consume
To find how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara, we subtract Tara's amount from Hiroshi's: 600 grams - 250 grams = 350 grams.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$",350.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Hiroshi and Tara.
Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and his daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight.
So, Hiroshi's daily calorie target is 220 * 15 = 3300 calories.

Tara weighs 140 lbs, and her daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight.
So, Tara's daily calorie target is 140 * 15 = 2100 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many calories Hiroshi and Tara have already consumed and burned.
Hiroshi has consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise.
So, the net calories Hiroshi has consumed is 1100 - 200 = 900 calories.

Tara has consumed 900 calories in food and 200 calories in ice cream.
So, the total calories Tara has consumed is 900 + 200 = 1100 calories.

Now, we need to calculate how many calories Hiroshi and Tara can still consume.
Hiroshi's daily calorie target is 3300 calories, and he has already consumed 900 calories.
So, Hiroshi can still consume 3300 - 900 = 2400 calories.

Tara's daily calorie target is 2100 calories, and she has already consumed 1100 calories.
So, Tara can still consume 2100 - 1100 = 1000 calories.

Since a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving, and a 300 grams bag has 6 servings, we can calculate the calories per gram of popcorn.
A 300 grams bag has 6 servings, and each serving has 200 calories.
So, the total calories in a 300 grams bag is 6 * 200 = 1200 calories.
The calories per gram of popcorn is 1200 / 300 = 4 calories per gram.

Now, we can calculate how many grams of popcorn Hiroshi and Tara can still consume.
Hiroshi can still consume 2400 calories, and each gram of popcorn has 4 calories.
So, Hiroshi can still consume 2400 / 4 = 600 grams of popcorn.

Tara can still consume 1000 calories, and each gram of popcorn has 4 calories.
So, Tara can still consume 1000 / 4 = 250 grams of popcorn.

Finally, we can calculate how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara.
Hiroshi can still consume 600 grams of popcorn, and Tara can still consume 250 grams of popcorn.
So, Hiroshi needs to consume 600 - 250 = 350 grams more than Tara.

Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Daphne remain with?",335.0,"To find out how many potted plants Daphne will remain with, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of plants Daphne already has on her window ledges.
2. Add the 23 new plants she received two days ago.
3. Add the 200 new plants she purchased yesterday.
4. Calculate the total number of plants she will give away tomorrow.
5. Subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of plants Daphne already has on her window ledges.
She has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges.
Total plants on ledges = 8 plants/ledge * 56 ledges = 448 plants

Step 2: Add the 23 new plants she received two days ago.
Total plants now = 448 plants + 23 plants = 471 plants

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct,"A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 60 minutes to cover every 4 miles of the city. However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,"To solve this, we first need to understand the rate at which the fog bank covers the city and how the wind speed affects this rate.

1. Initially, the fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes. This means its initial speed is 4 miles / 60 minutes = 1/15 miles per minute.

2. The city is 80 miles across, and we want to find out how long it takes to cover 1/4 of the city. 1/4 of 80 miles is 20 miles.

3. The wind speed is halved in one hour (60 minutes), which affects the fog bank's speed. However, for the first 60 minutes, the fog bank moves at its initial speed.

4. Since the fog bank's speed is 1/15 miles per minute for the first 60 minutes, in this hour, it covers 1/15 miles/minute * 60 minutes = 4 miles.

5. After the first 60 minutes, the wind speed is halved, which means the fog bank's speed is also halved. So, its new speed is (1/15 miles/minute) / 2 = 1/30 miles/minute.

6. The fog bank needs to cover 20 miles in total to cover 1/4 of the city and has already covered 4 miles in the first 60 minutes. So, it has 20 miles - 4 miles = 16 miles left to cover at the reduced speed.

7. To cover 16 miles at 1/30 miles/minute, it will take 16 miles / (1/30 miles/minute) = 16 * 30 = 480 minutes.

8. However, we've already accounted for the first 60 minutes in our calculation. So, the total time to cover 1/4 of the city is the initial 60 minutes plus the additional time calculated at the reduced speed.

But let's reassess the calculation considering the initial conditions and the change in wind speed correctly:

- In the first 60 minutes, the fog covers 4 miles.
- The remaining distance to cover 1/4 of the city (20 miles) after the first 60 minutes is 20 - 4 = 16 miles.
- The speed after the first hour is halved, so it becomes 1/15 / 2 = 1/30 miles per minute.

To cover 16 miles at this reduced speed:
16 miles / (1/30 miles/minute) = 16 * 30 = 480 minutes.

However, this is the time to cover the remaining 16 miles after the first 60 minutes. So, the total time to cover 20 miles (1/4 of the city) would be the initial 60 minutes plus the time to cover the remaining 16 miles at the reduced speed.

The correct approach to calculate the time for the remaining distance after the wind speed is halved should consider the proportion of the distance covered in the first hour and the subsequent hours at the reduced speed. 

Given that the fog bank covers 4 miles in the first 60 minutes, and then its speed is halved, we should directly calculate how long it takes to cover the remaining distance without miscalculating the speed's impact.

For 1/4 of the city (20 miles), and knowing the fog bank covers 4 miles in the first 60 minutes:
- Remaining distance to cover = 20 miles - 4 miles = 16 miles.
- At the reduced speed of 1/30 miles/minute, the time to cover 16 miles is 16 / (1/30) = 16 * 30 = 480 minutes.

The total time is the initial 60 minutes plus the 480 minutes to cover the remaining distance at the reduced speed:
60 minutes + 480 minutes = 540 minutes.

This calculation approach, however, does not accurately reflect the gradual change in speed due to the wind halving. A more precise calculation involves understanding that the speed reduction affects the time it takes to cover the remaining distance after the first hour, but the initial calculation provided a straightforward, albeit not fully nuanced, path to estimating the total time required.

Let's correct the calculation with the proper approach considering the speed and distance:

The fog bank initially covers 4 miles in 60 minutes. Then, its speed is halved. We need it to cover 20 miles (1/4 of the city).

In the first 60 minutes, it covers 4 miles at 1/15 miles/minute. For the remaining 16 miles, considering the speed is halved to 1/30 miles/minute after the first hour, we calculate the time to cover this remaining distance at the new speed.

The time to cover 16 miles at 1/30 miles/minute is indeed 16 * 30 = 480 minutes. But this is after the first 60 minutes. So, the correct total time to cover 20 miles, considering the speed change, would indeed be the sum of the initial 60 minutes and the time to cover the remaining distance at the reduced speed.

However, the critical insight here involves recognizing that the question essentially asks for the time to cover a portion of the city under changing conditions. Given the information and the need for a step-by-step logical progression, let's refine the approach:

1. The fog bank covers 4 miles in the first 60 minutes.
2. It needs to cover 20 miles in total for 1/4 of the city.
3. After the first 60 minutes, the speed is halved.

Given the speed is 1/15 miles/minute initially and it covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, after the speed is halved, it becomes 1/30 miles/minute.

To cover 20 miles with the initial speed of 1/15 miles/minute for the first 60 minutes and then at 1/30 miles/minute, we should consider the distance covered in the first hour and the subsequent time at the reduced speed.

The correct calculation should consider the time it takes to cover the remaining distance after the first hour at the reduced speed, adding that to the initial 60 minutes.

To cover 16 miles at 1/30 miles/minute:
16 miles / (1/30 miles/minute) = 16 * 30 = 480 minutes.

Adding this to the initial 60 minutes gives us the total time for 1/4 of the city:
60 minutes + 480 minutes = 540 minutes.

This detailed step-by-step approach ensures we account for the change in speed and calculate the total time accurately based on the given conditions.

The final answer is 540 minutes.",540.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
The city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge.
We need to find out how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city.
1/4 of the city is 80 * 1/4 = 20 miles.
It takes 60 minutes to cover every 4 miles of the city.
So, the speed of the fog bank is 4 miles / 60 minutes = 1/15 miles per minute.
To cover 20 miles, it would take 20 / (1/15) = 20 * 15 = 300 minutes at the initial speed.
However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour, which means the fog bank's speed will also be halved.
Since the speed is halved, it will take twice as long to cover the same distance in the second hour.
But we are only interested in the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, which is 20 miles.
Since the speed is halved after 1 hour, we need to calculate how much distance the fog bank covers in the first hour.
In the first hour (60 minutes), the fog bank covers 4 miles / 60 minutes * 60 minutes = 4 miles.
So, after the first hour, 16 miles are left to cover 1/4 of the city (20 miles - 4 miles = 16 miles).
At the halved speed, it takes twice as long to cover the same distance, so it takes 60 minutes * 2 = 120 minutes to cover 4 miles at the halved speed.
To cover 16 miles at the halved speed, it takes 16 / 4 * 120 minutes = 480 minutes.
However, this is the time it takes to cover 16 miles at the halved speed, and we already waited 60 minutes for the first 4 miles.
So, the total time to cover 20 miles is 60 minutes + 16 / 4 * 60 minutes = 60 minutes + 240 minutes = 300 minutes, but this calculation does not take into account the fact that the speed is halved after 1 hour.
Let's redo the calculation considering the speed reduction.
In the first hour, the fog bank covers 4 miles.
In the next hour, the speed is halved, so the fog bank covers 2 miles (half of 4 miles).
We need to cover 20 miles, and we already covered 4 miles in the first hour and 2 miles in the second hour (at the reduced speed), for a total of 6 miles.
We still need to cover 20 - 6 = 14 miles.
Since the speed is now constant at 2 miles per hour (or 1/30 miles per minute), it will take 14 / 2 * 60 minutes = 420 minutes to cover the remaining 14 miles at the reduced speed.
However, we already waited 120 minutes (60 minutes for the first 4 miles and 60 minutes for the next 2 miles).
So, the total time to cover 20 miles is 120 minutes + 420 minutes = 540 minutes, but this is not correct because we are counting the time for the reduced speed for the entire remaining distance.
Let's redo the calculation again.
The fog bank covers 4 miles in the first 60 minutes.
Then, the speed is halved, and the fog bank covers 2 miles in the next 60 minutes.
Now, we have covered 6 miles, and we need to cover 20 - 6 = 14 miles at the reduced speed of 2 miles per hour.
It will take 14 / 2 = 7 hours to cover the remaining 14 miles at the reduced speed.
Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 7 hours is 7 * 60 minutes = 420 minutes.
However, we already waited 120 minutes, so we need to add the time it takes to cover the remaining 14 miles at the reduced speed to the initial 120 minutes.
But we should not add the entire 420 minutes because the reduced speed only applies after the first 2 hours (120 minutes).
Let's think about it in a different way.
The fog bank needs to cover 20 miles.
In the first hour, it covers 4 miles.
In the second hour, the speed is halved, but we are only interested in the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, which is 20 miles.
Since the speed is 4 miles per hour initially, and it is halved after 1 hour, we can calculate the time it takes to cover 20 miles by using the initial speed for the first hour and the reduced speed for the remaining time.
In the first hour, the fog bank covers 4 miles.
We still need to cover 20 - 4 = 16 miles.
The speed is now halved to 2 miles per hour.
To cover the remaining 16 miles at 2 miles per hour, it will take 16 / 2 = 8 hours.
Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 8 hours is 8 * 60 minutes = 480 minutes.
But we already waited 60 minutes for the first 4 miles.
So, the total time is 60 minutes + 480 minutes = 540 minutes, but this is the time it takes to cover the remaining 16 miles at the reduced speed plus the initial 60 minutes.
However, we should not use the reduced speed for the entire remaining distance because the problem asks for the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, which is 20 miles.
Let's think about it in a different way.
The fog bank covers 4 miles in the first 60 minutes.
Then, the speed is halved, and the fog bank covers 2 miles in the next 60 minutes.
Now, we have covered 6 miles, and we need to cover 20 - 6 = 14 miles.
But we are only interested in the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, which is 20 miles.
Since we already covered 6 miles in 120 minutes, we can calculate the remaining time.
We still need to cover 20 - 6 = 14 miles.
At the reduced speed of 2 miles per hour, it will take 14 / 2 = 7 hours to cover the remaining 14 miles.
Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 7 hours is 7 * 60 minutes = 420 minutes.
But we already waited 120 minutes, so we need to add the time it takes to cover the remaining 14 miles at the reduced speed to the initial 120 minutes.

We still need to cover 20 - 6 = 14 miles.
At the reduced speed of 2 miles per hour, it will take 14 / 2 = 7 hours to cover the remaining 14 miles.

But we are only interested in the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, which is 20 miles.
Since we already waited 120 minutes, we can calculate the remaining time.
To cover 20 miles, it takes 20 / 4 * 60 minutes = 300 minutes at the initial speed.
However, the speed is halved after 1 hour, so we need to calculate the time it takes to cover the remaining distance at the reduced speed.
We already covered 6 miles in 120 minutes.
We still need to cover 20 - 6 = 14 miles.

Then, the speed is halved, and the fog bank covers 2 miles in the next 60 minutes.
Now, we have covered 6 miles, and we need to cover 20 - 6 = 14 miles.
At the reduced speed of 2 miles per hour, it will take 14 / 2 = 7 hours to cover the remaining 14 miles.
Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 7 hours is 7 * 60 minutes = 420 minutes.
But we are only interested in the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, which is 20 miles.
Since we already waited 120 minutes, we can calculate the remaining time.
The correct way to think about it is that the fog bank covers 4 miles in the first 60 minutes.
Then, the speed is halved, and the fog bank covers 2 miles in the next 60 minutes.
Now, we have covered 6 miles, and we need to cover 20 - 6 = 14 miles.
At the reduced speed of 2 miles per hour, it will take 14 / 2 = 7 hours to cover the remaining 14 miles.
Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 7 hours is 7 * 60 minutes = 420 minutes.
But we already waited 120 minutes, so we need to add the time it takes to cover the remaining 14 miles at the reduced speed to the initial 120 minutes.
However, we should not add the entire 420 minutes because the reduced speed only applies after the first 2 hours (120 minutes).
The answer is 150.",150.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes.
First, we need to find out how many miles are in 1/4 of the city. Since the city is 80 miles across, 1/4 of the city is 80 / 4 = 20 miles.
The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, so to cover 20 miles, it would take (20 / 4) * 60 = 5 * 60 = 300 minutes if the wind speed remained constant.
However, we are told the wind speed is halved in one hour, which means the fog bank's speed is also halved after 60 minutes. 
In the first 60 minutes, the fog bank covers 4 miles.
In the next 60 minutes, due to the halved speed, it will cover 2 miles (half of 4 miles).
So, in the first 120 minutes, the fog bank covers 4 + 2 = 6 miles.
We still need to cover 20 - 6 = 14 miles.
Since the speed is halved, it now covers 1 mile in 60 minutes (because it originally covered 4 miles in 60 minutes, and now it covers 2 miles in 60 minutes after the speed reduction, but we are calculating for the period after the reduction).
To cover the remaining 14 miles at this reduced speed, it will take 14 * 60 = 840 minutes.
However, this calculation doesn't account for the fact that we're only considering the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, and the speed reduction's impact on the overall time.
Let's correct the approach considering the speed reduction:
- The fog bank covers 4 miles in the first 60 minutes.
- After the wind speed is halved, the fog bank's speed is also halved, meaning it covers half the distance in the same time, so 2 miles in the next 60 minutes.
Since we need to find out how long it takes to cover 20 miles (1/4 of the city), and knowing the fog bank covers 4 miles in the first 60 minutes and then 2 miles in each subsequent 60 minutes due to the halved speed:
- In the first 60 minutes, it covers 4 miles.
- It needs to cover 20 - 4 = 16 miles more.
- At the reduced speed of 2 miles per 60 minutes, it will take (16 / 2) * 60 = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes to cover the remaining 16 miles after the first 60 minutes.
- Adding the initial 60 minutes to this gives a total of 60 + 480 = 540 minutes.

On Thursday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. On Friday, he finished homework early and watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 2-hour episodes. On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?",6.0,"To solve this problem, let's break down the information and calculate the total hours of TV watched each day, excluding Thursday.

- On Tuesday and Wednesday, Santiago watched 4-hour episodes each night. So, that's 4 hours * 2 nights = 8 hours.
- On Friday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. The 45-minute show is 0.75 hours. So, that's 3 hours + 0.75 hours = 3.75 hours.
- On Saturday, he watched three 2-hour episodes. So, that's 2 hours * 3 episodes = 6 hours.
- On Sunday, he watched three 15-minute episodes. Each 15-minute episode is 0.25 hours. So, that's 0.25 hours * 3 episodes = 0.75 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours from Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:
8 hours + 3.75 hours + 6 hours + 0.75 hours = 18.5 hours.

Since Santiago watched a total of 20 hours of TV, the hours watched on Thursday can be found by subtracting the total hours watched on the other days from the total:
20 hours - 18.5 hours = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Thursday is 15 minutes (or 0.25 hours), we divide the total hours watched on Thursday by the length of each episode:
1.5 hours / 0.25 hours per episode = 6 episodes.

So, Santiago watched 6 episodes of the 15-minute show on Thursday.",15.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, Santiago watched 4-hour episodes, so that's 4 hours * 2 nights = 8 hours.
On Friday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. We need to convert 45 minutes to hours, which is 45 / 60 = 0.75 hours. So, on Friday, he watched 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.
On Saturday, he watched three 2-hour episodes, which is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.
Now, let's add up the hours we know: 8 hours (Tuesday and Wednesday) + 3.75 hours (Friday) + 6 hours (Saturday) = 17.75 hours.
We are told he watched a total of 20 hours of TV. So, the hours left for Thursday and Sunday are 20 - 17.75 = 2.25 hours.
On Sunday, he watched three 15-minute episodes. We need to convert 15 minutes to hours, which is 15 / 60 = 0.25 hours. So, three episodes are 3 * 0.25 = 0.75 hours.
Now, let's subtract the hours watched on Sunday from the hours left for Thursday and Sunday: 2.25 - 0.75 = 1.5 hours.
Since each episode on Thursday is 15 minutes, or 0.25 hours, we divide the total hours watched on Thursday by the length of each episode: 1.5 / 0.25 = 6.

She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, and uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,"## Step 1: Determine the ratio of sugar to water
The given ratio of sugar to water is 54:27, which can be simplified by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor, 9. This simplifies to 6:3.

## Step 2: Express the ratio in terms of a variable
Let's denote the multiplier for the ratio as x. Therefore, the amount of sugar used is 6x teaspoons, and the amount of water used is 3x cups.

## Step 3: Calculate the amount of milk used
Nia uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water. Since she used 3x cups of water, the amount of milk used is (8/8)*3x = 3x tablespoons of milk.

## Step 4: Calculate the amount of heavy cream used
She uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. Since she used 6x teaspoons of sugar, the amount of heavy cream used is 2*6x = 12x tablespoons of heavy cream.

## Step 5: Set up the equation based on the total amount used
The total amount of sugar, water, cream, and milk used is given as 240. Since water is measured in cups and the rest are in teaspoons or tablespoons, and given that 1 cup is approximately equal to 48 teaspoons (but for the purpose of this problem, we keep the units as given), we need to convert everything into a common unit or understand that the units are already accounted for in the ratio. However, the problem does not require conversion between cups and teaspoons/tablespoons for the solution, as the ratios and total are given in a way that allows us to work directly with the provided units. Therefore, the equation based on the given information is 6x (sugar) + 3x (water) + 12x (cream) + 3x (milk) = 240.

## Step 6: Solve the equation for x
Combining like terms, we get 6x + 3x + 12x + 3x = 240, which simplifies to 24x = 240. Dividing both sides by 24 gives x = 10.

## Step 7: Calculate the amount of sugar used
Since the amount of sugar used is 6x, substituting x = 10 gives 6*10 = 60 teaspoons of sugar.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$",60.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
Nia uses teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 54:27, which simplifies to 2:1.
This means for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 1 cup of water.
She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, which simplifies to 1 tablespoon of milk for every 1 cup of water.
Additionally, she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every 1 teaspoon of sugar.
Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as S. Then, the number of cups of water is S/2, the number of tablespoons of milk is S/2 (since it's 1:1 with the water), and the number of tablespoons of heavy cream is 2S.
We know that the total amount of ingredients (teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk) is 240.
So, we can write the equation: S + S/2 + 2S + S/2 = 240.
Combining like terms, we get S + S/2 + S/2 + 2S = 240, which simplifies to 4S = 240 (since S + S/2 + S/2 = 2S and then 2S + 2S = 4S).
Dividing both sides by 4, we get S = 240 / 4 = 60.

The guests brought 2 packs of forks, each with 6 forks, so they brought 2 * 6 = 12 forks.

## Step 3: Determine the total number of forks Aisha's husband bought.
Aisha's husband bought a package of 8 forks.

## Step 4: Calculate the total number of forks Aisha used and threw away.
Aisha used 16 forks to sample her stuffed peppers and threw away 6 defective forks, so in total, she used or threw away 16 + 6 = 22 forks.

## Step 5: Calculate the total number of forks Aisha and her husband had before the guests arrived and before Aisha used or threw away any forks.
Let x be the number of forks in the package Aisha bought. Then, the total number of forks Aisha and her husband had initially is x + 8 (from her husband's purchase).

After the guests brought their forks, the total number of forks is x + 8 + 12 = x + 20.

## Step 7: Account for the forks Aisha used or threw away.
Since Aisha used or threw away 22 forks, the equation representing the situation after she used or threw away the forks but before setting the table is x + 20 - 22 = 32.

In the span of two years, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?",1764.0,"## Step 1: Calculate the number of bananas per square yard
First, we need to find out how many bananas Ravi can harvest per square yard. We are given that there are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard. So, to find the number of bananas per square yard, we need to divide 36 by four-fifths (or 0.8). bananas_per_square_yard = 36 / 0.8 = 45.

## Step 2: Calculate the total number of bananas Ravi can harvest from his banana field
Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field. Using the bananas per square yard calculated in step 1, we can find the total number of bananas he can harvest from his banana field. total_bananas = bananas_per_square_yard * 10 = 45 * 10 = 450.

## Step 3: Calculate how many times Ravi can harvest bananas in two years
Since Ravi can harvest his bananas every 4 months, we need to calculate how many times he can do this in two years. There are 12 months in a year, so in two years, there are 24 months. harvest_times = 24 / 4 = 6.

## Step 4: Calculate the total number of bananas Ravi can harvest in two years
Now, we multiply the total number of bananas Ravi can harvest at one time by the number of times he can harvest in two years. total_bananas_two_years = total_bananas * harvest_times = 450 * 6 = 2700.

## Step 5: Calculate the total number of apricots Ravi can harvest from his apricot field at one time
Ravi owns a 13-square yard apricot field that produces 12 apricots per square yard. total_apricots = 13 * 12 = 156.

## Step 7: Calculate the difference between the total number of bananas and apricots Ravi can harvest in two years
Finally, to find out how many more bananas Ravi harvests than apricots in two years, we subtract the total number of apricots from the total number of bananas. difference = total_bananas_two_years - total_apricots_two_years = 2700 - 936 = 1764.

Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field, so the total number of bananas per harvest is 10 * 45 = 450 bananas.
Since Ravi can harvest his bananas every 4 months, in 2 years (24 months), he can harvest 24 / 4 = 6 times.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row, than that he rolls four even numbers in a row?",50.0,"## Step 1: Determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a twenty-sided die.
The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a twenty-sided die is calculated by counting the favorable outcomes (numbers greater than 5) and dividing by the total possible outcomes. There are 15 numbers greater than 5 (6 to 20) out of 20 possible outcomes. So, the probability is 15/20, which simplifies to 3/4.

## Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row.
To find the probability of an event happening twice in a row, we square the probability of the event happening once. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is (3/4)^2 = 9/16.

## Step 3: Determine the probability of rolling an even number on a twenty-sided die.
There are 10 even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20) out of 20 possible outcomes. So, the probability of rolling an even number is 10/20, which simplifies to 1/2.

## Step 4: Calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row.
Similar to step 2, to find the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row, we raise the probability of rolling an even number to the power of 4. Therefore, the probability is (1/2)^4 = 1/16.

## Step 5: Convert the probabilities to percentages for comparison.
The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is 9/16, which as a percentage is (9/16) * 100 = 56.25%. The probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is 1/16, which as a percentage is (1/16) * 100 = 6.25%.

## Step 6: Calculate the difference in percentage points between the two probabilities.
To find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 5 twice in a row than to roll four even numbers in a row, we subtract the percentage of rolling four even numbers from the percentage of rolling a number greater than 5 twice. So, 56.25% - 6.25% = 50%.

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a single roll is 15/20 = 3/4 = 0.75, or 75%.
The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 = 0.5625, or 56.25%.
Next, we calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row. There are 10 even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20) out of 20 possible outcomes.
So, the probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5, or 50%.
The probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16 = 0.0625, or 6.25%.
To find the difference in percentage points between these two probabilities, we subtract the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row: 56.25% - 6.25% = 50%.

1. **Determine the number of beetles**: Since there are 2/3 as many beetles as bees, and there are 9 bees, we calculate the number of beetles as follows:
   - Number of beetles = 2/3 * Number of bees
   - Number of beetles = 2/3 * 9

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct,"Mrs. Lee is looking for a new townhouse that will not go beyond her $340000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $400000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?",11000.0,"## Step 1: Calculate the discount on the selling price
First, we need to calculate the discount on the selling price. The selling price is $400000, and Mrs. Lee can get a 25% discount. So, the discount amount is 25% of $400000, which is 0.25 * $400000 = $100000.

## Step 2: Calculate the discounted selling price
Now, we subtract the discount from the original selling price to get the discounted selling price. Discounted selling price = $400000 - $100000 = $300000.

## Step 3: Calculate the brokerage fee
The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. Since the selling price after discount is $300000, the brokerage fee is 0.05 * $300000 = $15000.

## Step 4: Calculate the transfer fee
The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price. So, the transfer fee is 0.12 * $300000 = $36000.

## Step 5: Calculate the total cost
The total cost includes the discounted selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee. Total cost = $300000 + $15000 + $36000 = $300000 + $51000 = $351000.

## Step 6: Calculate how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Lee's budget
To find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Lee's budget, we subtract her budget from the total cost. Difference = $351000 - $340000 = $11000.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11000}$",11000.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
The selling price of the property is $400000.
Mrs. Lee can get a 25% discount on the selling price.
So, the discount amount is 25% of $400000, which is 0.25 * $400000 = $100000.
The discounted price is $400000 - $100000 = $300000.
On top of the discounted price, there is a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $400000 = $20000.
There is also a transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $400000 = $48000.
So, the total cost is the discounted price + brokerage fee + transfer fee, which is $300000 + $20000 + $48000 = $358000.
Mrs. Lee's budget is $340000.

The stocks gained 10% each year for two years. How much were Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years?",80465.0,"To find Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total fees paid:
   - Legal fees: 2% of $550,000 = 0.02 * $550,000 = $11,000
   - Realtor fee: 5% of $550,000 = 0.05 * $550,000 = $27,500
   - Total fees = $11,000 + $27,500 = $38,500

2. Calculate the net proceeds from selling the villa:
   - Selling price = $550,000
   - Total fees = $38,500
   - Loan amount = $440,000
   - Closing costs = $5,000
   - Total deductions = $38,500 + $440,000 + $5,000 = $483,500
   - Net proceeds = $550,000 - $483,500 = $66,500

3. Calculate the gain from investing in stocks for two years:
   - Initial investment = $66,500
   - Annual gain = 10% of the current balance
   - After 1st year = $66,500 + (10% of $66,500) = $66,500 + $6,650 = $73,150
   - After 2nd year = $73,150 + (10% of $73,150) = $73,150 + $7,315 = $80,465

Dr. Brown sold his villa for $550000.
He paid the legal fees that amounted to 2% of the selling price, which is 0.02 * $550000 = $11000.
He also paid a realtor fee that is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $550000 = $27500.
The total fees paid are $11000 + $27500 = $38500.
He also paid $440000 for the remaining loan amount on the villa, and $5000 for closing costs.
So, the total amount deducted is $38500 + $440000 + $5000 = $483500.
However, since the loan amount is part of the original cost and not a direct deduction from the proceeds, we should calculate the net proceeds first by deducting the fees and costs directly related to the sale: $550000 - $38500 - $5000 = $483500 is incorrect for this step because it includes the loan. The correct step is: The net proceeds before paying the loan are $550000 - $38500 - $5000 = $510500 (deducting only the fees and costs directly related to the sale, not the loan).
Then, Dr. Brown used these proceeds to pay off the loan, so the actual amount he had after selling the villa and before investing is $510500 - $440000 = $70500.
The stocks gained 10% each year for two years. 
In the first year, the gain is 10% of $70500, which is 0.10 * $70500 = $7050.

   - For the next 4 kgs (since she bought 21 kgs in total), the cost is 4 kgs * ₺22/kg * 3/4 = 4 * 22 * 0.75 = ₺66.

   - Total puppies = 131
   - Initially spotted puppies = 23
   - Unspotted puppies = 131 - 23 = 108
   - After the vet visit, half of the unspotted puppies were found to have spots: 108 / 2 = 54

2. **Gabriel's puppies:**
   - Total puppies = 47
   - Spotted puppies = 13

3. **Yuki's puppies:**
   - Since Yuki has 54 dogs and each dog has 13 puppies with spots, we calculate the total number of spotted puppies from Yuki's dogs as 54 * 13 = 702. However, the problem statement does not clarify if Yuki's dogs are part of the total count of puppies or if we should only consider the puppies directly mentioned. For the sake of calculation, we will assume Yuki's puppies are part of the total count, but we must remember this assumption might not fully align with the question's intent.

**Total spotted puppies:**
- Jamal's spotted puppies = 77
- Gabriel's spotted puppies = 13
- Yuki's spotted puppies = 702 (assuming each of Yuki's 54 dogs contributes 13 spotted puppies)
- Total spotted puppies = 77 + 13 + 702 = 792

**Total puppies:**
- Jamal's puppies = 131
- Gabriel's puppies = 47
- Since Yuki's contribution is counted in terms of puppies (each having 13 spotted ones), and assuming each of Yuki's 54 dogs has at least 13 puppies, we have a minimum of 54 * 13 = 702 puppies from Yuki, but for a total count, we should consider all puppies from Yuki's dogs, not just the ones with spots. The problem does not specify the total number of puppies per dog for Yuki, so we must assume each dog has at least 13 puppies for the spotted count, but the actual number could be higher. For simplicity and based on the given information, we calculate the total puppies as follows:
  - Total puppies from Jamal and Gabriel = 131 + 47 = 178
  - Total puppies from Yuki (considering each dog has at least 13 puppies) = 54 * 13 = 702

In total, Jamal's dog has 23 + 54 = 77 puppies with spots.

Gabriel's dog has 47 puppies, with 13 having spots.
Yuki has 54 dogs, each having 13 puppies with spots, so Yuki has 54 * 13 = 702 puppies with spots.

Later, Uma saw another 10-foot shark with 6 remoras, each 8 inches long, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?",45.0,"## Step 1: Calculate the number of remoras that swam away from the first shark.
To find out how many remoras swam away, we need to calculate 1/6 of the total number of remoras attached to the first shark. The total number of remoras is 18. So, 1/6 of 18 is (1/6) * 18 = 3 remoras.

## Step 2: Calculate the number of remoras remaining on the first shark.
After 3 remoras swam away, the number of remoras remaining on the first shark is 18 - 3 = 15 remoras.

## Step 3: Calculate the total length of the remoras on the first shark.
Each remora is 16 inches long. Since there are 15 remoras remaining, the total length covered by the remoras is 15 * 16 inches.

## Step 4: Convert the length of the remoras on the first shark to feet.
Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert the total length of the remoras from inches to feet. The total length in inches is 15 * 16 = 240 inches. Converting to feet, we have 240 / 12 = 20 feet.

## Step 5: Calculate the percentage of the first shark's body covered by the remoras.
The first shark is 40 feet long. The remoras cover 20 feet of its body. To find the percentage, we use the formula (part/whole) * 100. So, (20/40) * 100 = 50%.

## Step 6: Calculate the total length of the remoras on the second shark.
Each remora on the second shark is 8 inches long, and there are 6 remoras. So, the total length covered by these remoras is 6 * 8 inches.

## Step 7: Convert the length of the remoras on the second shark to feet.
The total length in inches is 6 * 8 = 48 inches. Converting to feet, we have 48 / 12 = 4 feet.

## Step 8: Calculate the percentage of the second shark's body covered by the remoras.
The second shark is 10 feet long. The remoras cover 4 feet of its body. Using the same formula as before, (4/10) * 100 = 40%.

## Step 9: Calculate the average percentage of each shark's body covered by the remoras.
To find the average percentage, we add the percentages of both sharks and then divide by 2. The average percentage is (50 + 40) / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$",45.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the 40-foot shark. 
The 40-foot shark has 18 remoras, but then 1/6 of them swam away. 
1/6 of 18 is 18 / 6 = 3 remoras that swam away.
So, the 40-foot shark has 18 - 3 = 15 remoras left.
Each remora is 16 inches long, which is 16 / 12 = 1.33 feet.
The total length of the remoras on the 40-foot shark is 15 * 1.33 = 20 feet.
The percentage of the 40-foot shark's body covered by the remoras is (20 / 40) * 100 = 50%.

Next, we calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the 10-foot shark.
The 10-foot shark has 6 remoras, each 8 inches long, which is 8 / 12 = 0.67 feet.
The total length of the remoras on the 10-foot shark is 6 * 0.67 = 4 feet.
The percentage of the 10-foot shark's body covered by the remoras is (4 / 10) * 100 = 40%.

To find the average percentage, we add the percentages and divide by 2: (50 + 40) / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45%.

Carlos has 720 almonds, 7 bowls and 3 tables. Unfortunately, 2 tables break. Carlos then eats one-fifth of all the almonds. How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?",14.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the capacity of each table.
Each table can hold three times the capacity of a bowl. Since each bowl can hold 24 almonds, each table can hold 3 * 24 = 72 almonds.

Step 2: Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and tables before any tables break.
Carlos has 7 bowls, so the total capacity of the bowls is 7 * 24 = 168 almonds.
He also has 3 tables, so the total capacity of the tables is 3 * 72 = 216 almonds.
Therefore, the total capacity before any tables break is 168 + 216 = 384 almonds.

Step 3: Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and tables after 2 tables break.
After 2 tables break, Carlos is left with 1 table.
The capacity of 1 table is 72 almonds.
The total capacity of the bowls remains the same, which is 168 almonds.
So, the new total capacity after 2 tables break is 168 + 72 = 240 almonds.

Step 4: Calculate the number of almonds remaining after Carlos eats one-fifth of them.
Carlos starts with 720 almonds and eats one-fifth of them. One-fifth of 720 is 720 / 5 = 144 almonds.
So, Carlos eats 144 almonds, leaving him with 720 - 144 = 576 almonds.

Step 5: Determine how many more bowls Carlos needs to hold the remaining almonds.
The total capacity of the bowls and tables after 2 tables break is 240 almonds, but Carlos has 576 almonds left.
He needs space for 576 - 240 = 336 more almonds.
Since each bowl can hold 24 almonds, the number of additional bowls needed is 336 / 24 = 14.

The final answer is 14.",14.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many almonds each table can hold. Since each table can hold three times as many almonds as a bowl, and each bowl can hold 24 almonds, each table can hold 3 * 24 = 72 almonds.
Carlos has 7 bowls, so the total number of almonds the bowls can hold is 7 * 24 = 168 almonds.
Carlos originally had 3 tables, but 2 tables break, so he has 3 - 2 = 1 table left. This table can hold 72 almonds.
The total number of almonds that the remaining tables and bowls can hold is 168 (from bowls) + 72 (from 1 table) = 240 almonds.
Carlos has 720 almonds initially. He eats one-fifth of all the almonds, which is 720 / 5 = 144 almonds.
So, the number of almonds left is 720 - 144 = 576 almonds.
Since Carlos can only place 240 almonds in the bowls and the remaining table, he needs to place 576 - 240 = 336 more almonds.
Each bowl can hold 24 almonds, so to find out how many more bowls Carlos needs, we divide the number of almonds he needs to place (336) by the number of almonds each bowl can hold (24).
The number of additional bowls needed is 336 / 24 = 14.

What will be the average of all four in 4 years?",25.0,"To find the average age of all four in 4 years, we need to calculate their ages in 4 years.

## Step 1: Calculate Aisha's age in 9 years
In 9 years, Aisha will be 2 times as old as Diego is now. Diego is 19 years old now, so Aisha will be 2 * 19 = 38 years old in 9 years.

## Step 2: Calculate Aisha's current age
Since Aisha will be 38 years old in 9 years, her current age is 38 - 9 = 29 years old.

## Step 3: Calculate Esteban's current age
Esteban is 6 years younger than Diego, who is 19 years old. So, Esteban's current age is 19 - 6 = 13 years old.

## Step 4: Calculate Nadia's current age
Nadia is 10 years older than Esteban, who is 13 years old. So, Nadia's current age is 13 + 10 = 23 years old.

Diego's age in 4 years: 19 + 4 = 23 years old.
Aisha's age in 4 years: 29 + 4 = 33 years old.
Esteban's age in 4 years: 13 + 4 = 17 years old.
Nadia's age in 4 years: 23 + 4 = 27 years old.

## Step 6: Calculate the average age of all four in 4 years
Average age = (23 + 33 + 17 + 27) / 4 = 100 / 4 = 25 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$",25.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Diego is 19 years old now.
In 9 years, his cousin Aisha will be 2 times as old as Diego is now, so Aisha will be 2 * 19 = 38 years old in 9 years.

It takes 5 skeins of wool to make a shawl, 6 for a sweater, 8 for a poncho, 8 for a pair of gloves, and 14 for a pair of mittens. Keisha wants to make two warm jackets for herself, each needing 8 skeins of wool. Each dozen skeins of wool costs $7. The store has a promotion where customers receive a $20 discount on purchases over $100. How much should Keisha pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?",85.0,"## Step 1: Calculate the total amount of wool needed for each type of clothing for the quadruplets.
First, we need to calculate the total amount of wool needed for each type of clothing for the quadruplets. For shawls, it's 5 skeins * 4 = 20 skeins. For sweaters, it's 6 skeins * 4 = 24 skeins. For ponchos, it's 8 skeins * 4 = 32 skeins. For gloves, it's 8 skeins * 4 = 32 skeins. For mittens, it's 14 skeins * 4 = 56 skeins.

## Step 2: Calculate the total amount of wool needed for Keisha's jackets.
Keisha wants to make two warm jackets for herself, each needing 8 skeins of wool. So, the total amount of wool needed for her jackets is 8 skeins * 2 = 16 skeins.

## Step 3: Calculate the total amount of wool needed for all the clothing.
Now, we add up the total amount of wool needed for the quadruplets and Keisha. Total wool = 20 (shawls) + 24 (sweaters) + 32 (ponchos) + 32 (gloves) + 56 (mittens) + 16 (jackets) = 180 skeins.

## Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the wool before the discount.
Each dozen skeins of wool costs $7. Since there are 12 skeins in a dozen, the cost per skein is $7 / 12. The total cost before the discount is (180 skeins * $7 / 12).

## Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the wool before the discount in dollars.
Total cost before discount = (180 * $7) / 12 = $105.

## Step 6: Apply the $20 discount if the total cost exceeds $100.
Since the total cost before the discount ($105) exceeds $100, Keisha receives a $20 discount.

## Step 7: Calculate the final cost after the discount.
Final cost = Total cost before discount - Discount = $105 - $20 = $85.

The final answer is: $\boxed{85}$",85.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
Keisha has 4 grandchildren, and she wants to make a shawl, sweater, poncho, gloves, and mittens for each of them.
Each shawl takes 5 skeins of wool, so for 4 grandchildren, she needs 4 * 5 = 20 skeins.
Each sweater takes 6 skeins of wool, so for 4 grandchildren, she needs 4 * 6 = 24 skeins.
Each poncho takes 8 skeins of wool, so for 4 grandchildren, she needs 4 * 8 = 32 skeins.
Each pair of gloves takes 8 skeins of wool, so for 4 grandchildren, she needs 4 * 8 = 32 skeins.
Each pair of mittens takes 14 skeins of wool, so for 4 grandchildren, she needs 4 * 14 = 56 skeins.
Now, let's add up all the skeins needed for the grandchildren: 20 + 24 + 32 + 32 + 56 = 164 skeins.
Keisha also wants to make 2 warm jackets for herself, each needing 8 skeins of wool, so she needs 2 * 8 = 16 skeins for herself.
In total, Keisha needs 164 + 16 = 180 skeins of wool.
Since each dozen skeins costs $7, and there are 12 skeins in a dozen, the cost per skein is $7 / 12 = $0.5833.
So, the total cost for 180 skeins is 180 * $0.5833 = $105.
However, the store has a promotion where customers receive a $20 discount on purchases over $100, and Keisha's purchase is over $100.
Therefore, Keisha gets a $20 discount on her purchase.
The total amount Keisha should pay is $105 - $20 = $85.

He has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 3 kgs of rice per day. The store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs; any additional rice is sold at the regular price. Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2. How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,"## Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice Mohammed needs to buy for a week.
Mohammed uses 3 kgs of rice per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, he needs 3 * 7 = 21 kgs of rice.

## Step 2: Determine the cost of the more expensive brand of rice per kg.
The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find 20% of ¥15, we multiply ¥15 by 0.20, which equals ¥3. So, the more expensive brand costs ¥15 + ¥3 = ¥18 per kg.

## Step 3: Calculate the cost of the rice before any discounts.
Since Mohammed needs 21 kgs of rice and the more expensive brand costs ¥18 per kg, the total cost before any discounts is 21 * ¥18 = ¥378.

## Step 4: Apply the 40% discount to the first 10 kgs of rice.
The first 10 kgs of rice qualify for a 40% discount. The cost of 10 kgs at ¥18 per kg is 10 * ¥18 = ¥180. A 40% discount on ¥180 is ¥180 * 0.40 = ¥72. So, the cost of the first 10 kgs after the discount is ¥180 - ¥72 = ¥108.

## Step 5: Calculate the cost of the remaining rice after the first 10 kgs.
Mohammed needs 21 kgs in total, so after the first 10 kgs, he has 21 - 10 = 11 kgs left. These 11 kgs are sold at the regular price of ¥18 per kg, making the cost 11 * ¥18 = ¥198.

## Step 6: Calculate the total cost of the rice.
Adding the cost of the first 10 kgs after the discount (¥108) to the cost of the remaining 11 kgs (¥198) gives a total cost for the rice of ¥108 + ¥198 = ¥306.

## Step 7: Add the cost of the bagel to the total cost of the rice.
Mohammed also buys a bagel for ¥2. So, the final amount he has to pay is ¥306 (for the rice) + ¥2 (for the bagel) = ¥308.

The final answer is: $\boxed{308}$",308.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
Mohammed uses 3 kgs of rice per day.
He needs to buy a week's worth of rice, which is 7 days.
So, the total amount of rice he needs is 3 kgs/day * 7 days = 21 kgs.
The normal brand of rice costs ¥15 per kg, but he has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more.
20% of ¥15 is ¥15 * 0.2 = ¥3.
So, the more expensive brand costs ¥15 + ¥3 = ¥18 per kg.
The store has a 40% discount on rice, which applies only up to 10 kgs.
The discount on 10 kgs of rice is 40% of ¥18 * 10 = 0.4 * ¥180 = ¥72.
So, the price of 10 kgs of rice with the discount is ¥180 - ¥72 = ¥108.
He needs 21 kgs of rice, so he will have to pay the discounted price for the first 10 kgs and the regular price for the remaining 11 kgs.
The price for the remaining 11 kgs is ¥18 * 11 = ¥198.
The total cost of the rice is ¥108 + ¥198 = ¥306.
Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2.

However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,"## Step 1: Calculate the total number of signatures collected by both sisters before the last 2 weeks of spring break.
Jasmine has 36 signatures and Mia has 31 signatures, so together they have 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

## Step 2: Calculate the total number of signatures needed by both sisters to reach their goal.
The sisters want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break.

## Step 3: Determine the number of signatures still needed to reach the goal.
To find out how many more signatures they need, subtract the total signatures they already have from the goal: 145 - 67 = 78 signatures.

## Step 4: Calculate Jasmine's reduced weekly signature collection.
Since Jasmine can only collect signatures on weekends, her collection is reduced. However, we first need to determine her original weekly collection rate to understand the reduction. Given that she collected 36 signatures over 6 weeks, her original weekly rate was 36 / 6 = 6 signatures per week. With a reduction of 5 signatures per week, her new weekly collection rate is 6 - 5 = 1 signature per week.

## Step 5: Calculate the total number of signatures Jasmine will collect over the last 2 weeks.
With her reduced rate of 1 signature per week, over 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect 1 * 2 = 2 signatures.

## Step 6: Determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect over the last 2 weeks to reach the goal.
Since they need 78 more signatures in total and Jasmine will collect 2 of those, Mia needs to collect 78 - 2 = 76 signatures over the last 2 weeks.

## Step 7: Calculate how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week to reach the goal.
To find out how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week, divide the total number of signatures she needs to collect by the number of weeks: 76 / 2 = 38 signatures per week.

So, the number of signatures they still need to collect is 145 - 67 = 78.
They have 2 weeks left to collect these signatures.
Since Jasmine can only collect signatures on weekends, her weekly collection is reduced by 5, but we don't know her original weekly collection to calculate the reduction.
However, we can calculate the total signatures each sister collected per week on average during the first 6 weeks.
Jasmine collected 36 signatures in 6 weeks, so her average weekly collection is 36 / 6 = 6 signatures per week.
Mia collected 31 signatures in 6 weeks, so her average weekly collection is 31 / 6 = 5.17 signatures per week.
Since Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5, and assuming she collected at least 5 signatures per week, her new weekly collection would be 6 - 5 = 1 signature per week.
In the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect 1 * 2 = 2 signatures.
So, Mia needs to collect 78 - 2 = 76 signatures in the remaining 2 weeks.

He makes 48 total ice cubes, including 10 giant cubes, 14 small cubes, 12 medium cubes, and some tiny cubes. How many ounces of water does Leon have left?",122.0,"To find out how many ounces of water Leon has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used to make the ice cubes and subtract that from the initial 312 ounces.

1. Calculate the water used for the giant cubes:
   - 10 giant cubes * 12 ounces per cube = 120 ounces

2. Calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
   - 12 medium cubes * 5 ounces per cube = 60 ounces

3. Calculate the water used for the small cubes:
   - 14 small cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 7 ounces

4. Since Leon makes a total of 48 ice cubes and we know the number of giant, medium, and small cubes, we can find the number of tiny cubes:
   - Total cubes = Giant + Medium + Small + Tiny
   - 48 = 10 + 12 + 14 + Tiny
   - Tiny = 48 - 10 - 12 - 14 = 12 tiny cubes

So, the total water used for giant cubes is 10 * 12 = 120 ounces.
He makes 14 small cubes, each using 1/2 ounce of water.
So, the total water used for small cubes is 14 * 0.5 = 7 ounces.
He makes 12 medium cubes, each using 5 ounces of water.

Since there are 160 students in total and 152 like the activities mentioned, the number of students who like playing video games is 160 - 152 = 8.

## Step 5: Calculate the percentage of students who like playing video games.
To find the percentage, divide the number of students who like playing video games by the total number of students and multiply by 100. So, (8 / 160) * 100 = 5%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",5.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
The total number of students in the class is 160.
We know that 69 like to hike, 8 like to play chess, 13 like to swim, and 13 like to play football.
So, the total number of students who like these activities is 69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103.
The number of students who like to either play video games or bake is 160 - 103 = 57.
We are told that the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football.
Since 13 students like to play football, four times this number is 4 * 13 = 52.
Three less than this is 52 - 3 = 49.
So, the number of students who like to bake is 49.
This means the number of students who like to play video games is 57 - 49 = 8.
To find the percentage of students who like to play video games, we divide the number of students who like to play video games by the total number of students and multiply by 100.
The percentage is (8 / 160) * 100 = 5%.

Oliver has also applied for help from the local charity, which has decided to cover 1/10 of the remaining cost of the workshop. How much money is Oliver still missing?",113.0,"To find out how much money Oliver is still missing, let's break down the costs and calculate step by step.

1. **Total Cost for 2 Days:**
   - Hotel: ₣100/day * 2 days = ₣200
   - Food: ₣20/day * 2 days = ₣40
   - Transportation: ₣10/day * 2 days = ₣20
   - Total cost = ₣200 (hotel) + ₣40 (food) + ₣20 (transportation) = ₣260

2. **Friends' Contribution:**
   - Friends will cover the cost of all the food, which is ₣40.

3. **Remaining Cost After Friends' Contribution:**
   - Remaining cost = Total cost - Friends' contribution = ₣260 - ₣40 = ₣220

4. **Charity's Contribution:**
   - Charity will cover 1/10 of the remaining cost, which is 1/10 * ₣220 = ₣22.

5. **Remaining Cost After Charity's Contribution:**
   - Remaining cost = ₣220 - ₣22 = ₣198

6. **Oliver's Contribution:**
   - Oliver has ₣85.

7. **Amount Oliver is Still Missing:**

The total cost for the 2-day workshop is calculated by adding the costs for hotel, food, and transportation for each day.
The cost for each day is ₣100 (hotel) + ₣20 (food) + ₣10 (transportation) = ₣130.
For 2 days, the total cost is 2 * ₣130 = ₣260.
Oliver's friends will cover the cost of all the food, which is ₣20 * 2 = ₣40.

How much more do 4 loaves of bread cost than 8 bagels?",12.0,"## Step 1: Calculate the cost of one bagel
The cost of a bagel is one-fourth of the cost of a loaf of bread. Since a loaf of bread costs €5, the cost of a bagel is €5 * 1/4 = €1.25.

## Step 2: Calculate the cost of 8 bagels without discount
The cost of 8 bagels without any discount is 8 * €1.25 = €10.

## Step 3: Apply the 20% discount to the cost of 8 bagels
Since the bakery offers a 20% discount on 7 or more bagels, the cost of 8 bagels with the discount is €10 - (20% of €10) = €10 - €2 = €8.

## Step 4: Calculate the cost of 4 loaves of bread
The cost of 4 loaves of bread is 4 * €5 = €20.

First, we need to find the cost of a bagel. Since the cost of a bagel is one-fourth of a loaf of bread, and a loaf of bread costs €5, the cost of a bagel is 5 / 4 = €1.25.
Next, we need to calculate the cost of 8 bagels. Since 8 bagels qualify for the 20% discount, we first find the original cost of 8 bagels, which is 8 * €1.25 = €10. Then, we apply the 20% discount: 20% of €10 is 0.20 * €10 = €2. So, the cost of 8 bagels with the discount is €10 - €2 = €8.
Now, we calculate the cost of 4 loaves of bread. Each loaf costs €5, so 4 loaves cost 4 * €5 = €20.
Finally, to find out how much more 4 loaves of bread cost than 8 bagels, we subtract the cost of 8 bagels from the cost of 4 loaves of bread: €20 - €8 = €12.

How much more money does Elena have left than Jamal after they leave the store?",8.0,"## Step 1: Calculate the total cost of anchors for Elena
Elena wants to buy 15 anchors, each costing $0.26. The total cost of anchors for Elena is 15 * $0.26 = $3.90.

## Step 2: Calculate the total cost of nails for Elena
Elena needs 9 nails, each costing $0.61. The total cost of nails for Elena is 9 * $0.61 = $5.49.

## Step 3: Calculate the total cost of paint for Elena
Elena picks up 10 gallons of paint, each priced at $7.0. The total cost of paint for Elena is 10 * $7.0 = $70.00.

## Step 4: Calculate the total cost of all items for Elena
The total cost of all items for Elena is $3.90 (anchors) + $5.49 (nails) + $70.00 (paint) = $79.39.

She buys 10 gallons of paint at $7.0 each, so the cost of paint is 10 * $7.0 = $70.00.
The total cost for Elena is $3.90 + $5.49 + $70.00 = $79.39.
So, Elena has $98.39 - $79.39 = $19.00 left.

Jamal starts with $80.
He buys 10 gallons of paint at $7.0 each, but as a member, he gets a 10% discount on paint.
The original cost of paint is 10 * $7.0 = $70.00.

After 2 days, DeShawn decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half. How many days will it take for the cake to be fully eaten?",4.0,"To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine how much each person can eat per day.
- Arash can eat 5 pieces per day.
- Ava can eat twice as much as Arash, so Ava can eat 5 * 2 = 10 pieces per day.
- DeShawn can eat twice as much as Ava, so DeShawn can eat 10 * 2 = 20 pieces per day.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount eaten per day before DeShawn goes on a diet.
- Arash eats 5 pieces per day.
- Ava eats 10 pieces per day.
- DeShawn eats 20 pieces per day.
- Total eaten per day before diet = 5 + 10 + 20 = 35 pieces per day.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount eaten in the first 2 days before DeShawn goes on a diet.
- Total eaten in 2 days = 35 * 2 = 70 pieces.

Step 4: Determine how much DeShawn eats after going on a diet.
- DeShawn originally eats 20 pieces per day.
- After going on a diet, DeShawn cuts consumption by half, so DeShawn eats 20 / 2 = 10 pieces per day.

Step 5: Calculate the new total amount eaten per day after DeShawn goes on a diet.
- Arash still eats 5 pieces per day.
- Ava still eats 10 pieces per day.
- DeShawn now eats 10 pieces per day.
- New total eaten per day after diet = 5 + 10 + 10 = 25 pieces per day.

Step 6: Calculate the remaining cake after 2 days.

- Pieces eaten per day after diet = 25.
- Days to eat remaining cake = 50 / 25 = 2 days.

Step 8: Calculate the total number of days to eat the entire cake.
- Days before DeShawn goes on a diet = 2 days.

For the first 2 days, the total consumption per day is 5 (Arash) + 10 (Ava) + 20 (DeShawn) = 35 pieces per day.
After 2 days, they would have eaten 35 * 2 = 70 pieces.
So, 120 - 70 = 50 pieces are left after 2 days.
Then, DeShawn decides to go on a diet and cut his consumption by half, which means he eats 20 / 2 = 10 pieces a day.
Now, the total consumption per day is 5 (Arash) + 10 (Ava) + 10 (DeShawn) = 25 pieces per day.
To eat the remaining 50 pieces, it will take 50 / 25 = 2 days.
Since they already ate for 2 days, the total number of days it will take for the cake to be fully eaten is 2 (initial days) + 2 (additional days) = 4 days.

On Wednesday, he sold 27 boxes of muffin and 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie, than on Thursday. On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday and 21 boxes of apricot pie. On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?",796.0,"## Step 1: Determine the number of boxes of muffins and apricot pies sold on Wednesday.
Let's denote the number of boxes of muffins sold on Wednesday as \(M_W\) and the number of boxes of apricot pies sold on Wednesday as \(P_W\). We know that \(M_W = 27\). Since Faisal sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie on Wednesday than on Thursday, and he sold 21 boxes of apricot pie on Thursday, we have \(P_W = 21 - 13 = 8\).

## Step 2: Calculate the number of boxes of muffins and apricot pies sold on Thursday.
We denote the number of boxes of muffins sold on Thursday as \(M_T\) and the number of boxes of apricot pies sold on Thursday as \(P_T\). It's given that \(P_T = 21\). Since Faisal sold 11 more boxes of muffins on Thursday than on Wednesday, we have \(M_T = M_W + 11 = 27 + 11 = 38\).

## Step 3: Calculate the total number of boxes of muffins and apricot pies sold on Friday.
Since Faisal sold as much on Friday as he did in the past two days combined, the total number of boxes of muffins sold on Friday is \(M_F = M_W + M_T = 27 + 38 = 65\), and the total number of boxes of apricot pies sold on Friday is \(P_F = P_W + P_T = 8 + 21 = 29\).

## Step 4: Calculate the total earnings for each day.
- On Wednesday, the earnings from muffins are \(27 \times 9 = 243\) and from apricot pies are \(8 \times 21 = 168\), making the total earnings for Wednesday \(243 + 168 = 411\).
- On Thursday, the earnings from muffins are \(38 \times 9 = 342\) and from apricot pies are \(21 \times 21 = 441\), making the total earnings for Thursday \(342 + 441 = 783\).
- On Friday, the earnings from muffins are \(65 \times 9 = 585\) and from apricot pies are \(29 \times 21 = 609\), making the total earnings for Friday \(585 + 609 = 1194\).

## Step 5: Calculate the total earnings over the three days and find the average daily earnings.
The total earnings over the three days are \(411 + 783 + 1194 = 2388\). To find the average daily earnings, we divide the total earnings by the number of days: \(2388 / 3 = 796\).

The final answer is: $\boxed{796}$",796.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
On Wednesday, Faisal sold 27 boxes of muffins.
He sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie than on Thursday, but we don't know the Thursday amount yet, so let's call the number of apricot pies sold on Thursday ""x"". Then, on Wednesday, he sold x - 13 boxes of apricot pie.

On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday, which is 27 + 11 = 38 boxes of muffins.
He also sold 21 boxes of apricot pie on Thursday. Since we called the number of apricot pies sold on Thursday ""x"", we can say x = 21.

Now we know that on Thursday, x = 21, so on Wednesday, he sold x - 13 = 21 - 13 = 8 boxes of apricot pie.

On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. So, for muffins, he sold (27 + 38) = 65 boxes of muffins on Friday.
For apricot pies, he sold (8 + 21) = 29 boxes of apricot pie on Friday.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:
On Wednesday, Faisal sold 27 boxes of muffins and 8 boxes of apricot pie.
The earnings from muffins are 27 * ₺9 = ₺243.
The earnings from apricot pies are 8 * ₺21 = ₺168.
The total earnings on Wednesday are ₺243 + ₺168 = ₺411.

On Thursday, Faisal sold 38 boxes of muffins and 21 boxes of apricot pie.
The earnings from muffins are 38 * ₺9 = ₺342.
The earnings from apricot pies are 21 * ₺21 = ₺441.
The total earnings on Thursday are ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783.

On Friday, Faisal sold 65 boxes of muffins and 29 boxes of apricot pie.
The earnings from muffins are 65 * ₺9 = ₺585.
The earnings from apricot pies are 29 * ₺21 = ₺609.
The total earnings on Friday are ₺585 + ₺609 = ₺1194.

   - Swimmers going = 30
   - Choir members or dancers = 27
   - Total students going (excluding cheerleaders) = 30 + 27 = 57 students

7. **Calculate the total number of cheerleaders accompanying the groups:**
   - Each group (swimmers, choir members/dancers) has 3 cheerleaders accompanying them.
   - Since there are 3 distinct groups (swimmers, choir, dancers), but the problem mentions ""these 3 groups"" will have cheerleaders, we interpret this as each of the main groups (swimmers, and the combined choir/dancers) gets cheerleaders.

Out of the remaining class, 45% are choir members or part of dancers, so the number of choir members or dancers is 45% of 60, which is 0.45 * 60 = 27 students.
Half of the swimmers are absent for being sick, so the number of swimmers leaving early is 60 / 2 = 30 students.
The total number of students leaving early from the swimmers, choir members, and dancers is 30 (swimmers) + 27 (choir members or dancers) = 57 students.
Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. Since there are 3 groups (swimmers, choir members, and dancers), the total number of cheerleaders is 3 * 3 = 9 students.
However, the problem statement about the 3 groups might be interpreted as having 3 cheerleaders for each type of group (swimmers, choir/dancers), but since it says ""these 3 groups"" it implies the 3 cheerleaders are for the entire event, not each group. Thus, we should consider 3 cheerleaders in total for the event, not 9.
The total number of students leaving early, including the cheerleaders, is 57 (swimmers, choir members, and dancers) + 3 (cheerleaders) = 60 students.
The answer is 60.",60.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
The total number of students in Mrs. Garcia's class is 120.

45% of the remaining class are choir members or part of dancers, so the number of choir members or dancers is 60 * 0.45 = 27.
The number of students who are neither swimmers nor choir members or dancers is 60 - 27 = 33.
Half of the swimmers are absent, so the number of swimmers leaving early is 60 * 0.5 = 30.
The total number of students leaving early for the tournament is the sum of the swimmers, choir members, and dancers, which is 30 + 27 = 57.
Additionally, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups, but since there are 3 groups (swimmers, choir members, and dancers), we only need to add 3 cheerleaders for each of the groups that are going, so 3 cheerleaders will be added to the total.
So, the total number of students and cheerleaders leaving early is 57 + 3 = 60, but since the 3 groups (swimmers, choir, and dancers) each need 3 cheerleaders, this means we need 3 * 3 = 9 cheerleaders for the 3 different groups, so we add 9 to the 57 students.

Olga's flowers grow 3meters wide so she needs to leave 12 meters between every plant (including the plants width). Olga already owns 7 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ₣9 at the store. However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",31.0,"To determine how much money Olga will spend at the store, we need to calculate the total number of plants she needs to fill her flower bed.

1. First, let's calculate the total space required for each plant, including the 12 meters of space between plants and the plant's width. 
   The total space required for each plant = plant width + space between plants = 3m + 12m = 15m

2. Now, let's calculate the total number of plants Olga can fit in her flower bed.
   Since the first plant will be placed at the beginning of the bed, we only need to account for the space between plants for the remaining plants.
   Total length of the flower bed = 132m
   Space required for the first plant = 3m (since we don't need to add the 12m space before the first plant)
   Remaining length for the rest of the plants = 132m - 3m = 129m
   Number of 12m spaces that can fit in the remaining length = 129m / 12m = 10.75 (round down to 10 since we can't have a fraction of a space)
   Since we have 10 spaces, we can fit 10 + 1 (for the first plant) = 11 plants in the flower bed.

3. However, Olga already owns 7 flowers, so she only needs to buy 11 - 7 = 4 more plants.

4. Now, let's calculate the cost of the plants.
   Each plant costs ₣9, so the total cost without discount = 4 * ₣9 = ₣36
   Since Olga is buying more than 2 plants, she will receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase.
   Total cost with discount = ₣36 - ₣5 = ₣31

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, Olga will need 9 plants to fill her flower bed (rounding up from 8.8 to ensure the bed is filled).
Olga already owns 7 flowers, so she needs to buy 9 - 7 = 2 more flowers.
Each flower costs ₣9, so 2 flowers will cost 2 * ₣9 = ₣18.

How many minutes will it take her to peel and saute 150 clams if it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam before peeling it? Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.,163.0,"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate time to wash the clams**: 
   - Time to wash one clam = 12 seconds
   - Number of clams = 150
   - Total time to wash clams = 150 * 12 seconds = 1800 seconds
   - Convert seconds to minutes = 1800 / 60 = 30 minutes

2. **Calculate time to peel the clams**:
   - Olga can peel 6 clams per minute
   - Number of clams = 150
   - Time to peel the clams = 150 / 6 = 25 minutes

3. **Calculate time for the break**:
   - Olga takes a 13-minute break after peeling

4. **Calculate time to sauté the clams**:
   - Olga can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes
   - Number of clams = 150
   - First, find out how many sets of 30 clams are there in 150 clams: 150 / 30 = 5
   - Since she can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes, she can sauté 150 clams in 5 * 19 minutes = 95 minutes

5. **Add all the times together**:
   - Time to wash = 30 minutes
   - Time to peel = 25 minutes
   - Break time = 13 minutes
   - Time to sauté = 95 minutes
   - Total time = 30 + 25 + 13 + 95 = 163 minutes

So, it will take Olga 163 minutes to peel and sauté 150 clams.",150.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
First, we need to calculate the time it takes Olga to peel 150 clams. 
Olga can peel 6 clams in 1 minute.
So, the time it takes to peel 150 clams is 150 / 6 = 25 minutes.
However, before peeling, she needs to wash each clam, and it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam.
There are 150 clams, so the total washing time is 150 * 12 seconds = 1800 seconds.
Since 1 minute = 60 seconds, the total washing time in minutes is 1800 / 60 = 30 minutes.
Therefore, the total time spent on washing and peeling is 30 + 25 = 55 minutes.
After peeling, Olga takes a 13-minute break.
So, the total time spent before sautéing is 55 + 13 = 68 minutes.
Now, we need to calculate the time it takes Olga to sauté 150 clams.
Olga can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes.
So, the time it takes to sauté 150 clams is (150 / 30) * 19 = 5 * 19 = 95 minutes.
The total time spent is the sum of the time spent before sautéing and the time spent sautéing, which is 68 + 95 = 163 minutes.

If Aisha is sure to get 25% of the geography questions, 100% of the chemistry questions, and a tenth of the history and algebra questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?",49.0,"## Step 1: Calculate the number of chemistry questions
First, we need to find out how many questions are chemistry. Since 40% of the 100 questions are chemistry, we calculate 40% of 100. This is done by multiplying 100 by 0.4. So, 100 * 0.4 = 40 chemistry questions.

## Step 2: Calculate the number of geography questions
Next, we determine the number of geography questions, which is 20% of the total questions. We calculate 20% of 100 by multiplying 100 by 0.2. So, 100 * 0.2 = 20 geography questions.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of history and algebra questions
The rest of the questions are equally divided between history and algebra. Since we have 100 questions in total, and we've already accounted for 40 chemistry and 20 geography questions, that leaves 100 - 40 - 20 = 40 questions for history and algebra. Since these are equally divided, we divide the 40 questions by 2, which gives us 20 questions for each subject.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of geography questions Aisha will get correctly
Aisha is sure to get 25% of the geography questions correct. Since there are 20 geography questions, we calculate 25% of 20 by multiplying 20 by 0.25. So, 20 * 0.25 = 5 geography questions correct.

## Step 5: Calculate the number of chemistry questions Aisha will get correctly
Aisha is sure to get 100% of the chemistry questions correct. Since there are 40 chemistry questions, she will get all 40 correct.

## Step 6: Calculate the number of history and algebra questions Aisha will get correctly
Aisha will get a tenth (10%) of the history and algebra questions correct. Since there are 20 questions for each subject, we calculate 10% of 20 for each.

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 50% for the second half. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?",1755.0,"## Step 1: Calculate the combined number of pizzas the uncle and spouse eat per day.
The uncle eats 10 pizzas per day, and his spouse eats 20 pizzas per day. So, the combined number of pizzas they eat per day is 10 + 20 = 30 pizzas.

## Step 2: Calculate the number of pizzas the grandchild eats per day.
The grandchild eats two-fourths of the combined number of pizzas the uncle and spouse eat per day. Two-fourths is equivalent to 1/2. So, the grandchild eats 1/2 * 30 = 15 pizzas per day.

## Step 3: Calculate the total number of pizzas the family eats per day.
The total number of pizzas the family eats per day is the sum of the pizzas eaten by the uncle, spouse, and grandchild. So, 10 (uncle) + 20 (spouse) + 15 (grandchild) = 45 pizzas per day.

## Step 4: Calculate the total number of pizzas the family eats in the first month.
Since a month has approximately 30 days, the total number of pizzas eaten in the first month is 45 pizzas/day * 30 days = 1350 pizzas.

## Step 5: Calculate the reduced food consumption for the first half of the second month.
The family reduces their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month. So, they eat 40% of their original amount, which is 0.4 * 45 pizzas/day = 18 pizzas/day.

## Step 6: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten in the first half of the second month.
The first half of the month has approximately 15 days. So, the total number of pizzas eaten in the first half of the second month is 18 pizzas/day * 15 days = 270 pizzas.

## Step 7: Calculate the further reduced food consumption for the second half of the second month.
The family reduces their food consumption by an additional 50% for the second half of the month, which means they eat 50% of the already reduced amount. So, they eat 0.5 * 18 pizzas/day = 9 pizzas/day.

## Step 8: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten in the second half of the second month.
The second half of the month also has approximately 15 days. So, the total number of pizzas eaten in the second half of the second month is 9 pizzas/day * 15 days = 135 pizzas.

## Step 9: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten in the second month.
The total number of pizzas eaten in the second month is the sum of the pizzas eaten in the first and second halves, which is 270 pizzas + 135 pizzas = 405 pizzas.

## Step 10: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten in two months.
The total number of pizzas eaten in two months is the sum of the pizzas eaten in the first month and the second month, which is 1350 pizzas + 405 pizzas = 1755 pizzas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1755}$",1755.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
First, we need to calculate the total number of pizzas the family eats per day.
The uncle eats 10 pizzas per day.
The spouse eats 20 pizzas per day.
So, the combined number of pizzas they eat per day is 10 + 20 = 30 pizzas.
The grandchild eats two-fourths of the combined number of pizzas, which is (2/4) * 30 = 15 pizzas per day.
Therefore, the total number of pizzas the family eats per day is 10 + 20 + 15 = 45 pizzas.

Since there are 30 days in a month (approximately), the total number of pizzas they eat in the first month is 45 * 30 = 1350 pizzas.

Now, let's calculate the number of pizzas they eat in the second month.
For the first half of the month (15 days), they reduce their food consumption by 60%.
So, they eat 40% of their original amount, which is 0.4 * 45 = 18 pizzas per day.
For the first half of the month, they eat 18 * 15 = 270 pizzas.
For the second half of the month (15 days), they reduce their food consumption by an additional 50%, which means they eat 50% of the already reduced amount.
So, they eat 0.5 * 18 = 9 pizzas per day.
For the second half of the month, they eat 9 * 15 = 135 pizzas.
Therefore, the total number of pizzas they eat in the second month is 270 + 135 = 405 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas the family eats in two months is 1350 + 405 = 1755 pizzas.

1. **Calculate the number of emails that don't require any response per day:**
   - Total emails per day = 30
   - Emails that don't require any response = 20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6 emails

2. **Calculate the number of emails that require a response per day:**
   - Emails that require a response = Total emails - Emails that don't require any response
   - Emails that require a response = 30 - 6 = 24 emails

3. **Calculate the number of emails Mohammed can respond to per day:**
   - Mohammed can respond to 2 less than 1/2 of the emails that require a response.
   - 1/2 of the emails that require a response = 1/2 * 24 = 12
   - 2 less than 1/2 = 12 - 2 = 10 emails

4. **Calculate the total number of emails Mohammed responds to in a 5-day work week:**

Mohammed receives 30 emails a day.
20% of those emails don't require any response, which is 0.2 * 30 = 6 emails.

Mohammed can respond to 2 less than 1/2 of the emails that require a response. 
1/2 of 24 is 24 / 2 = 12.
2 less than 12 is 12 - 2 = 10 emails.

On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?",85.0,"## Step 1: Determine Ananya's original speed on the beach and sidewalk.
Let's denote Ananya's original speed on the beach as B miles per hour and her original speed on the sidewalk as S miles per hour. We know that S = 2B, since she walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.

## Step 2: Calculate Ananya's new speed on the beach and sidewalk after the injury.
After the injury, Ananya's speed decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. So, her new speed on the beach is B/2 miles per hour and her new speed on the sidewalk is S/2 = 2B/2 = B miles per hour.

## Step 3: Calculate the time spent walking on the beach.
We are given that 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. We need to convert this time into hours to match the units of speed in miles per hour. 50 minutes is equal to 50/60 = 5/6 hours.

## Step 4: Calculate the distance walked on the beach.
The distance walked on the beach can be calculated using the formula Distance = Speed * Time. We know the distance walked on the beach is 10 miles, and the time spent is 5/6 hours. So, we can set up the equation 10 = (B/2) * (5/6) to find B.

## Step 5: Solve for B, Ananya's original speed on the beach.
Rearranging the equation from step 4, we get B/2 = 10 / (5/6) = 10 * (6/5) = 12. Therefore, B = 12 * 2 = 24 miles per hour.

## Step 6: Calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk.
Now that we know Ananya's original speed on the beach, we can find her new speed on the beach, which is 24/2 = 12 miles per hour. We already know her new speed on the sidewalk is B = 12 miles per hour (from step 5, since S/2 = B). The distance walked on the sidewalk is 14 miles. Using the formula Time = Distance / Speed, we can find the time spent walking on the sidewalk: Time = 14 / 12 = 7/6 hours.

## Step 7: Convert the time spent walking on the sidewalk into minutes.
To convert 7/6 hours into minutes, we multiply by 60: (7/6) * 60 = 70 minutes.

## Step 8: Calculate the total time spent on the entire walk.
The total time spent on the walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk: 50 minutes + 70 minutes = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$",120.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
Ananya walks a total of 24 miles, with 10 miles on the beach and 14 miles on the sidewalk.
First, we need to find her original speed on the beach and the sidewalk. Let's denote her original speed on the beach as x miles per hour. Then, her original speed on the sidewalk would be 2x miles per hour, since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk.
However, due to her injury, her speed has decreased by half. So, her new speed on the beach is x/2 miles per hour, and her new speed on the sidewalk is 2x/2 = x miles per hour.
We know that she spends 50 minutes walking on the beach, which is 10 miles. We can use this information to find her new speed on the beach. First, let's convert the time from minutes to hours: 50 minutes / 60 = 5/6 hours.
Now, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time. For the beach, the distance is 10 miles, and the time is 5/6 hours. So, her new speed on the beach is 10 / (5/6) = 10 * 6/5 = 12 miles per hour.
Since her new speed on the beach is x/2, we can set up the equation x/2 = 12 and solve for x: x = 12 * 2 = 24 miles per hour.
Now that we know her original speed on the beach, we can find her new speed on the sidewalk, which is x = 24 miles per hour (since her speed on the sidewalk is 2x/2 = x).
We know the distance on the sidewalk is 14 miles, and we want to find the time it takes to walk this distance at a speed of 24 miles per hour (which is her new speed on the sidewalk, but also equals her original speed on the beach, and the sidewalk speed is twice the beach speed, but since it decreased by half, the new sidewalk speed equals the original beach speed). 
Time = distance / speed = 14 / 24 = 7/12 hours.
Now, let's convert this time from hours to minutes: 7/12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 35 minutes.
So, the time spent walking on the sidewalk is 35 minutes.
The total time for the entire walk is the sum of the time spent walking on the beach and the time spent walking on the sidewalk: 50 minutes + 35 minutes = 85 minutes.

How many cookies are still hidden in the yard?",64.0,"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many cookies Amelia initially had and then follow the sequence of events step by step.

1. Amelia initially had 11 dozen cookies. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, Amelia had:
11 dozen * 12 cookies/dozen = 132 cookies

2. Then, Amelia ate 5 cookies for breakfast, leaving her with:
132 cookies - 5 cookies = 127 cookies

3. Elena finds 5 cookies.

4. Mei finds twice as many as Elena, so Mei finds:
2 * 5 cookies = 10 cookies

5. Xavier finds 2 less than Mei, so Xavier finds:
10 cookies - 2 cookies = 8 cookies

6. Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier, so Mohammed finds:
8 cookies / 8 = 1 cookie

7. Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined. First, calculate how many cookies Mei and Elena found combined:
5 cookies (Elena) + 10 cookies (Mei) = 15 cookies
Two dozen cookies equal 24 cookies, so Umar finds:
15 cookies + 24 cookies = 39 cookies

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies found by all the children:
5 cookies (Elena) + 10 cookies (Mei) + 8 cookies (Xavier) + 1 cookie (Mohammed) + 39 cookies (Umar) = 63 cookies

Finally, to find out how many cookies are still hidden in the yard, subtract the total number of cookies found from the number of cookies Amelia had after eating 5 for breakfast:
127 cookies - 63 cookies = 64 cookies

So, there are 64 cookies still hidden in the yard.",64.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
Amelia initially had 11 dozen cookies. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, she had 11 * 12 = 132 cookies.
She ate 5 cookies for breakfast, leaving her with 132 - 5 = 127 cookies.
These 127 cookies were hidden in the yard for the Easter egg hunt.
Elena finds 5 cookies.
Mei finds twice as many as Elena, which is 2 * 5 = 10 cookies.
Xavier finds 2 less than Mei, so he finds 10 - 2 = 8 cookies.
Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier, which is 8 / 8 = 1 cookie.
Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined. Mei and Elena combined found 10 + 5 = 15 cookies. Two dozen cookies is 2 * 12 = 24 cookies. So, Umar finds 24 + 15 = 39 cookies.
Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies found: 5 (Elena) + 10 (Mei) + 8 (Xavier) + 1 (Mohammed) + 39 (Umar) = 63 cookies.
Initially, there were 127 cookies hidden. After they were found, 63 cookies were taken.
So, the number of cookies still hidden in the yard is 127 - 63 = 64.

The first 2 have 100 apartments each and the last one is 35% bigger than the other 2 combined. However, this week, 9 apartments from each of the first 2 complexes were vacant and did not require collection service. Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each place and he gets paid ₣0.5 per collection for each apartment. He also earns an additional 10% in tips. How much money does he make in a week?",1243.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes.
Each of the first two complexes has 100 apartments. So, combined, they have 100 + 100 = 200 apartments.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
The third complex is 35% bigger than the first two combined. 35% of 200 apartments is 0.35 * 200 = 70 apartments. So, the third complex has 200 + 70 = 270 apartments.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of apartments that required collection service from the first two complexes.
9 apartments from each of the first two complexes were vacant. So, from each complex, 100 - 9 = 91 apartments required collection service. Since there are two complexes, that's 91 * 2 = 182 apartments in total from the first two complexes.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of apartments that required collection service.
Adding the apartments from the third complex (which had no vacancies mentioned), we have 182 (from the first two complexes) + 270 (from the third complex) = 452 apartments.

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of collections per week.
Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each apartment. So, for 452 apartments, he makes 452 * 5 = 2260 collections per week.

### Step 6: Calculate Oscar's weekly earnings before tips.
He gets paid ₣0.5 per collection. So, his earnings before tips are 2260 * 0.5 = ₣1130.

### Step 7: Calculate Oscar's tips.
He earns an additional 10% in tips. 10% of ₣1130 is 0.10 * 1130 = ₣113.

### Step 8: Calculate Oscar's total weekly earnings.
Adding his earnings before tips and his tips, we get 1130 + 113 = ₣1243.

The final answer is: ₣1243",1243.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many apartments are in each complex. 
The first 2 complexes have 100 apartments each.
So, the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes is 100 + 100 = 200.
The last complex is 35% bigger than the other 2 combined, which means it has 200 + (35/100)*200 = 200 + 70 = 270 apartments.
However, this week, 9 apartments from each of the first 2 complexes were vacant, so the number of apartments that required collection service from the first 2 complexes is (100 - 9) + (100 - 9) = 91 + 91 = 182.
The total number of apartments that required collection service is 182 + 270 = 452.
Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 452 * 5 = 2260.
He gets paid ₣0.5 per collection for each apartment, so his total earnings from collections per week is 2260 * 0.5 = ₣1130.
He also earns an additional 10% in tips, which means he earns 1130 * (10/100) = ₣113 in tips.

How much would a 60-minute call cost?",24.0,"To calculate the cost of a 60-minute call, we need to break it down into parts based on the pricing structure provided.

1. **First 10 minutes**: The cost is ₺0.8 per minute.
   - Cost = 10 minutes * ₺0.8/minute = ₺8

2. **Next 30 minutes (from 11th minute to 40th minute)**: The cost drops to ₺0.7 per minute.
   - Cost = 30 minutes * ₺0.7/minute = ₺21

3. **Last 20 minutes (from 41st minute to 60th minute)**: The cost drops to ₺0.1 per two minutes.
   - Since the rate is per two minutes, we divide the 20 minutes by 2 to get 10 units of 2 minutes each.
   - Cost = 10 units * ₺0.1/unit = ₺1

Now, let's add up the costs for each part of the call:
- Total cost = ₺8 (first 10 minutes) + ₺21 (next 30 minutes) + ₺1 (last 20 minutes) = ₺30

Since the total bill (₺30) is more than ₺25, you get a 20% discount on your total bill.
- Discount = 20% of ₺30 = 0.20 * ₺30 = ₺6

So, the cost for the next 30 minutes is 30 * 0.7 = ₺21.
After 40 minutes, the price drops to ₺0.1 per two minutes, which is ₺0.05 per minute.
For the remaining 20 minutes (60 - 40 = 20 minutes), the cost is 20 * 0.05 = ₺1.
The total cost before discount is 8 + 21 + 1 = ₺30.
Since the total bill is more than ₺25, a 20% discount is applied.

The janitor works 8 hours a day for 10 days. So, the total time available is 8 * 10 = 80 hours.

## Step 5: Calculate the time spent cleaning per day on average
The total time needed to clean all rooms is 40 hours. Since the janitor has 10 days (or 80 hours) to do this, we need to find out how much time per day is spent cleaning on average. This is simply the total time needed divided by the number of days, which is 40 / 10 = 4 hours per day.
