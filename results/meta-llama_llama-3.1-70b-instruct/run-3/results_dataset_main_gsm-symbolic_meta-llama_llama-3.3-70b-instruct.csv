But as I pour it, I spill 5 liters of the peach drink. How much water is in the remaining 31 liters?",7.0,"To find the amount of water in the remaining 31 liters, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the amount of water in the peach drink:
You have 20 liters of peach drink that is 1/5 water. 
Water in peach drink = 20 liters * (1/5) = 20 * 0.2 = 4 liters

2. Calculate the amount of water in the lemon drink:
You have 16 liters of lemon drink that is 1/4 water.
Water in lemon drink = 16 liters * (1/4) = 16 * 0.25 = 4 liters

3. Since you spill 5 liters of the peach drink, you need to calculate the amount of water spilled:
The spilled peach drink is also 1/5 water.
Water spilled = 5 liters * (1/5) = 5 * 0.2 = 1 liter

4. Calculate the remaining amount of peach drink and the water in it:
Remaining peach drink = 20 - 5 = 15 liters
Water in remaining peach drink = 15 liters * (1/5) = 15 * 0.2 = 3 liters

5. Calculate the total amount of water in the remaining 31 liters (15 liters of peach drink + 16 liters of lemon drink):
Total water = Water in remaining peach drink + Water in lemon drink
Total water = 3 liters + 4 liters
Total water = 7 liters

So, there are 7 liters of water in the remaining 31 liters.",31.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how much water is in the 20 liters of peach drink. Since it's 1/5 water, the amount of water in the peach drink is 20 * (1/5) = 4 liters.
Next, we need to find out how much water is in the 16 liters of lemon drink. Since it's 1/4 water, the amount of water in the lemon drink is 16 * (1/4) = 4 liters.
Now, we spill 5 liters of the peach drink. Since the peach drink is 1/5 water, the amount of water spilled is 5 * (1/5) = 1 liter.
So, the amount of water left in the peach drink is 4 - 1 = 3 liters.
The total amount of water in the remaining drinks is the water left in the peach drink (after spilling) plus the water in the lemon drink, which is 3 + 4 = 7 liters.
The total volume of the drink after spilling 5 liters of peach drink is 20 - 5 + 16 = 31 liters.

If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 6 hours if she spends 2/4 of the time running and three-sixths of the time walking?",36.0,"To solve this problem, we first need to find Jasmine's running and walking speeds.

Given that she can skip at 6 miles per hour and her skipping speed is 3/5 as fast as her running speed, we can set up the equation:

Skipping speed = (3/5) * Running speed
6 = (3/5) * Running speed

To find her running speed, we multiply both sides by 5/3:

Running speed = 6 * (5/3)
Running speed = 10 miles per hour

Since Jasmine can run five times faster than she can walk, we can set up the equation:

Running speed = 5 * Walking speed
10 = 5 * Walking speed

To find her walking speed, we divide both sides by 5:

Walking speed = 10 / 5
Walking speed = 2 miles per hour

Now, we know her running and walking speeds. We are given that she spends 2/4 of the time running and 3/6 of the time walking. We can simplify these fractions:

2/4 = 1/2
3/6 = 1/2

So, she spends 1/2 of the time running and 1/2 of the time walking.

Since the total time is 6 hours, the time spent running and walking is:

Time running = 1/2 * 6 = 3 hours
Time walking = 1/2 * 6 = 3 hours

Now, we can find the distance traveled while running and walking:

Distance running = Running speed * Time running
= 10 * 3
= 30 miles

Distance walking = Walking speed * Time walking
= 2 * 3
= 6 miles

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances traveled while running and walking:

Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking
= 30 + 6
= 36 miles

So, Jasmine can travel 36 miles in 6 hours.",6.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
Jasmine can skip at 6 miles per hour.
She can run at a speed that is 5/3 times as fast as she can skip, since she can skip at 3/5 as fast as she can run.
So, her running speed is 6 * (5/3) = 10 miles per hour.
She can walk at a speed that is 1/5 as fast as she can run, since she can run 5 times faster than she can walk.
So, her walking speed is 10 * (1/5) = 2 miles per hour.
Jasmine spends 2/4 of the time running, which is the same as 1/2 of the time.
She spends 3/6 of the time walking, which is the same as 1/2 of the time.
Since 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, she spends the entire time either running or walking, with no time left over for skipping.
The total time is 6 hours.
The time spent running is 6 * (1/2) = 3 hours.
The time spent walking is 6 * (1/2) = 3 hours.
The distance traveled while running is 10 * 3 = 30 miles.
The distance traveled while walking is 2 * 3 = 6 miles.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,25.0,"## Step 1: Determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die.
To find this probability, we first identify the favorable outcomes, which are rolling 4, 5, or 6. Since there are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a die, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2.

## Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
The probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die is 3/6 (since there are 3 even numbers: 2, 4, 6), which simplifies to 1/2. To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we multiply the probability of the first event by the probability of the second event: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

## Step 3: Find the difference in probability between the two events.
To find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we subtract the probability of the second event from the probability of the first event: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

## Step 4: Express the difference in probability as a percentage.
To convert the difference in probability (1/4) into a percentage, we divide 1 by 4 and then multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we first need to calculate the probability of each event.
1. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die:
There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6, which gives us 3 favorable outcomes.
So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5.
To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.5 * 100 = 50%.

2. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
First, we determine the probability of rolling an even number on a single roll.
The even numbers on a die are 2, 4, and 6, giving us 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
So, the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5.
Since we are rolling the die twice and each roll is independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25.
To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

3. Calculating how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row:
The difference in probability is 50% - 25% = 25%.
Therefore, it is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The problem states that Haruka found four-sixths as many caterpillars as ladybugs. This means the ratio of caterpillars to ladybugs is 4:6, which simplifies to 2:3.

## Step 2: Calculate the number of caterpillars based on the given number of ladybugs.
Given that there are 69 ladybugs, we can calculate the number of caterpillars using the ratio found in step 1. Since the ratio of caterpillars to ladybugs is 2:3, for every 3 ladybugs, there are 2 caterpillars. To find the number of caterpillars, we first determine the multiplier used to get from 3 (the ratio part for ladybugs) to 69 (the actual number of ladybugs). This multiplier is 69 / 3 = 23. Then, we multiply this multiplier by the ratio part for caterpillars, which is 2. So, the number of caterpillars is 2 * 23 = 46.

## Step 3: Calculate the total number of insects in the plot.
To find the total number of insects, we add the number of ladybugs to the number of caterpillars. total_insects = number_of_ladybugs + number_of_caterpillars = 69 + 46.

9 (initial pen pals) - 3 (pen pals he stopped being friends with) = 6

Each pen pal sends 4 letters a week, and Umar responds in kind, so he writes 4 letters a week to each of the 6 pen pals. Since each letter is 10 pages long, the total number of pages Umar writes per week is:
6 (pen pals) * 4 (letters/week) * 10 (pages/letter) = 240 pages/week

How many engineers are left if 26 artists stayed at the conference?",66.0,"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

## Step 1: Calculate the total number of people at the beginning of the conference.
At the beginning, there were 64 artists and 51 engineers. So, the total number of people is 64 + 51 = 115.

## Step 2: Determine the total number of people who left after half an hour.
One-fifth of the total number of people left. So, the number of people who left is (1/5) * 115 = 23.

## Step 3: Calculate the total number of people who stayed at the conference.
If 23 people left, then the number of people who stayed is 115 - 23 = 92.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of artists who left.
Since 26 artists stayed, the number of artists who left is 64 - 26 = 38.

## Step 5: Calculate the number of engineers who left.
We know that a total of 23 people left, and 38 artists left. However, this seems to be a mistake in calculation because if 38 artists left, it would exceed the total number of people who left, which is 23. Let's correct this by understanding that the number of artists who stayed (26) and the total number of people who stayed (92) can help us find out how many engineers stayed, without directly calculating the number of engineers who left from the incorrect number of artists who left.

## Step 6: Correctly calculate the number of engineers who stayed.
Since 26 artists stayed and the total number of people who stayed is 92, the number of engineers who stayed can be found by subtracting the number of artists who stayed from the total number of people who stayed. So, the number of engineers who stayed is 92 - 26 = 66.

However, this calculation seems incorrect because it would imply that more engineers stayed than were initially present. Let's correct the approach by directly addressing the error in the thought process.

## Step 7: Correct the approach by finding the number of engineers who stayed based on the correct understanding of people who left.
Given that 23 people left in total, and we need to find out how many engineers are left knowing that 26 artists stayed, we should first correctly establish the number of artists who left and then deduce the number of engineers who left based on the total number of people who left.

## Step 8: Correctly calculate the number of artists who left and then find the number of engineers who left.
If 26 artists stayed, then 64 - 26 = 38 artists left. However, this contradicts our total of 23 people leaving, indicating a miscalculation in the steps. The correct approach should involve understanding that if 26 artists stayed, then the number of artists who left is indeed 38, which was a point of confusion. The confusion arose from misinterpreting how many people left in total and not correctly applying it to find the engineers.

## Step 9: Re-evaluate the calculation for the number of engineers who stayed.
Given that 23 people left and we know 26 artists stayed (meaning 38 artists left), we see an error in logic since 38 exceeds the total number who could have left if only 23 people left in total. The correct logic should focus on the total number of people who stayed and the proportion of artists to engineers.

## Step 10: Correctly apply the information about the total number of people and the number of artists who stayed to find the number of engineers who stayed.
Since we have 26 artists staying and a total of 92 people staying, the error was in calculating the number of artists who left and not properly using the total number of people who left to find the engineers. We need to correctly find how many engineers stayed by using the total number of people who stayed and the number of artists who stayed.

The total cost per person is $6 (laser tag) + $6 (pinball tokens) + $88 (roller coaster) = $100.
Since Sofia will also be participating, we need to consider her costs as well. 
Let's denote the number of friends Sofia can invite as 'x'. 
The total cost for Sofia and her friends would be $100 * (x + 1), since Sofia is also participating.
This total cost must be less than or equal to the budget of $200.
So, $100 * (x + 1) ≤ $200.

The problem provides the area of a rectangular room and the length of the room. We need to find the perimeter of the room. The formula for the area of a rectangle is length times width (A = lw), and the formula for the perimeter is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width (P = 2l + 2w).

## Step 2: Use the given area and length to find the width of the room
Given that the area (A) is 660 square meters and the length (l) is 5 meters, we can use the area formula A = lw to find the width (w). So, 660 = 5w.

How many tubes of paint does Noah have?",42.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that DeShawn has 6 tubes of turquoise paint and 5 tubes of indigo paint.

Next, we are told that Noah has 1/3 as many tubes of turquoise paint as DeShawn. To find out how many tubes of turquoise paint Noah has, we can multiply DeShawn's number of tubes by 1/3:

6 tubes (DeShawn's turquoise paint) x 1/3 = 6 x 1/3 = 2 tubes

So, Noah has 2 tubes of turquoise paint.

We are also told that Noah has eight times as many tubes of indigo paint as DeShawn. To find out how many tubes of indigo paint Noah has, we can multiply DeShawn's number of tubes by 8:

5 tubes (DeShawn's indigo paint) x 8 = 5 x 8 = 40 tubes

So, Noah has 40 tubes of indigo paint.

Finally, to find out how many tubes of paint Noah has in total, we can add the number of tubes of turquoise paint and indigo paint:

2 tubes (turquoise) + 40 tubes (indigo) = 42 tubes

Lastly, we'll find the difference in time between the two conditions for swimming 8 miles.

1. **Cold Water Condition:**
   - Time to swim 1 mile = 16 minutes
   - Time to swim 8 miles = 16 minutes/mile * 8 miles = 128 minutes

2. **Warm Water Condition:**
   - It's stated that Tariq swims a mile in 6 minutes more than thrice as long as he does in cold water.
   - Thrice the time in cold water = 3 * 16 minutes = 48 minutes

   - Time to swim 1 mile in warm water = 54 minutes
   - Time to swim 8 miles = 54 minutes/mile * 8 miles = 432 minutes

3. **Difference in Time for Swimming 8 Miles:**
   - Time in warm water - Time in cold water = 432 minutes - 128 minutes = 304 minutes

3. Students who like to play hurling: 28
4. The rest like to either dance or paint.
5. The number of students who like to paint is twice the number of students who prefer playing hurling.

First, calculate the number of students who like to paint:
Since the number who like to paint is twice the number who like to play hurling, and 28 students like to play hurling:
Number who like to paint = 2 * Number who like to play hurling
Number who like to paint = 2 * 28
Number who like to paint = 56

- Video games: 14
- Hurling: 28
- Painting: 56
Total accounted for so far = 14 + 28 + 56 = 98

The number of students who like to dance can be found by subtracting the total number of students accounted for from the total number of students:
Number who like to dance = Total number of students - Total accounted for so far
Number who like to dance = 116 - 98

5. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms after 2 weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the initial number of occupied rooms.
The care facility has a capacity of 1900 rooms with 2/5 occupied. To find the number of occupied rooms, we multiply the capacity by 2/5.
Occupied rooms = 1900 * (2/5) = 760

Step 2: Calculate the initial number of unoccupied rooms.
The initial number of unoccupied rooms is the capacity minus the occupied rooms.
Unoccupied rooms = 1900 - 760 = 1140

Step 3: Calculate the total number of patients admitted after 2 weeks.
The care facility admits 80 patients per day. There are 7 days in a week, so in 2 weeks, there are 14 days.
Total patients admitted = 80 * 14 = 1120

Step 5: Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms after 2 weeks.

   Total space taken up by each plant and the gap after it = 18 feet.
   To find out how many 18-foot sections fit into 180 feet, we divide 180 by 18:
   180 / 18 = 10.

   This means Kimia can fit 10 plants in her flower bed, considering the 15-foot gap between each plant and not accounting for any gap at the end.

3. Calculate the number of plants Kimia needs to buy:
   Kimia already owns 11 flowers, but she can only fit 10 in her flower bed. Since she can't fit more than 10, we consider that she needs 0 more plants because she already has more than she can use.

4. Calculate the cost of the plants Kimia needs to buy:
   Since Kimia already has more plants than she needs (11 owned vs 10 spaces), she won't need to buy any more plants. Therefore, the cost will be 0.

So, Kimia won't spend any money at the store to fill up her flower bed because she already owns enough plants.",0.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
Kimia has a flower bed that is 180 feet long.
Each plant takes up 3 feet (its width) and she needs to leave 15 feet between every plant. 
So, the total space each plant and the gap after it takes up is 3 + 15 = 18 feet.
However, for the last plant, there won't be a need for the 15-foot gap after it, since it's the last one.
To find out how many plants can fit, we first need to see how many 18-foot sections can fit into 180 feet, which would be 180 / 18 = 10.
But since the last plant doesn't require the extra 15-foot gap, we can actually fit one more plant at the very end.
So, the total number of plants that can fit is 10 (from the full sections) + 1 (the extra plant at the end) = 11.
However, Kimia already owns 11 flowers, which means she doesn't need to buy any more to fill the bed.
Since she doesn't need to buy any more flowers, she won't spend any money at the store.
The answer is 0.",0.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
Kimia has a flower bed that is 180 feet long.
Each plant takes up 3 feet (for the plant itself) and requires an additional 15 feet of space between plants, so each plant effectively occupies 3 + 15 = 18 feet of space.
To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length by the space each plant occupies: 180 / 18 = 10.
Since Kimia already owns 11 flowers, but only 10 can fit in the flower bed, she actually doesn't need to buy any more flowers to fill the bed, because she already has more than enough.
However, considering the context of the question implies she wants to fill the bed with the flowers she has and potentially buy more if needed, but since she can't fit more than 10 and she already has 11, the question's premise might be slightly misunderstood. Given she can only fit 10 and she has 11, she doesn't need to buy any.
So, the amount of money Kimia will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, given she already has enough flowers and doesn't need to buy more, is 0.

How long will it take her to peel and saute 90 clams?,30.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Fatima to peel and saute 90 clams separately and then combine them.

1. Time to peel 90 clams:
Fatima can peel 10 clams a minute. To find the time it takes to peel 90 clams, we divide the total number of clams by the number of clams she can peel per minute:
90 clams / 10 clams/minute = 9 minutes

2. Time to saute 90 clams:
Fatima can saute 30 clams in 7 minutes. To find the time it takes to saute 90 clams, we first find out how many sets of 30 clams are in 90 clams:
90 clams / 30 clams = 3 sets

Since it takes 7 minutes to saute one set of 30 clams, we multiply the time it takes to saute one set by the number of sets:
3 sets * 7 minutes/set = 21 minutes

3. Total time to peel and saute 90 clams:
Since peeling and sauteing are sequential tasks (she can't saute until the clams are peeled), we add the time it takes to peel the clams to the time it takes to saute them:
9 minutes (peeling) + 21 minutes (sauteing) = 30 minutes

Therefore, it will take Fatima 30 minutes to peel and saute 90 clams.",90.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many clams Fatima can peel in a certain amount of time and how many she can saute in that same amount of time. 
Fatima can peel 10 clams per minute.
To find out how long it takes her to peel 90 clams, we divide the total number of clams by the number she can peel per minute: 90 / 10 = 9 minutes.
Now, let's calculate how many clams she can saute per minute: 30 clams / 7 minutes = 30 / 7 = approximately 4.29 clams per minute.
To find out how long it takes her to saute 90 clams, we divide the total number of clams by the number she can saute per minute: 90 / 4.29 = approximately 21 minutes.
However, since peeling and sauteing are two separate tasks, we should consider them sequentially. 
First, it takes her 9 minutes to peel 90 clams.

On Saturday and Sunday, he spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes as extra learning time. Three-sixths of 1260 minutes is (3/6) * 1260 = 630 minutes.
Since he spends this amount on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time is 630 * 2 = 1260 minutes.

First, we need to calculate Emma's speed on the beach. We know she walks 11 miles on the beach and it takes her 66 minutes. To find her speed, we use the formula speed = distance / time. So, her speed on the beach is 11 miles / 66 minutes = 1/6 miles per minute.

## Step 2: Calculate Emma's speed on the sidewalk
We are told that Emma walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Since her speed on the beach is 1/6 miles per minute, her speed on the sidewalk is 4 * (1/6) = 2/3 miles per minute.

## Step 3: Calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk
Emma walks 16 miles on the sidewalk. Using the formula time = distance / speed, we can find the time she spends walking on the sidewalk. So, the time spent on the sidewalk is 16 miles / (2/3 miles per minute) = 16 * (3/2) = 24 minutes.

## Step 4: Calculate the total time for the entire walk
To find the total time for the entire 27-mile walk, we add the time spent walking on the beach to the time spent walking on the sidewalk. The total time is 66 minutes (beach) + 24 minutes (sidewalk) = 90 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$",90.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
Emma walks a total of 27 miles every day.
Her walk includes 11 miles on the beach and 16 miles on the sidewalk.
We know she spends 66 minutes walking on the beach.
First, we need to find her speed on the beach. Since speed = distance / time, we can find her speed on the beach by dividing the distance she walks on the beach (11 miles) by the time she spends walking on the beach (66 minutes).
However, to make the units consistent, we should convert the time into hours because speed is typically measured in miles per hour (mph). 66 minutes is 66 / 60 = 1.1 hours.
So, her speed on the beach is 11 miles / 1.1 hours = 10 mph.
We are told that on the sidewalk, Emma walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is 4 * 10 mph = 40 mph.
Now, we can find the time it takes for her to walk on the sidewalk. Since speed = distance / time, time = distance / speed. The distance on the sidewalk is 16 miles, and her speed on the sidewalk is 40 mph.
So, the time spent walking on the sidewalk is 16 miles / 40 mph = 0.4 hours.
To convert this into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes), which gives us 0.4 * 60 = 24 minutes.
The total time for her walk is the sum of the time spent walking on the beach and the time spent walking on the sidewalk, which is 66 minutes + 24 minutes = 90 minutes.

## Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs Winnie eats in the first 60 days.
Winnie eats 4 eggs a day for 60 days. So, the total number of eggs in the first 60 days is 4 eggs/day * 60 days = 240 eggs.

## Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs Winnie eats in the next 96 days.
Winnie increases her egg consumption to 5 eggs a day for 96 days. So, the total number of eggs in the next 96 days is 5 eggs/day * 96 days = 480 eggs.

The total number of eggs Winnie needs is the sum of the eggs she eats in the two periods: 240 eggs + 480 eggs = 720 eggs.

## Step 4: Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

The kernels increase to 4 times the initial popping rate in the next 22 seconds, but in the final 22 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 22 seconds. After Oscar takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Oscar have to eat?",285.0,"To find the total number of pieces of popcorn Oscar has to eat, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 22-second interval and then add them up. 

In the first 22 seconds, 30 kernels popped.

In the next 22 seconds, the number of kernels that popped is 2 times the initial amount, which is 2 * 30 = 60 kernels.

In the next 22 seconds, the kernels increase to 4 times the initial popping rate, so 4 * 30 = 120 kernels popped.

In the final 22 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 22 seconds. Since the past 22 seconds had 120 kernels popping, half of that rate would be 120 / 2 = 60 kernels.

Now, let's add up the kernels that popped in each interval: 30 + 60 + 120 + 60 = 270 kernels.

After Oscar takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. Since 60 kernels popped in the final 22 seconds, a quarter of that would be 60 / 4 = 15 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels that popped is 270 (from the cooking) + 15 (from the residual heat) = 285 kernels.

Therefore, Oscar has 285 pieces of popcorn to eat.",285.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
In the first 22 seconds, 30 kernels pop.
In the next 22 seconds, the kernels pop at 2 times the initial rate, so 2 * 30 = 60 kernels pop.
In the next 22 seconds, the kernels pop at 4 times the initial rate, so 4 * 30 = 120 kernels pop.
In the final 22 seconds of cooking, the popping slows down to half the rate of the past 22 seconds, which was 120 kernels. So, half of 120 is 120 / 2 = 60 kernels.
The total number of kernels that popped while cooking is 30 + 60 + 120 + 60 = 270 kernels.
After Oscar takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. A quarter of 60 is 60 / 4 = 15 kernels.
So, the total number of kernels that popped, including those from residual heat, is 270 + 15 = 285 kernels.
The answer is 285.",285.0,1,,285.0,1

If there are 30 tiles in the stack in total, how many green tiles are there?",18.0,"To find the number of green tiles, let's first calculate the total number of purple and pink tiles.

There are 4 purple tiles. 
The number of pink tiles is twice the number of purple tiles, so there are 2 * 4 = 8 pink tiles.

Now, we know that there are 4 purple tiles and 8 pink tiles, so the total number of purple and pink tiles is:
4 (purple) + 8 (pink) = 12 tiles.

We are told that there are 30 tiles in total. To find the number of green tiles, we need to subtract the total number of purple and pink tiles from the total number of tiles:
30 (total tiles) - 12 (purple and pink tiles) = 18 tiles.

So, there are 18 green tiles in the stack.",18.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
The stack contains 4 purple tiles.
It also contains twice as many pink tiles as purple tiles, so the number of pink tiles is 2 * 4 = 8.
The total number of purple and pink tiles is 4 + 8 = 12.
Since there are 30 tiles in the stack in total, the number of green tiles is 30 - 12 = 18.

He also has his 2 young children who weigh 75 pounds each in it. If the force to move the car is 4% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the car?",92.0,"To find the total weight of the car, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car: 1700 pounds
Weight of the luggage: 450 pounds
Weight of the children: 2 x 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = Weight of the car + Weight of the luggage + Weight of the children
Total weight = 1700 + 450 + 150
Total weight = 2300 pounds

The force to move the car is 4% of the total weight. To find 4% of the total weight, we multiply the total weight by 0.04.

Force = 0.04 x Total weight
Force = 0.04 x 2300
Force = 92 pounds

So, Pavel needs to push the car with a force of 92 pounds.",92.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
The car itself weighs 1700 pounds.
