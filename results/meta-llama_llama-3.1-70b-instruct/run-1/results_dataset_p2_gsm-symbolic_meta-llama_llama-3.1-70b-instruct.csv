gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"Sophia went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, and 60 mini cheesecakes. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of donuts**

Sophia bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen. To find the cost of 60 donuts, we need to divide 60 by 12 (since there are 12 donuts in a dozen) and multiply by the cost per dozen.

60 donuts ÷ 12 = 5 dozen
Cost of donuts = 5 dozen × $19 per dozen = $95

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of mini cupcakes**

Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen. To find the cost of 60 mini cupcakes, we need to divide 60 by 12 (since there are 12 cupcakes in a dozen) and multiply by the cost per dozen.

60 cupcakes ÷ 12 = 5 dozen
Cost of cupcakes = 5 dozen × $33 per dozen = $165

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of donuts and cupcakes**

Total cost of donuts and cupcakes = $95 + $165 = $260

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of all pastries before discount**

Sophia paid a total of $1500 after a 20% discount. To find the total cost before discount, we need to divide $1500 by 0.8 (since 20% discount means 80% of the original price).

Total cost before discount = $1500 ÷ 0.8 = $1875

**Step 5: Calculate the cost of mini cheesecakes**

Now, we can find the cost of mini cheesecakes by subtracting the total cost of donuts and cupcakes from the total cost before discount.

Cost of mini cheesecakes = Total cost before discount - Total cost of donuts and cupcakes
= $1875 - $260
= $1615

Since Sophia bought 60 mini cheesecakes, we can divide the cost by 5 (since there are 12 cheesecakes in a dozen, and 60 ÷ 12 = 5 dozen).

Cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen = $1615 ÷ 5 = $323 per dozen

Therefore, the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is $323.",323.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes before the discount.

60 donuts at $19 per dozen means 60 / 12 = 5 dozen donuts.
The cost of donuts is 5 * $19 = $95.

60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen means 60 / 12 = 5 dozen mini cupcakes.
The cost of mini cupcakes is 5 * $33 = $165.

The total cost of donuts and mini cupcakes is $95 + $165 = $260.

Since Sophia paid a total of $1500 after a 20% discount, the original total cost before the discount was $1500 / 0.8 = $1875.

The cost of mini cheesecakes is the difference between the original total cost and the cost of donuts and mini cupcakes, which is $1875 - $260 = $1615.

Since Sophia bought 60 mini cheesecakes, the number of dozen mini cheesecakes is 60 / 12 = 5 dozen.

The cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is $1615 / 5 = $323.

The answer is $323.",323.0,1,,323.0,1
gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving. A 300 grams bag has 6 servings. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?",350.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Hiroshi and Tara, and then determine how many calories they have already consumed and burned. We can then calculate how many calories they can still consume, and finally, how many grams of popcorn they can eat.

**Step 1: Calculate daily calorie target**

Hiroshi's daily calorie target = 15 calories/lb x 220 lbs = 3300 calories
Tara's daily calorie target = 15 calories/lb x 140 lbs = 2100 calories

**Step 2: Calculate net calories consumed**

Hiroshi's net calories consumed = 1100 calories (consumed) - 200 calories (burned) = 900 calories
Tara's net calories consumed = 900 calories (consumed) + 200 calories (ice cream) = 1100 calories

**Step 3: Calculate remaining calories**

Hiroshi's remaining calories = 3300 calories (target) - 900 calories (net consumed) = 2400 calories
Tara's remaining calories = 2100 calories (target) - 1100 calories (net consumed) = 1000 calories

**Step 4: Calculate calories from popcorn**

Since each serving of popcorn has 200 calories, and there are 6 servings in a 300g bag, we can calculate the calories per gram of popcorn:

Calories per gram of popcorn = 200 calories/serving x 6 servings / 300g = 4 calories/g

**Step 5: Calculate grams of popcorn**

Hiroshi's grams of popcorn = 2400 calories / 4 calories/g = 600g
Tara's grams of popcorn = 1000 calories / 4 calories/g = 250g

**Step 6: Calculate difference in grams of popcorn**

Difference in grams of popcorn = Hiroshi's grams - Tara's grams = 600g - 250g = 350g

Therefore, Hiroshi needs to consume 350g more popcorn than Tara.",350.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories Hiroshi and Tara can consume per day. 
Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, so his daily calorie target is 220 * 15 = 3300 calories.
Tara weighs 140 lbs, so her daily calorie target is 140 * 15 = 2100 calories.

Next, we need to find out how many calories Hiroshi and Tara have already consumed.
Hiroshi has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise, so the net calories he has consumed is 1100 - 200 = 900 calories.
Tara has already consumed 900 calories in food and 200 calories in ice cream, so the total calories she has consumed is 900 + 200 = 1100 calories.

Now, we need to find out how many calories Hiroshi and Tara can still consume.
Hiroshi can still consume 3300 - 900 = 2400 calories.
Tara can still consume 2100 - 1100 = 1000 calories.

Since a serving of popcorn has 200 calories, we need to find out how many servings Hiroshi and Tara can still consume.
Hiroshi can still consume 2400 / 200 = 12 servings.
Tara can still consume 1000 / 200 = 5 servings.

Since a 300 grams bag has 6 servings, we need to find out how many grams of popcorn Hiroshi and Tara can still consume.
Hiroshi can still consume 12 servings, which is equivalent to (12 / 6) * 300 = 600 grams.
Tara can still consume 5 servings, which is equivalent to (5 / 6) * 300 = 250 grams.

Finally, we need to find out how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara.
Hiroshi needs to consume 600 - 250 = 350 grams more than Tara.

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"Daphne is an avid gardener. Two days ago, she received 23 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges of her large country home. She also purchased 200 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Daphne remain with?",335.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of potted plants Daphne already has**

Daphne has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges, so:

8 plants/ledge × 56 ledges = 8 × 56 = 448 plants

**Step 2: Add the new potted plants Daphne received two days ago**

Daphne received 23 new potted plants, so:

448 plants + 23 plants = 471 plants

**Step 3: Calculate the number of new potted plants Daphne purchased yesterday**

Daphne purchased 200 new plants at a 50% discount, but the discount doesn't affect the number of plants, so:

200 plants

**Step 4: Add the new potted plants Daphne purchased yesterday**

471 plants + 200 plants = 671 plants

**Step 5: Calculate the number of potted plants Daphne will give away tomorrow**

Daphne will give away 6 potted plants from each of the 56 window ledges, so:

6 plants/ledge × 56 ledges = 6 × 56 = 336 plants

**Step 6: Subtract the number of potted plants Daphne will give away from the total**

671 plants - 336 plants = 335 plants

Therefore, Daphne will remain with 335 potted plants.",335.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Daphne already has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges.
So, the total number of potted plants she already has is 8 * 56 = 448.

Two days ago, she received 23 new potted plants.
So, the total number of potted plants now is 448 + 23 = 471.

Yesterday, she purchased 200 new plants at a 50% discount.
Since the discount is 50%, she paid for half of the original price, but the number of plants remains the same.
So, the total number of potted plants now is 471 + 200 = 671.

Tomorrow, she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family.
Since there are 56 window ledges, she will give away a total of 6 * 56 = 336 potted plants.

So, the number of potted plants Daphne will remain with is 671 - 336 = 335.

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 60 minutes to cover every 4 miles of the city. However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the rate at which the fog bank covers the city initially.
The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, so its initial rate is:
4 miles / 60 minutes = 1/15 miles per minute

Step 2: Calculate the distance that needs to be covered to cover 1/4 of the city.
The city is 80 miles across, so 1/4 of the city is:
80 miles / 4 = 20 miles

Step 3: Calculate the time it would take to cover 20 miles at the initial rate.
Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 20 miles / (1/15 miles per minute)
Time = 20 miles * 15 minutes per mile
Time = 300 minutes

However, we know that the wind speed will be halved in one hour, which means the fog bank's rate will also be halved. Since we want to find the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, we need to consider the reduced rate.

Step 4: Calculate the reduced rate of the fog bank.
The initial rate is 1/15 miles per minute, so the reduced rate is:
1/2 * 1/15 miles per minute = 1/30 miles per minute

Step 5: Calculate the time it would take to cover 20 miles at the reduced rate.
Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 20 miles / (1/30 miles per minute)
Time = 20 miles * 30 minutes per mile
Time = 600 minutes

However, this is not the correct answer. The wind speed is halved after 1 hour, which means the fog bank will cover some distance at the initial rate before the wind speed is halved.

Step 6: Calculate the distance covered in the first hour at the initial rate.
Distance = Rate * Time
Distance = 1/15 miles per minute * 60 minutes
Distance = 4 miles

This means that the fog bank will cover 4 miles in the first hour, and then it will cover the remaining distance at the reduced rate.

Step 7: Calculate the remaining distance to be covered.
Remaining distance = 20 miles - 4 miles = 16 miles

Step 8: Calculate the time it would take to cover the remaining distance at the reduced rate.
Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 16 miles / (1/30 miles per minute)
Time = 16 miles * 30 minutes per mile
Time = 480 minutes

Finally, we add the initial 60 minutes to the time it takes to cover the remaining distance:
Total time = 60 minutes + 480 minutes = 540 minutes

However, we can simplify this problem by considering the fact that the fog bank covers 4 miles in the first hour, and then it covers the remaining distance at half the rate.

Step 9: Calculate the time it would take to cover the remaining distance at half the rate.
The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, so it covers 1 mile in:
60 minutes / 4 miles = 15 minutes per mile

At half the rate, it will cover 1 mile in:
15 minutes per mile * 2 = 30 minutes per mile

The remaining distance is 16 miles, so the time it would take to cover the remaining distance is:
16 miles * 30 minutes per mile = 480 minutes

Adding the initial 60 minutes, we get:
Total time = 60 minutes + 480 minutes = 540 minutes

However, we can simplify this further by considering the fact that the fog bank covers 1/4 of the city, which is 20 miles. The fog bank covers 4 miles in the first hour, and then it covers the remaining 16 miles at half the rate.

Step 10: Calculate the time it would take to cover the remaining 16 miles at half the rate.
The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, so it covers 16 miles in:
60 minutes * (16 miles / 4 miles) * 2 = 480 minutes

Adding the initial 60 minutes, we get:
Total time = 60 minutes + 480 minutes = 540 minutes

However, we can simplify this even further by considering the fact that the fog bank covers 1/4 of the city, which is 20 miles. The fog bank covers 4 miles in the first hour, and then it covers the remaining 16 miles at half the rate.

Since the fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, it will cover 20 miles in:
60 minutes * (20 miles / 4 miles) = 300 minutes

However, since the wind speed is halved after 1 hour, the fog bank will cover the remaining 16 miles at half the rate. This means that the time it would take to cover the remaining 16 miles is twice the time it would take to cover 16 miles at the initial rate.

The time it would take to cover 16 miles at the initial rate is:
60 minutes * (16 miles / 4 miles) = 240 minutes

Twice this time is:
240 minutes * 2 = 480 minutes

However, this is the time it would take to cover the remaining 16 miles after the wind speed is halved. We need to add the initial 60 minutes to get the total time.

Total time = 60 minutes + 480 minutes = 540 minutes

However, we can simplify this problem even further.

The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, so it covers 20 miles in:

Since the fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, it will cover 16 miles",16.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes.
We need to find out how many minutes it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, which is 1/4 of 80 miles.
1/4 of 80 miles is 80 / 4 = 20 miles.
Since the fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes it takes to cover 20 miles.
To do this, we can multiply the time it takes to cover 4 miles by 5, since 20 miles is 5 times 4 miles.
So, the time it takes to cover 20 miles is 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.
However, we are told that the wind speed will be halved in one hour, which means the fog bank will move at half the speed after one hour.
Since we are interested in the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, which is 20 miles, we need to consider the effect of the wind speed on the fog bank's movement.
But, since the wind speed is halved after one hour, and it takes 60 minutes to cover 4 miles, the wind speed will be halved after the fog bank has covered 4 miles.
So, for the remaining 16 miles (20 - 4 = 16), the fog bank will move at half the speed.
Since it takes 60 minutes to cover 4 miles at the original speed, it will take 120 minutes to cover 4 miles at half the speed.
To cover 16 miles at half the speed, it will take 120 * 4 = 480 minutes.
However, this is not the correct approach, as we need to consider the time it takes to cover the first 4 miles at the original speed, and then the remaining 16 miles at half the speed.
The correct approach is to add the time it takes to cover the first 4 miles at the original speed (60 minutes) to the time it takes to cover the remaining 16 miles at half the speed.
Since it takes 60 minutes to cover 4 miles at the original speed, it will take 120 minutes to cover 4 miles at half the speed.
To cover 16 miles at half the speed, it will take 120 * 4 = 480 minutes.

However, we can simplify this by considering",480.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes.
We need to find out how many minutes it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, which is 1/4 of 80 miles.
1/4 of 80 miles is 80 / 4 = 20 miles.
Since the fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes it takes to cover 20 miles.
To do this, we can divide 20 miles by 4 miles to get the number of times the fog bank needs to cover 4 miles to cover 20 miles.
20 miles / 4 miles = 5 times.
Since it takes 60 minutes to cover 4 miles, it will take 5 times 60 minutes to cover 20 miles.
However, we are told that the wind speed will be halved in one hour, which means the fog bank will move at half the speed after one hour.
Since we are looking for the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, which is 20 miles, and the fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, it will cover 20 miles in 5 times 60 minutes, which is 300 minutes.

On Thursday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. On Friday, he finished homework early and watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 2-hour episodes. On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?",6.0,"To find out how many 15-minute episodes Santiago watched on Thursday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV and subtract the time spent watching other shows.

Let's break down the time spent watching TV:

* Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 nights x 4 hours/night = 8 hours
* Friday: 3 hours + 45 minutes = 3.75 hours
* Saturday: 3 x 2 hours = 6 hours

Total time spent watching TV (excluding Thursday and Sunday): 8 + 3.75 + 6 = 17.75 hours

On Sunday, he watched three 15-minute episodes, which is a total of 0.75 hours (3 x 15 minutes / 60 minutes).

Now, let's subtract the total time spent watching TV (excluding Thursday) from the total time:

20 hours (total) - 17.75 hours (excluding Thursday) - 0.75 hours (Sunday) = 1.5 hours

Since Santiago watched 15-minute episodes on Thursday, we can convert the time to minutes:

1.5 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 90 minutes

Now, we can divide the time by 15 minutes to find the number of episodes:

90 minutes / 15 minutes/episode = 6 episodes

So, Santiago watched 6 episodes of the 15-minute show on Thursday.",15.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total hours of TV Santiago watched from Tuesday to Saturday:
On Tuesday and Wednesday, he watched 4 hours each night, so that's 4 + 4 = 8 hours.
On Friday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. We need to convert the 45 minutes to hours, which is 45 / 60 = 0.75 hours. So, on Friday, he watched 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.
On Saturday, he watched three 2-hour episodes, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours from Tuesday to Saturday: 8 + 3.75 + 6 = 17.75 hours.

We know that Santiago watched a total of 20 hours of TV, so the hours he watched on Thursday and Sunday are 20 - 17.75 = 2.25 hours.

On Sunday, he watched three 15-minute episodes, which is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes or 0.75 hours.

Now, let's subtract the hours he watched on Sunday from the total hours he watched on Thursday and Sunday: 2.25 - 0.75 = 1.5 hours.

Since we want to find out how many 15-minute episodes he watched on Thursday, we need to convert the 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.

Now, we can divide the total minutes by 15 to find the number of episodes: 90 / 15 = 6.

She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, and uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Nia uses teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 54:27. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both numbers by 9, which gives us a ratio of 6:3.

Let's say Nia uses 6x teaspoons of sugar and 3x cups of water. We also know that she uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, so she uses x cups of water, she uses x tablespoons of milk.

We also know that she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar, so she uses 2(6x) = 12x tablespoons of heavy cream.

The total amount of ingredients Nia uses is 240, so we can set up the equation:

6x + 3x + x + 12x = 240

Combine like terms:

22x = 240

Divide both sides by 22:

x = 240/22
x = 10.91 (round down to 10, since we can't have a fraction of a cup or teaspoon)

Now that we know x, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar Nia used:

6x = 6(10)

The total amount of ingredients Nia uses is 240, so we can set up the equation:

6x + 3x + 3x + 12x = 240

Combine like terms:

24x = 240

Nia uses teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 54:27. 
We can simplify this ratio by dividing both numbers by 9, which gives us 6:3.

She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, which means she uses 1 tablespoon of milk for every cup of water.

Additionally, she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar.

Let's say she uses x teaspoons of sugar. 
Then, she uses x cups of water (since the ratio of sugar to water is 6:3, and x is a multiple of 6).
She also uses x tablespoons of milk (since she uses 1 tablespoon of milk for every cup of water).
And she uses 2x tablespoons of heavy cream (since she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar).

We know that the total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is 240.

Let's denote the number of forks in the package Aisha bought as 'x'.

1. Aisha bought 'x' forks.
2. Her husband bought 8 forks, so the total number of forks now is x + 8.
3. Aisha used 16 forks to sample her stuffed peppers, so the total number of forks now is x + 8 - 16 = x - 8.
4. Aisha threw away 6 defective forks, so the total number of forks now is x - 8 - 6 = x - 14.

In the span of two years, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?",1764.0,"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bananas and apricots Ravi harvests in two years. 

First, let's calculate how many bananas Ravi harvests in two years. Since Ravi can harvest bananas every 4 months, and there are 12 months in a year, Ravi can harvest bananas 3 times per year.

We know that Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field. We are given that there are 36 bananas per 4/5 of a square yard. To find out how many bananas per square yard, we multiply 36 by 5/4.

36 * (5/4) = 45 bananas per square yard

Now, we multiply the number of bananas per square yard by the total number of square yards to find out the total number of bananas per harvest.

45 * 10 = 450 bananas per harvest

Since Ravi can harvest bananas 3 times per year, and there are 2 years, he harvests bananas 6 times.

450 * 6 = 2700 bananas in 2 years

Now let's calculate how many apricots Ravi harvests in two years. Ravi has a 13 square yard apricot field that produces 12 apricots per square yard. 

Since Ravi can harvest apricots every 4 months, he can harvest apricots 3 times per year.

We multiply the number of apricots per square yard by the total number of square yards to find out the total number of apricots per harvest.

12 * 13 = 156 apricots per harvest

Since Ravi can harvest apricots 3 times per year, and there are 2 years, he harvests apricots 6 times.

156 * 6 = 936 apricots in 2 years

Now, we need to find out how many more bananas Ravi harvests than apricots in two years. We subtract the total number of apricots from the total number of bananas.

2700 - 936 = 1764

So, Ravi harvests 1764 more bananas than apricots in two years.",1764.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many bananas Ravi can harvest per year. There are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard. Since four-fifths is the same as 4/5, we can calculate the number of bananas per square yard as follows:
36 bananas / (4/5) square yard = 36 / (4/5) bananas/square yard = 36 * (5/4) bananas/square yard = 45 bananas/square yard.

Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field, so the total number of bananas per harvest is:
10 square yards * 45 bananas/square yard = 450 bananas.

Since Ravi can harvest bananas every 4 months, he can have 3 harvests in a year. Therefore, the total number of bananas harvested per year is:
450 bananas/harvest * 3 harvests/year = 1350 bananas/year.

Now, let's calculate the number of apricots Ravi can harvest per year. Ravi owns a 13-square yard apricot field that produces 12 apricots per square yard. So, the total number of apricots per harvest is:
13 square yards * 12 apricots/square yard = 156 apricots.

Since apricots can be harvested every 4 months, Ravi can have 3 harvests in a year. Therefore, the total number of apricots harvested per year is:
156 apricots/harvest * 3 harvests/year = 468 apricots/year.

In the span of two years, the total number of bananas harvested is:
1350 bananas/year * 2 years = 2700 bananas.

The total number of apricots harvested in two years is:
468 apricots/year * 2 years = 936 apricots.

Arjun can either pay a one-time $20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases, or not become a member and receive only a 5% discount. What is the least amount Arjun can spend on everything?",212.0,"To find the least amount Arjun can spend on everything, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the discounts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the items**

* 12 folders x $4.75 = $57.00
* 8 erasers x $14.50 = $116.00
* 1 ream of bond paper = $11.00
* 7 pencils x $8.00 = $56.00

Total cost = $57.00 + $116.00 + $11.00 + $56.00 = $240.00

**Step 2: Calculate the cost with the 5% discount (no membership)**

Discount = 5% of $240.00 = 0.05 x $240.00 = $12.00
Cost with 5% discount = $240.00 - $12.00 = $228.00

**Step 3: Calculate the cost with the 20% discount (with membership)**

Membership fee = $20.00
Discount = 20% of $240.00 = 0.20 x $240.00 = $48.00
Cost with 20% discount = $240.00 - $48.00 = $192.00
Total cost with membership = $192.00 + $20.00 = $212.00

**Step 4: Compare the costs**

Cost with 5% discount = $228.00

1 ream of bond paper costs $11.00
7 pencils cost 7 * $8.00 = $56.00

The total cost of the items is $57.00 + $116.00 + $11.00 + $56.00 = $240.00

Now, let's calculate the discount if Arjun becomes a member:

20% discount on $240.00 is 0.20 * $240.00 = $48.00
So, the total cost with the 20% discount is $240.00 - $48.00 = $192.00
However, Arjun has to pay a one-time fee of $20.00 to become a member.
So, the total amount Arjun has to pay if he becomes a member is $192.00 + $20.00 = $212.00

Now, let's calculate the discount if Arjun does not become a member:

5% discount on $240.00 is 0.05 * $240.00 = $12.00
So, the total cost with the 5% discount is $240.00 - $12.00 = $228.00

Since $212.00 is less than $228.00, the least amount Arjun can spend on everything is $212.00.

There are 15 numbers greater than 5 on a 20-sided die (6-20). So the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a single roll is:

15/20 = 3/4

Now, we square this probability to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row:

(3/4)^2 = 9/16 = 0.5625

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.5625 * 100 = 56.25%

Now, let's find the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row. There are 10 even numbers on a 20-sided die (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20). So the probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:

0.0625 * 100 = 6.25%

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events: rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row, and rolling four even numbers in a row.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a twenty-sided die. There are 15 numbers greater than 5 (6-20), so the probability is 15/20 = 0.75 or 75%.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is the product of the probabilities of each roll: 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 or 56.25%.

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling an even number on a twenty-sided die. There are 10 even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20), so the probability is 10/20 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is the product of the probabilities of each roll: 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.0625 or 6.25%.

1. We know that there are 9 bees in the plot.
2. We also know that there are 2/3 as many beetles as bees. To find the number of beetles, we can multiply the number of bees by 2/3:

Beetles = (2/3) × 9 = 6

So, there are 6 beetles in the plot.

3. We know that Mia found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. To find the number of rabbits, we can divide the total number of white animals by 2:

So, the total number of animals in the plot is 9 (bees) + 6 (beetles) + 13 (rabbits) + 24 (wasps) = 52.

To calculate the percentage of animals that are rabbits, we need to divide the number of rabbits by the total number of animals and multiply by 100.

Mia found 9 bees in the plot.
She found 2/3 as many beetles as bees, so the number of beetles is 2/3 * 9 = 6.
She also found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits, so the number of rabbits is 26 / 2 = 13.
In addition, she saw 24 wasps.

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?",11000.0,"To find out how much more the total cost will be than Mrs. Lee's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the townhouse after the discount, brokerage fee, and transfer fee.

Step 1: Calculate the discounted selling price
Discount = 25% of $400,000 = 0.25 x $400,000 = $100,000
Discounted selling price = $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000

Step 2: Calculate the brokerage fee
Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000

Step 3: Calculate the transfer fee
Transfer fee = 12% of $400,000 = 0.12 x $400,000 = $48,000

Step 4: Calculate the total cost
Total cost = Discounted selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
= $300,000 + $20,000 + $48,000
= $368,000

Step 5: Calculate the difference between the total cost and Mrs. Lee's budget
Difference = Total cost - Budget
= $368,000 - $340,000
= $28,000

Therefore, the total cost will be $28,000 more than Mrs. Lee's budget.",28000.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

The selling price of the property is $400,000.
Mrs. Lee can get a 25% discount on the selling price.
So, the discount amount is 25% of $400,000 = 0.25 * $400,000 = $100,000.
The discounted price is $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.
The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 12% of $400,000 = 0.12 * $400,000 = $48,000.

The total cost is the discounted price + brokerage fee + transfer fee = $300,000 + $20,000 + $48,000 = $368,000.

Mrs. Lee's budget is $340,000.

She can get a 25% discount on the selling price, so the discount amount is 25% of $400,000 = 0.25 * $400,000 = $100,000.
The discounted price is $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000.

On top of the discounted price, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, so the brokerage fee is 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

The buyer also has to pay a transfer fee which is 12% of the selling price, so the transfer fee is 12% of $400,000 = 0.12 * $400,000 = $48,000.

The total cost is the discounted price plus the brokerage fee plus the transfer fee: $300,000 + $20,000 + $48,000 = $368,000.

To find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Lee's budget, we need to subtract her budget from the total cost: $368,000 - $340,000 = $28,000.

The stocks gained 10% each year for two years. How much were Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years?",80465.0,"To calculate Dr. Brown's net proceeds, we'll break down the problem into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the total fees paid by Dr. Brown.

Legal fees = 2% of the selling price
= 2% of $550,000
= 0.02 x $550,000
= $11,000

Realtor fee = 5% of the selling price
= 5% of $550,000
= 0.05 x $550,000
= $27,500

Total fees = Legal fees + Realtor fee
= $11,000 + $27,500
= $38,500

Step 2: Calculate the amount left after paying the fees.

Amount left = Selling price - Total fees
= $550,000 - $38,500
= $511,500

Step 3: Calculate the amount left after paying the remaining loan amount and closing costs.

Amount left = Amount left - Loan amount - Closing costs
= $511,500 - $440,000 - $5,000
= $66,500

Step 4: Calculate the amount gained from investing in stocks.

The stocks gained 10% each year for two years. To calculate the total gain, we'll multiply the amount by (1 + 0.10) for two years.

Amount after two years = Amount invested x (1 + 0.10)^2

How many marked balls are there in total?",16.0,"To find the total number of marked balls, we need to find the number of marked golf balls and marked tennis balls separately.

1. First, let's find the number of golf balls. Since 1/5 of the balls are golf balls, we can calculate it as follows:
   Total balls = 160
   Golf balls = 1/5 * 160
   Golf balls = 32

2. Now, we need to find the number of yellow golf balls. Since 1/2 of the golf balls are yellow:
   Yellow golf balls = 1/2 * 32
   Yellow golf balls = 16

3. Next, we need to find the number of marked yellow golf balls. Since 1/8 of the yellow golf balls are marked:
   Marked yellow golf balls = 1/8 * 16
   Marked yellow golf balls = 2

4. Now, let's find the number of tennis balls. Since the rest of the balls are tennis balls:
   Tennis balls = Total balls - Golf balls
   Tennis balls = 160 - 32
   Tennis balls = 128

5. Next, we need to find the number of indigo tennis balls. Since 1/8 of the tennis balls are indigo:
   Indigo tennis balls = 1/8 * 128
   Indigo tennis balls = 16

6. Now, we need to find the number of marked indigo tennis balls. Since all except 1/8 of the indigo tennis balls are marked:

   - Then, calculate the cost of the next 4 kgs at 1/4 off: 4 kgs * ₺22 per kg = ₺88. Since it's 1/4 off, the discount is ₺88 * 1/4 = ₺22. So, the cost of the next 4 kgs is ₺88 - ₺22 = ₺66.
   - Finally, calculate the cost of the remaining 2 kgs (21 - 15 - 4 = 2) at the regular price: 2 kgs * ₺22 per kg = ₺44.

Now, let's calculate the total length of the remoras:
6 remoras × 8 inches/remora = 48 inches

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras:
(48 inches ÷ 120 inches) × 100% ≈ 40%

**Average percentage**

To find the average percentage, we can add the percentages for both sharks and divide by 2:
(50% + 40%) ÷ 2 = 90% ÷ 2 = 45%

So, on average, approximately 45% of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras.",45.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the total length of the remoras attached to the first shark. 
There are 18 remoras, each 16 inches long.
So, the total length of the remoras is 18 * 16 = 288 inches.

Since 1/6 of the remoras swam away, we need to find 1/6 of 18.
1/6 of 18 is 3, so 3 remoras swam away.
Now, there are 18 - 3 = 15 remoras left.
The total length of the remoras left is 15 * 16 = 240 inches.

We need to convert the length of the shark from feet to inches. 
1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so 40 feet is equal to 40 * 12 = 480 inches.

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras.
The percentage is (240 / 480) * 100 = 50%.

Next, we need to find the total length of the remoras attached to the second shark.
There are 6 remoras, each 8 inches long.
So, the total length of the remoras is 6 * 8 = 48 inches.

We need to convert the length of the shark from feet to inches. 
1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so 10 feet is equal to 10 * 12 = 120 inches.

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras.
The percentage is (48 / 120) * 100 = 40%.

Finally, we need to find the average percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras.
The average percentage is (50 + 40) / 2 = 45%.

How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?",14.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total capacity of the tables and bowls**

Each bowl can hold 24 almonds, and each table can hold three times that, which is 3 x 24 = 72 almonds.

Carlos has 7 bowls, so the total capacity of the bowls is 7 x 24 = 168 almonds.

Initially, Carlos has 3 tables, so the total capacity of the tables is 3 x 72 = 216 almonds.

**Step 2: Calculate the total capacity after 2 tables break**

After 2 tables break, Carlos is left with 1 table, which can hold 72 almonds.

The total capacity of the bowls and tables is now 168 (bowls) + 72 (table) = 240 almonds.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of almonds after Carlos eats one-fifth**

Carlos has 720 almonds initially and eats one-fifth of them, which is 720 x (1/5) = 144 almonds.

So, Carlos is left with 720 - 144 = 576 almonds.

**Step 4: Calculate the number of bowls needed to hold the remaining almonds**

The total capacity of the bowls and tables is 240 almonds, but Carlos has 576 almonds left.

To find out how many more bowls Carlos needs, we subtract the total capacity from the number of almonds left: 576 - 240 = 336 almonds.

Since each bowl can hold 24 almonds, we divide the remaining almonds by 24 to find out how many more bowls Carlos needs: 336 ÷ 24 = 14 bowls.

However, Carlos already has 7 bowls, so we subtract 7 from 14 to find out how many more bowls he needs: 14 - 7 = 7 bowls.

Therefore, Carlos needs 7 more bowls to place all the remaining almonds.",7.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many almonds each table can hold. Since each table can hold three times the number of almonds a bowl can hold, and each bowl can hold 24 almonds, each table can hold 3 * 24 = 72 almonds.

Carlos has 7 bowls and 3 tables, but 2 tables break. So, he has 7 bowls and 1 table left.

The total number of almonds that can be held by the bowls is 7 * 24 = 168 almonds.
The total number of almonds that can be held by the table is 1 * 72 = 72 almonds.

Carlos has 720 almonds, but he eats one-fifth of them. One-fifth of 720 is 720 / 5 = 144 almonds. So, he eats 144 almonds and has 720 - 144 = 576 almonds left.

The total number of almonds that can be held by the bowls and the table is 168 + 72 = 240 almonds. Since Carlos has 576 almonds left, he needs to find a way to hold 576 - 240 = 336 almonds.

Since each bowl can hold 24 almonds, the number of bowls needed to hold 336 almonds is 336 / 24 = 14 bowls.

The total capacity of the tables is: 3 tables * 72 almonds/table = 216 almonds.

However, 2 tables break, so the remaining capacity of the tables is: 1 table * 72 almonds/table = 72 almonds.
Now, the total capacity for the bowls and the remaining tables is: 168 almonds (bowls) + 72 almonds (table) = 240 almonds.

Carlos eats one-fifth of all the almonds, so the number of almonds left is: 720 almonds - 720 / 5 = 720 - 144 = 576 almonds.

We know that Diego is currently 19 years old.

In 9 years, Aisha will be 2 times as old as Diego is now. Since Diego is 19 years old now, in 9 years, Aisha will be 2 * 19 = 38 years old.

Since Aisha will be 38 years old in 9 years, we can calculate her current age. Aisha's current age is 38 - 9 = 29 years old.

Diego's brother, Esteban, is 6 years younger than Diego. So, Esteban's current age is 19 - 6 = 13 years old.

Aisha's sister Nadia is 10 years older than Esteban. So, Nadia's current age is 13 + 10 = 23 years old.

How much should Keisha pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?",85.0,"To find out how much Keisha should pay for all the skeins of wool she needs, we'll break down the problem into smaller steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of skeins needed for the grandchildren's winter wear**

* Shawl: 5 skeins x 4 grandchildren = 20 skeins
* Sweater: 6 skeins x 4 grandchildren = 24 skeins
* Poncho: 8 skeins x 4 grandchildren = 32 skeins
* Gloves: 8 skeins x 4 grandchildren = 32 skeins
* Mittens: 14 skeins x 4 grandchildren = 56 skeins

Total skeins for grandchildren's winter wear: 20 + 24 + 32 + 32 + 56 = 164 skeins

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of skeins needed for Keisha's warm jackets**

* 2 warm jackets x 8 skeins each = 16 skeins

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of skeins needed**

Total skeins needed = skeins for grandchildren's winter wear + skeins for Keisha's warm jackets

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the skeins**

* Each dozen skeins costs $7, so we need to calculate how many dozens of skeins Keisha needs:

**Step 5: Apply the promotion discount**

So, for each grandchild, she needs 5 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 14 = 41 skeins.
Since there are 4 grandchildren, she needs 41 * 4 = 164 skeins in total for the grandchildren.

Keisha also wants to make 2 warm jackets for herself, each needing 8 skeins of wool.

He has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 3 kgs of rice per day. The store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs; any additional rice is sold at the regular price. Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2. How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,"To find out how much Mohammed has to pay, we need to calculate the total cost of the rice and add the cost of the bagel.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice Mohammed needs to buy for a week.
Mohammed uses 3 kgs of rice per day, and he needs to buy rice for 7 days.
Total rice needed = 3 kgs/day x 7 days = 21 kgs

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice.
The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more.
Cost of more expensive brand = ¥15 per kg + (20% of ¥15 per kg)
= ¥15 per kg + ¥3 per kg
= ¥18 per kg

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the rice before discount.
Mohammed needs to buy 21 kgs of rice, but the discount only applies to the first 10 kgs.
Cost of first 10 kgs = ¥18 per kg x 10 kgs = ¥180
Cost of remaining 11 kgs = ¥18 per kg x 11 kgs = ¥198
Total cost of rice before discount = ¥180 + ¥198 = ¥378

Step 4: Calculate the discount on the first 10 kgs of rice.
The store offers a 40% discount on the first 10 kgs of rice.
Discount = 40% of ¥180
= ¥72

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the rice after discount.
Total cost of rice after discount = Total cost of rice before discount - Discount
= ¥378 - ¥72

Step 6: Add the cost of the bagel to the total cost of the rice.
Total cost = Total cost of rice after discount + Cost of bagel
= ¥306 + ¥2

Therefore, Mohammed has to pay ¥308.",308.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Mohammed needs to buy a week's worth of rice, which is 7 days.
He uses 3 kgs of rice per day.
So, the total amount of rice he needs is 7 * 3 = 21 kgs.

The normal brand of rice costs ¥15 per kg, but he has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more.
To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate 20% of ¥15.
20% of ¥15 is 0.20 * ¥15 = ¥3.
So, the more expensive brand costs ¥15 + ¥3 = ¥18 per kg.

However, the store has a 40% discount on rice, which applies only up to 10 kgs.
Mohammed needs 21 kgs of rice, but the discount only applies to the first 10 kgs.
So, the cost of the first 10 kgs is ¥18 * 10 = ¥180.
With the 40% discount, the cost of the first 10 kgs is ¥180 - (40% of ¥180) = ¥180 - ¥72 = ¥108.

The remaining 11 kgs (21 - 10 = 11) will be sold at the regular price of ¥18 per kg.
So, the cost of the remaining 11 kgs is ¥18 * 11 = ¥198.

However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of signatures Jasmine and Mia have collected so far.**

Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures. Let's add them up:

36 (Jasmine) + 31 (Mia) = 67 signatures

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of signatures they need to collect to reach their goal.**

Their goal is to collect 145 signatures between them. Since they already have 67 signatures, they need to collect:

145 (goal) - 67 (current total) = 78 signatures

**Step 3: Calculate the number of signatures Jasmine will collect during the remaining 2 weeks.**

Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 signatures per week, but we don't know her original weekly collection rate. However, we can calculate her total collection over 6 weeks:

36 signatures (Jasmine) ÷ 6 weeks = 6 signatures per week (original rate)

Since her weekly collection is reduced by 5 signatures per week, her new weekly rate is:

6 signatures/week - 5 signatures/week = 1 signature/week

Over 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect:

1 signature/week × 2 weeks = 2 signatures

**Step 4: Calculate the number of signatures Mia needs to collect to reach their goal.**

Since Jasmine will collect 2 signatures, Mia needs to collect the remaining signatures to reach their goal:

78 signatures (needed) - 2 signatures (Jasmine's contribution) = 76 signatures

Mia needs to collect 76 signatures over 2 weeks. To find out how many signatures she needs to collect per week, we'll divide the total by 2:

76 signatures ÷ 2 weeks = 38 signatures per week

Therefore, Mia needs to collect **38 signatures per week** to help them reach their goal of 145 signatures.",145.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Jasmine has 36 signatures and Mia has 31 signatures, so together they have 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

They want to reach a total of 145 signatures in 2 weeks.

To find out how many signatures they need to collect in total, we subtract the signatures they already have from their goal: 145 - 67 = 78 signatures.

Since Jasmine can only collect signatures on weekends, her weekly collection is reduced by 5. Let's assume her original weekly collection was x. Then, her reduced weekly collection is x - 5.

Since Jasmine collects signatures for 2 weeks, she will collect a total of 2(x - 5) signatures.

Mia's weekly collection is unknown, let's call it y. Since Mia collects signatures for 2 weeks, she will collect a total of 2y signatures.

The total number of signatures they need to collect is 78, so we can set up the equation: 2(x - 5) + 2y = 78.

We know that Jasmine's original weekly collection was 36 signatures in 6 weeks, so her original weekly collection was 36 / 6 = 6 signatures per week.

So, x = 6, and x - 5 = 1.

Now, we can substitute this value into the equation: 2(1) + 2y = 78.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 2 + 2y = 78.

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: 2y = 76.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get: y = 38.

So, Mia needs to collect 38 signatures per week to reach their goal.

Jasmine has 36 signatures.
Mia has 31 signatures.
So, the total number of signatures they have is 36 + 31 = 67.

They want to reach 145 signatures in total.
They still need 145 - 67 = 78 signatures.

There are 2 weeks left for spring break.
Jasmine's collection is reduced by 5 per week, but we first need to figure out how many signatures she collected per week previously. Since we don't have that information, we can only use the total number of signatures she collected in 6 weeks, which is 36.

Jasmine's weekly collection for 6 weeks is 36 / 6 = 6 signatures per week.
Her new weekly collection is 6 - 5 = 1 signature per week.

In 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect 1 * 2 = 2 signatures.

Then, it takes them another 52 minutes to get to the gym, so they have 230 - 52 = 178 minutes left.
However, they forgot their wallets at home and have to return to pick them up. The time taken to return home is the sum of the time taken to get to the cinema (16 minutes) and the time taken to get to the gym (52 minutes), so it is 16 + 52 = 68 minutes.
Since they have to walk back to the gym again, the total time spent walking back and forth is 68 * 2 = 136 minutes.

1. Giant cubes: 10 cubes x 12 ounces/cube = 120 ounces
2. Medium cubes: 12 cubes x 5 ounces/cube = 60 ounces
3. Small cubes: 14 cubes x 0.5 ounces/cube = 7 ounces
4. Tiny cubes: Since tiny cubes are half the size of small cubes, they use 0.5/2 = 0.25 ounces/cube. Let's call the number of tiny cubes 'x'. We'll find 'x' later.

Leon starts with 312 ounces of water.

He makes 10 giant cubes, each using 12 ounces of water.
So, the total water used for giant cubes is 10 * 12 = 120 ounces.

He makes 14 small cubes, each using 1/2 ounce of water.
So, the total water used for small cubes is 14 * 0.5 = 7 ounces.

He makes 12 medium cubes, each using 5 ounces of water.
So, the total water used for medium cubes is 12 * 5 = 60 ounces.

Let's calculate the total water used so far:
120 (giant) + 7 (small) + 60 (medium) = 187 ounces.

Since Leon makes 48 total ice cubes, and we already know he made 10 giant, 14 small, and 12 medium cubes, we can find the number of tiny cubes:
48 (total) - 10 (giant) - 14 (small) - 12 (medium) = 12 tiny cubes.

Each tiny cube is half the size of a small cube, which is 1/2 ounce. So, each tiny cube uses 1/4 ounce of water.
The total water used for tiny cubes is 12 * 0.25 = 3 ounces.

What percentage of the students like to play video games if the number of the students that like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football?",5.0,"To find the percentage of students who like to play video games, we need to first find the number of students who like to bake and video games.

Given:
Number of students who like to play football = 13
Number of students who like to bake = 3 less than four times the number of students who like to play football
= 4 * 13 - 3
= 52 - 3
= 49

Total number of students who like to hike, play chess, swim, and play football = 69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103

Number of students who like to bake and play video games = Total number of students - Number of students who like to hike, play chess, swim, and play football
= 160 - 103
= 57

Number of students who like to bake = 49
Number of students who like to play video games = 57 - 49
= 8

To find the percentage of students who like to play video games, divide the number of students who like to play video games by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

Percentage of students who like to play video games = (8 / 160) * 100
= 5%

Therefore, 5% of the students like to play video games.",5.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of students who like to hike, play chess, swim, and play football. 
The number of students who like to hike is 69.
The number of students who like to play chess is 8.
The number of students who like to swim is 13.
The number of students who like to play football is 13.
So, the total number of students who like these activities is 69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103.

Now, we know that the total number of students in the class is 160. 
So, the number of students who like to play video games or bake is 160 - 103 = 57.

We are also given that the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football. 
The number of students who like to play football is 13.
Four times this number is 4 * 13 = 52.
Three less than this number is 52 - 3 = 49.
So, the number of students who like to bake is 49.

Now, we can find the number of students who like to play video games. 
The number of students who like to play video games or bake is 57.
The number of students who like to bake is 49.
So, the number of students who like to play video games is 57 - 49 = 8.

Finally, we can find the percentage of students who like to play video games. 
The number of students who like to play video games is 8.
The total number of students in the class is 160.
So, the percentage of students who like to play video games is (8 / 160) * 100 = 5%.

Oliver has also applied for help from the local charity, which has decided to cover 1/10 of the remaining cost of the workshop. How much money is Oliver still missing?",113.0,"To find out how much money Oliver is still missing, let's break down the costs and calculate them step by step.

1. Total cost per day: ₣100 (hotel) + ₣20 (food) + ₣10 (transportation) = ₣130
2. Total cost for 2 days: ₣130 * 2 = ₣260
3. Friends are covering the cost of food for both days: ₣20 * 2 = ₣40
4. Subtract the cost of food from the total cost: ₣260 - ₣40 = ₣220
5. The local charity is covering 1/10 of the remaining cost: ₣220 / 10 = ₣22
6. Subtract the amount covered by the charity from the remaining cost: ₣220 - ₣22 = ₣198
7. Oliver has ₣85, so subtract that from the remaining cost: ₣198 - ₣85 = ₣113

Oliver is still missing ₣113.",113.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The workshop is 2 days long. 
Each day costs ₣100 for hotel, ₣20 for food, and ₣10 for transportation. 
So, the total cost per day is ₣100 + ₣20 + ₣10 = ₣130. 
For 2 days, the total cost is ₣130 * 2 = ₣260.

Oliver's friends have chipped in and will cover the cost of all the food for the workshop. 
Since the food costs ₣20 per day, the total cost of food for 2 days is ₣20 * 2 = ₣40.

So, subtracting the cost of food from the total cost, the remaining cost is ₣260 - ₣40 = ₣220.

Oliver has applied for help from the local charity, which has decided to cover 1/10 of the remaining cost. 
1/10 of ₣220 is ₣220 / 10 = ₣22.

The charity will cover ₣22, so the remaining cost is ₣220 - ₣22 = ₣198.

Oliver has ₣85, so to find out how much he is still missing, we subtract ₣85 from the remaining cost. 
The amount of money Oliver is still missing is ₣198 - ₣85 = ₣113.

The bakery has a promotion that if one buys 7 bagels or more, they get a 20% discount on bagels. How much more do 4 loaves of bread cost than 8 bagels?",12.0,"To find out how much more 4 loaves of bread cost than 8 bagels, we need to calculate the cost of both.

1. Cost of 4 loaves of bread:
Each loaf of bread costs €5. 
Cost of 4 loaves of bread = 4 * €5 = €20.

2. Cost of 8 bagels:
The cost of a bagel is one-fourth of a loaf of bread, so it's €5 / 4 = €1.25 per bagel.
Since the customer buys 8 bagels, they get a 20% discount. 
Original cost of 8 bagels = 8 * €1.25 = €10
Discount amount = 20% of €10 = 0.20 * €10 = €2
Cost of 8 bagels after discount = €10 - €2 = €8

Now, let's compare the costs:
Cost of 4 loaves of bread = €20
Cost of 8 bagels = €8
Cost difference = €20 - €8 = €12

So, 4 loaves of bread cost €12 more than 8 bagels.",8.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
A loaf of bread costs €5.
The cost of a bagel is one-fourth of a loaf of bread, which is €5 / 4 = €1.25.
The cost of 4 loaves of bread is 4 * €5 = €20.
The cost of 8 bagels without a discount is 8 * €1.25 = €10.
Since the bakery has a promotion for 7 or more bagels, 8 bagels get a 20% discount.
The discount for 8 bagels is 20% of €10, which is €10 * 0.2 = €2.
The cost of 8 bagels with the discount is €10 - €2 = €8.
So, the difference in cost between 4 loaves of bread and 8 bagels is €20 - €8 = €12.

Jamal starts with $80 and wants 10 gallons of paint, each priced at $7.0, and 3 carpenter pencils, each costing $2. The store offers a 10% discount on paint for members. How much more money does Elena have left than Jamal after they leave the store?",8.0,"To find out how much money Elena and Jamal have left, we need to calculate the total cost of their purchases and subtract that from the amount of money they started with.

**Elena's purchases:**

* 15 anchors at $0.26 each = 15 x $0.26 = $3.90
* 9 nails at $0.61 each = 9 x $0.61 = $5.49
* 10 gallons of paint at $7.00 each = 10 x $7.00 = $70.00

Total cost of Elena's purchases = $3.90 + $5.49 + $70.00 = $79.39

Elena started with $98.39, so she has:

$98.39 - $79.39 = $19.00 left

**Jamal's purchases:**

* 10 gallons of paint at $7.00 each, with a 10% discount = 10 x $7.00 x 0.9 = $63.00
* 3 carpenter pencils at $2.00 each = 3 x $2.00 = $6.00

Total cost of Jamal's purchases = $63.00 + $6.00 = $69.00

Jamal started with $80, so he has:

$80 - $69.00 = $11.00 left

Now, let's find out how much more money Elena has left than Jamal:

$19.00 (Elena's remaining money) - $11.00 (Jamal's remaining money) = $8.00

Elena has $8.00 more than Jamal after they leave the store.",8.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to calculate Elena's total cost. 
She buys 15 anchors at $0.26 each.
The total cost of anchors is 15 * $0.26 = $3.90.
She also buys 9 nails at $0.61 each.
The total cost of nails is 9 * $0.61 = $5.49.
Additionally, she buys 10 gallons of paint at $7.00 each.
The total cost of paint is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00.
So, Elena's total cost is $3.90 + $5.49 + $70.00 = $79.39.

Elena has $98.39 initially.
So, the amount of money left with Elena is $98.39 - $79.39 = $19.00.

Now, let's calculate Jamal's total cost. 
He buys 10 gallons of paint at $7.00 each, but as a member, he gets a 10% discount on paint.
The total cost of paint without discount is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00.
The discount on paint is 10% of $70.00, which is $7.00.
So, the total cost of paint with discount is $70.00 - $7.00 = $63.00.
He also buys 3 carpenter pencils at $2 each.
The total cost of pencils is 3 * $2 = $6.
So, Jamal's total cost is $63.00 + $6 = $69.

Jamal has $80 initially.
So, the amount of money left with Jamal is $80 - $69 = $11.

Now, let's find out how much more money Elena has left than Jamal.
Elena has $19.00 left, and Jamal has $11 left.
So, Elena has $19.00 - $11 = $8 more than Jamal.

Arash can eat 5 pieces a day.
Ava can eat twice as much as Arash, so Ava can eat 5 * 2 = 10 pieces a day.
DeShawn can eat twice as much as Ava, so DeShawn can eat 10 * 2 = 20 pieces a day.

Initially, the total number of pieces eaten per day is 5 + 10 + 20 = 35.

For the first 2 days, they eat 35 * 2 = 70 pieces.

After 2 days, DeShawn decides to cut his consumption by half, so DeShawn will eat 20 / 2 = 10 pieces a day.
Now, the total number of pieces eaten per day is 5 + 10 + 10 = 25.

There are 120 - 70 = 50 pieces left.
To eat 50 pieces at a rate of 25 pieces per day, it will take 50 / 25 = 2 days.

So, the total number of days it will take to eat the cake is 2 (initial days) + 2 (additional days) = 4.

Due to the pandemic, 20 patients are admitted into the care facility each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks.",530.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of occupied rooms**

The care facility has a capacity of 1900 rooms, and 1/4 of them are occupied. To find the number of occupied rooms, we'll multiply the total capacity by 1/4:

Occupied rooms = 1900 x 1/4
= 1900 x 0.25
= 475 rooms

**Step 2: Calculate the number of rooms out of service**

One-fourth of all the rooms are out of service. To find the number of rooms out of service, we'll multiply the total capacity by 1/4:

Rooms out of service = 1900 x 1/4
= 1900 x 0.25
= 475 rooms

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of unavailable rooms**

The total number of unavailable rooms is the sum of occupied rooms and rooms out of service:

Unavailable rooms = Occupied rooms + Rooms out of service
= 475 + 475
= 950 rooms

**Step 4: Calculate the initial number of unoccupied rooms**

The initial number of unoccupied rooms is the difference between the total capacity and the number of unavailable rooms:

Initial unoccupied rooms = Total capacity - Unavailable rooms
= 1900 - 950
= 950 rooms

**Step 5: Calculate the number of patients admitted in 3 weeks**

The care facility admits 20 patients per day. To find the total number of patients admitted in 3 weeks, we'll multiply the daily admission rate by the number of days in 3 weeks (21 days):

Patients admitted in 3 weeks = 20 patients/day x 21 days
= 420 patients

**Step 6: Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks**

The total number of unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks is the difference between the initial number of unoccupied rooms and the number of patients admitted in 3 weeks:

Total unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks = Initial unoccupied rooms - Patients admitted in 3 weeks
= 950 - 420
= 530 rooms

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks is 530 rooms.",530.0,1,"A: Let's think step by step.
The care facility has a capacity of 1900 rooms.
One-fourth of the rooms are occupied, which is 1900 * 1/4 = 475 occupied rooms.
One-fourth of the rooms are out of service, which is 1900 * 1/4 = 475 out of service rooms.
So, the total number of rooms that are either occupied or out of service is 475 + 475 = 950 rooms.
The total number of available rooms is 1900 - 950 = 950 rooms.
In 3 weeks, which is 21 days, 20 patients are admitted each day, so the total number of patients admitted is 21 * 20 = 420 patients.
The number of occupied rooms after 3 weeks is 475 + 420 = 895.
The number of unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks is 1900 - 895 - 475 = 530 rooms.

On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?",796.0,"To find Faisal's average daily earning, we need to calculate his total earnings over the three days and then divide by 3. Let's break it down step by step:

**Wednesday:**

* Muffins: 27 boxes
* Apricot pies: 13 fewer than Thursday, so we'll come back to this later

**Thursday:**

* Muffins: 11 more than Wednesday, so 27 + 11 = 38 boxes
* Apricot pies: 21 boxes

Now, let's go back to Wednesday's apricot pie sales. Since Faisal sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie on Wednesday than on Thursday, we can set up an equation:

Wednesday's apricot pie sales = Thursday's apricot pie sales - 13
= 21 - 13
= 8 boxes

So, on Wednesday, Faisal sold 8 boxes of apricot pie.

**Friday:**

* Faisal sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. Let's calculate the total sales for Wednesday and Thursday:
	+ Muffins: 27 (Wednesday) + 38 (Thursday) = 65 boxes
	+ Apricot pies: 8 (Wednesday) + 21 (Thursday) = 29 boxes
* On Friday, Faisal sold 65 boxes of muffins and 29 boxes of apricot pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

**Wednesday:**

* Muffins: 27 boxes × ₺9 = ₺243
* Apricot pies: 8 boxes × ₺21 = ₺168
* Total earnings: ₺243 + ₺168 = ₺411

**Thursday:**

* Muffins: 38 boxes × ₺9 = ₺342
* Apricot pies: 21 boxes × ₺21 = ₺441
* Total earnings: ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783

**Friday:**

* Muffins: 65 boxes × ₺9 = ₺585
* Apricot pies: 29 boxes × ₺21 = ₺609
* Total earnings: ₺585 + ₺609 = ₺1194

Now, let's calculate the total earnings over the three days:

₺411 (Wednesday) + ₺783 (Thursday) + ₺1194 (Friday) = ₺2388

₺2388 ÷ 3 = ₺796

On Wednesday, Faisal sold 27 boxes of muffins.
He sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pies than on Thursday, so we'll find that out later.

On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday, which is 27 + 11 = 38 boxes of muffins.
He sold 21 boxes of apricot pies on Thursday.

Now, we know that on Wednesday, Faisal sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pies than on Thursday.
So, the number of apricot pies sold on Wednesday is 21 - 13 = 8 boxes.

On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined.
So, the number of muffins sold on Friday is 27 + 38 = 65 boxes.
The number of apricot pies sold on Friday is 8 + 21 = 29 boxes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of muffins and apricot pies sold in the three days:
Muffins: 27 + 38 + 65 = 130 boxes
Apricot pies: 8 + 21 + 29 = 58 boxes

The total earnings from muffins is 130 * ₺9 = ₺1170

First, we need to find out how many students are swimmers. 
The total number of students is 120, and 50% of them are swimmers.
So, the number of swimmers is 50% of 120 = 0.5 * 120 = 60 swimmers.

However, half of the swimmers are absent for being sick.
So, the number of swimmers going to the tournament is 60 / 2 = 30.

Now, let's find out how many students are choir members or part of dancers.
The remaining class after removing the swimmers is 120 - 60 = 60 students.
45% of these students are choir members or part of dancers.
So, the number of choir members or dancers is 45% of 60 = 0.45 * 60 = 27.

To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we'll divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:

132 meters (flower bed length) ÷ 15 meters (space per plant) = 8.8

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 8 plants. This means Olga can fit 8 plants in her flower bed.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of plants Olga needs to buy**

Olga already owns 7 flowers, but she needs 8 plants to fill her flower bed. Therefore, she needs to buy:

8 plants (required) - 7 plants (already owned) = 1 plant

**Step 4: Calculate the cost of the plants**

Each flowering plant costs ₣9. Since Olga needs to buy 1 plant, the total cost would be:

1 plant × ₣9 per plant = ₣9

However, since Olga is buying more than 2 plants (she's buying 1, but she already owns 7, so the total is 8), she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. But wait, she's not buying more than 2 plants, she's buying only 1. So, the discount doesn't apply in this case.

**Step 5: Calculate the total cost**

The total cost for Olga to fill up her flower bed is the cost of the 1 plant she needs to buy:

₣9

So, Olga will spend ₣9 at the store to fill up her flower bed.",9.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many plants Olga needs to fill her flower bed. Each plant takes up 3 meters (its width) and needs 12 meters of space between it and the next plant. So, the total space each plant takes up is 3 + 12 = 15 meters.

The flower bed is 132 meters long. To find out how many plants Olga can fit, we divide the length of the flower bed by the space each plant takes up: 132 / 15 = 8.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 8 plants.

Olga already owns 7 flowers, so she needs to buy 8 - 7 = 1 more plant.

However, since she's buying only 1 plant, she won't receive the ₣5 discount. The cost of 1 plant is ₣9.

The answer is ₣9.",9.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Olga's flower bed is 132 meters long.
Each plant, including its width, takes up 3 + 12 = 15 meters.
To find out how many plants Olga needs, we divide the length of the flower bed by the space each plant takes up: 132 / 15 = 8.8.
Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, Olga needs 9 plants to fill her flower bed.

Olga already owns 7 flowers, so she needs to buy 9 - 7 = 2 more plants.

Each plant costs ₣9, so 2 plants would cost 2 * ₣9 = ₣18.
However, since Olga is buying more than 2 plants is not true, she is buying exactly 2, so she won't receive the ₣5 discount.

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,Olga can peel 6 clams a minute and saute 30 clams in 19 minutes. How many minutes will it take her to peel and saute 150 clams if it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam before peeling it? Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.,163.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to wash the clams**

Olga needs to wash 150 clams, and it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam. To find the total time, we'll multiply the number of clams by the time it takes to wash each clam:

150 clams × 12 seconds/clam = 1800 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we'll convert the total time to minutes:

1800 seconds ÷ 60 = 30 minutes

**Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to peel the clams**

Olga can peel 6 clams per minute. To find the time it takes to peel 150 clams, we'll divide the number of clams by the rate at which she peels them:

150 clams ÷ 6 clams/minute = 25 minutes

**Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to sauté the clams**

Olga can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes. To find the time it takes to sauté 150 clams, we'll multiply the number of clams by the time it takes to sauté a batch of 30 clams, and then divide by 30:

150 clams × (19 minutes / 30 clams) = 95 minutes

**Step 4: Add the break time and calculate the total time**

Olga needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams. We'll add the time it takes to wash the clams, peel the clams, take the break, and sauté the clams:

30 minutes (washing) + 25 minutes (peeling) + 13 minutes (break) + 95 minutes (sautéing) = 163 minutes

Therefore, it will take Olga 163 minutes to peel and sauté 150 clams.",150.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to calculate the time it takes Olga to peel 150 clams. She can peel 6 clams per minute.
So, the time it takes to peel 150 clams is 150 / 6 = 25 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to wash 150 clams before peeling. It takes 12 seconds to wash each clam.
There are 60 seconds in a minute, so the time it takes to wash 150 clams is (150 * 12) / 60 = 30 minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and wash the clams: 25 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (washing) = 55 minutes.

After peeling the clams, Olga takes a 13-minute break before sautéing them.

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes to sauté 150 clams. Olga can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes.
So, the time it takes to sauté 150 clams is (150 / 30) * 19 = 95 minutes.

Finally, we add the time it takes to peel, wash, take a break, and sauté the clams: 55 minutes (peeling and washing) + 13 minutes (break) + 95 minutes (sautéing) = 163 minutes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pineapples picked on Saturday and Sunday.
Saturday: 177 pineapples
Sunday: 183 pineapples
Total for Saturday and Sunday: 177 + 183 = 360 pineapples

Step 2: Calculate the number of pineapples picked on Monday.
Monday: Double the number of pineapples picked on Saturday = 2 * 177 = 354 pineapples

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pineapples picked from Saturday to Monday.
360 (Saturday and Sunday) + 354 (Monday) = 714 pineapples

Andre picks 177 pineapples on Saturday.
He picks 183 pineapples on Sunday.
So, the total number of pineapples picked on Saturday and Sunday is 177 + 183 = 360.

On Monday, he picks double the number of pineapples he did on Saturday, which is 2 * 177 = 354.

On Tuesday, he picks half the amount of what he picked in the past 3 days combined, which is 714 / 2 = 357.
So, the total number of pineapples picked is 714 + 357 = 1071.

On Wednesday, Andre is going to sell pineapples in boxes of 21 pineapples each.
To find out how many boxes he can make, we need to divide the total number of pineapples by 21: 1071 / 21 = 51.

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 50% for the second half. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?",1755.0,"To find out the total number of pizzas the family eats in two months, we need to break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Find the combined daily consumption of pizzas for the first month**

- The uncle eats 10 pizzas per day.
- The spouse eats 20 pizzas per day.
- The grandchild eats 2/4 of the combined number of pizzas they eat per day. 
  2/4 can be simplified to 1/2, so the grandchild eats half of the total pizzas eaten by the uncle and the spouse.
  Combined pizzas eaten by the uncle and the spouse = 10 + 20 = 30
  Pizzas eaten by the grandchild = 1/2 * 30 = 15
- Combined daily consumption of pizzas for the first month = 10 + 20 + 15 = 45

**Step 2: Calculate the total pizzas eaten in the first month**

- Since there are approximately 30 days in a month, the total pizzas eaten in the first month = 45 * 30 = 1350

**Step 3: Calculate the reduced daily consumption of pizzas for the first half of the second month**

- The family reduces their consumption by 60%, so the new daily consumption = 45 - (60/100 * 45) = 45 - 27 = 18

**Step 4: Calculate the total pizzas eaten in the first half of the second month**

- Since there are 15 days in the first half of the month, the total pizzas eaten in the first half = 18 * 15 = 270

**Step 5: Calculate the reduced daily consumption of pizzas for the second half of the second month**

- The family reduces their consumption by an additional 50%, so the new daily consumption = 18 - (50/100 * 18) = 18 - 9 = 9

**Step 6: Calculate the total pizzas eaten in the second half of the second month**

- Since there are 15 days in the second half of the month, the total pizzas eaten in the second half = 9 * 15 = 135

His spouse eats 20 pizzas per day.
Their grandchild eats two-fourths (or half) of the combined number of pizzas they eat per day.
The combined number of pizzas the uncle and spouse eat per day is 10 + 20 = 30.
The grandchild eats half of that, which is 30 / 2 = 15 pizzas per day.
So, the total number of pizzas the family eats per day is 10 + 20 + 15 = 45.
In the first month, they eat 45 pizzas per day for 30 days, which is 45 * 30 = 1350 pizzas.

In the second month, they reduce their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month.
This means they eat 40% of their original amount, which is 0.4 * 45 = 18 pizzas per day.
For the first half of the month (15 days), they eat 18 * 15 = 270 pizzas.

For the second half of the month, they reduce their food consumption by an additional 50% of the already reduced amount.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of emails that don't require a response**

Mohammed receives 30 emails a day, and 20% of them don't require a response. To calculate 20% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.2:

30 x 0.2 = 6

So, 6 emails don't require a response.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of emails that require a response**

Since 6 emails don't require a response, the number of emails that require a response is:

30 - 6 = 24

**Step 3: Calculate the number of emails Mohammed can respond to**

Mohammed can respond to 2 less than half of the emails that require a response. Half of 24 is:

24 / 2 = 12

2 less than 12 is:

12 - 2 = 10

So, Mohammed can respond to 10 emails per day.

For the first 5 days, Mohammed responds to 10 emails per day. For the last day, he responds to 10% more emails than usual. To calculate 10% of 10, we multiply 10 by 0.1:

10 x 0.1 = 1

So, on the last day, Mohammed responds to 10 + 1 = 11 emails.

The total number of emails Mohammed responds to in a 6-day work week is:

Therefore, Mohammed responds to 61 emails in a 6-day work week.",6.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Mohammed receives 30 emails a day.
20% of those emails don't require any response, so the number of emails that require a response is 30 - (20% of 30).

So, the number of emails that require a response is 30 - 6 = 24.

From the rest, Mohammed can only respond to 2 less than the 1/2 of them.
Half of 24 is 24 / 2 = 12.
2 less than 12 is 12 - 2 = 10.

1. Ananya's original speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Since she walks 10 miles in 50 minutes, her original speed on the beach is:

Ananya walks 10 miles on the beach and 14 miles on the sidewalk.
She walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.
However, her speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk due to an injury.

First, let's find her original speed on the beach. We know she spends 50 minutes walking 10 miles on the beach, but her speed has decreased by half. So, her original speed on the beach would have allowed her to walk 10 miles in half the time, which is 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

Now, let's find her original speed on the beach in miles per minute. We can do this by dividing the distance by the time: 10 miles / 25 minutes = 0.4 miles per minute.

Since she walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her original speed on the sidewalk would be 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 miles per minute.

However, her speed has decreased by half due to the injury. So, her new speed on the sidewalk is 0.8 / 2 = 0.4 miles per minute.

Now, let's find the time it takes for her to walk 14 miles on the sidewalk at her new speed: 14 miles / 0.4 miles per minute = 35 minutes.

The answer is 0.",0.0,0,"Q: Amelia initially had 11 dozen cookies, then ate 5 cookies for breakfast, and then hid the rest in the yard for the Easter egg hunt. Elena finds 5 cookies. Mei finds twice as many as Elena. Xavier finds 2 less than Mei. Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier, and Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined. How many cookies are still hidden in the yard?
A: Let's think step by step.
Amelia initially had 11 dozen cookies, which is 11 * 12 = 132 cookies.
She ate 5 cookies for breakfast.
So, the number of cookies left is 132 - 5 = 127 cookies.
Elena finds 5 cookies.
Mei finds twice as many as Elena, which is 2 * 5 = 10 cookies.
Xavier finds 2 less than Mei, which is 10 - 2 = 8 cookies.
Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier, which is 8 / 8 = 1 cookie.
Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined, which is 2 * 12 + (10 + 5) = 24 + 15 = 39 cookies.
The total number of cookies found by Elena, Mei, Xavier, Mohammed, and Umar is 5 + 10 + 8 + 1 + 39 = 63 cookies.
So, the number of cookies still hidden in the yard is 127 - 63 = 64 cookies.

The first 2 have 100 apartments each and the last one is 35% bigger than the other 2 combined. However, this week, 9 apartments from each of the first 2 complexes were vacant and did not require collection service. Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each place and he gets paid ₣0.5 per collection for each apartment. He also earns an additional 10% in tips. How much money does he make in a week?",1243.0,"To find out how much money Oscar makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from, the total number of collections he makes, and then multiply that by his pay per collection and add the tips. Let's break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes**

Each of the first 2 complexes has 100 apartments, so the total number of apartments in these 2 complexes is:

100 + 100 = 200 apartments

**Step 2: Calculate the number of apartments in the last complex**

The last complex is 35% bigger than the other 2 combined. To find the number of apartments in the last complex, we need to calculate 35% of 200 and add it to 200.

35% of 200 = 0.35 x 200 = 70
200 + 70 = 270 apartments

So, the last complex has 270 apartments.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of apartments Oscar collects garbage from**

Now, we need to subtract the vacant apartments from the first 2 complexes. There are 9 vacant apartments in each of the first 2 complexes, so we subtract 18 apartments from the total.

200 - 18 = 182 apartments (from the first 2 complexes)
Adding the last complex, we get:
182 + 270 = 452 apartments

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of collections Oscar makes in a week**

Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections he makes in a week is:

452 apartments x 5 collections/week = 2260 collections/week

**Step 5: Calculate Oscar's weekly earnings**

Oscar gets paid ₣0.5 per collection, so his weekly earnings are:

2260 collections/week x ₣0.5/collection = ₣1130/week

**Step 6: Calculate the tips**

Oscar earns an additional 10% in tips, so we need to calculate 10% of his weekly earnings and add it to his earnings.

10% of ₣1130 = 0.10 x ₣1130 = ₣113
₣1130 + ₣113 = ₣1243

Therefore, Oscar makes ₣1243 in a week.",1243.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to calculate the number of apartments in the last complex. The first 2 complexes have 100 apartments each, for a total of 200 apartments. The last complex is 35% bigger than the other 2 combined. So, the number of apartments in the last complex is 200 + (35% of 200) = 200 + (0.35 * 200) = 200 + 70 = 270 apartments.

However, 9 apartments from each of the first 2 complexes were vacant and did not require collection service. So, the actual number of apartments that require collection service from the first 2 complexes is 100 - 9 = 91 apartments each, for a total of 182 apartments.

The total number of apartments that require collection service is 182 + 270 = 452 apartments.

Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 452 * 5 = 2260 collections.

He gets paid ₣0.5 per collection for each apartment, so his total earnings per week are 2260 * ₣0.5 = ₣1130.

He also earns an additional 10% in tips, so his total tips are ₣1130 * 0.1 = ₣113.

Therefore, his total earnings per week are ₣1130 + ₣113 = ₣1243.

The answer is ₣1243.",1243.0,1,,1243.0,1

How much would a 60-minute call cost?",24.0,"To find the cost of a 60-minute call, we need to break it down into three parts based on the given rates.

1. The first 10 minutes cost ₺0.8 per minute. 
   Cost for the first 10 minutes = 10 * 0.8 = ₺8

2. The next 30 minutes (from 10 to 40 minutes) cost ₺0.7 per minute.

Now, let's add up the costs for all three parts:
Total cost = ₺8 + ₺21 + ₺1 = ₺30

Since the total bill is more than ₺25, you get a 20% discount on your total bill.
Discount = 20% of ₺30 = 0.2 * 30 = ₺6

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:

So, the cost for the first 10 minutes is 10 * ₺0.8 = ₺8.

For the next 30 minutes, the cost is ₺0.7 per minute.
So, the cost for the next 30 minutes is 30 * ₺0.7 = ₺21.

For the final 20 minutes, the cost is ₺0.1 per two minutes, or ₺0.05 per minute.
So, the cost for the final 20 minutes is 20 * ₺0.05 = ₺1.

Now, let's add up the costs for each part: ₺8 + ₺21 + ₺1 = ₺30.

The total bill is ₺30, which is more than ₺25, so we get a 20% discount.
The discount is 20% of ₺30, which is 0.2 * ₺30 = ₺6.

If they work for 8 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?",50.0,"To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning rooms, we need to first find the total time spent cleaning all rooms and then divide it by the total time the janitor works in 10 days.

1. The janitor has 200 rooms to clean. It originally took 6 minutes per room but now it will take twice as long. So, it will take 2 x 6 = 12 minutes per room.

2. The total time spent cleaning all rooms is 200 rooms x 12 minutes per room = 2400 minutes.

3. Since the janitor works 8 hours a day, the total time the janitor works in 10 days is 8 hours per day x 10 days = 80 hours. Converting hours to minutes, it is 80 hours x 60 minutes per hour = 4800 minutes.

4. The average time spent cleaning per day is the total time spent cleaning all rooms (2400 minutes) divided by the number of days (10 days), which is 2400 minutes / 10 days = 240 minutes per day.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, they work 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day.
The total time to clean all the rooms is 2400 minutes, and they work 480 minutes per day, so it will take them 2400 / 480 = 5 days.
However, the question is asking for the percentage of their day spent cleaning rooms, on average, over the 10 days.
Since it will take them 5 days to clean the rooms, they will be cleaning rooms for 5 days and not cleaning for 5 days.
On the days they are cleaning, the percentage of their day spent cleaning is (480 / 480) * 100% = 100%.

3. In the next 10 seconds, the kernels pop at 4 times the initial rate, which is 4 * 70 = 280 kernels.

4. In the final 10 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the past 10 seconds, which is (1/2) * 280 = 140 kernels.

If there are 30 bricks in the building in total, what percentage of bricks are green?",50.0,"The building is made out of 5 white bricks, twice as many orange bricks, and an unknown number of green bricks. If there are 30 bricks in the building in total, what percentage of bricks are green? We can solve this problem by setting up a system of equations. Let's let x represent the number of green bricks. We know that there are 5 white bricks, so we can write the equation: 5 + 2x = 30. We also know that there are twice as many orange bricks as there are white bricks, so we can write the equation: 2x = 30. We can solve this system of equations by subtracting the second equation from the first equation. This gives us the equation: 5 + 2x - 2x = 30 - 30, which simplifies to 5 = 0. This means that there are 5 green bricks in the building. We can now calculate the percentage of bricks that are green by dividing the number of green bricks by the total number of bricks. This gives us the equation: 5/30 = 0.1667, which means that 16.67% of the bricks in the building are green.

The building has 5 white bricks.
It has twice as many orange bricks, so the number of orange bricks is 2 * 5 = 10.
The total number of white and orange bricks is 5 + 10 = 15.
The total number of bricks in the building is 30.
So, the number of green bricks is 30 - 15 = 15.
To find the percentage of green bricks, we need to divide the number of green bricks by the total number of bricks and multiply by 100.
The percentage of green bricks is (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.

1. Olivia will be 42 in 7 years, so her current age is 42 - 7 = 35.

2. Since Olivia is 24 years younger than Bodhi, Bodhi's age is 35 + 24 = 59.

3. Olivia is 15 years older than Keisha, so Keisha's age is 35 - 15 = 20.

4. The average age of all three is (35 + 59 + 20) / 3 = 114 / 3 = 38.

5. Keisha is 38 - 20 = 18 years younger than the average age of all three.

Since Olivia is 15 years older than Keisha, Keisha's current age is 35 - 15 = 20.

To find the average age of all three, we need to add their ages and divide by 3.
The sum of their ages is 35 + 59 + 20 = 114.
The average age is 114 / 3 = 38.
