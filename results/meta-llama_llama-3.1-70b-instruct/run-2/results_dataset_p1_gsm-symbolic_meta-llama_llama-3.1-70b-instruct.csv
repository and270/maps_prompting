She bought 6 dozen croissants which cost $19 per dozen, 4 dozen macarons which cost $77 per dozen, and 3 dozen brownies for $118 per dozen. How much was the total cost if she received 25% discount on all purchases?",582.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the total cost of each item:

- 6 dozen croissants = 6 x $19 = $114
- 4 dozen macarons = 4 x $77 = $308
- 3 dozen brownies = 3 x $118 = $354

2. Now, we add the total cost of each item to get the total cost before the discount:

$114 + $308 + $354 = $776

3. Since Beatriz received a 25% discount on all purchases, we need to calculate the discount amount:

25% of $776 = 0.25 x $776 = $194

4. Finally, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost to get the final total cost:

$776 - $194 = $582

So, the total cost after the 25% discount is $582.",582.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Beatriz bought 6 dozen croissants at $19 per dozen.
So, the total cost of croissants is 6 * 19 = $114.

She bought 4 dozen macarons at $77 per dozen.
So, the total cost of macarons is 4 * 77 = $308.

She bought 3 dozen brownies at $118 per dozen.
So, the total cost of brownies is 3 * 118 = $354.

The total cost of all baked goods is 114 + 308 + 354 = $776.

Beatriz received a 25% discount on the total purchase.
To find the discount amount, multiply the total cost by 25% (or 0.25).
The discount amount is 776 * 0.25 = $194.

So, the total cost after the discount is 776 - 194 = $582.

But as I pour it, I spill 7 liters of the mango drink. To make up for that, I add 7 liters of water to the mix. What percentage of the final mix is water?",50.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the mango drink**

You have 16 liters of mango drink that is one-ninth water. To find the amount of water in the mango drink, multiply the total amount by the fraction of water:

16 liters x (1/9) = 16/9 liters = 1.78 liters (approximately)

So, the mango drink contains approximately 1.78 liters of water.

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the apple drink**

You have 14 liters of apple drink that is one-half water. To find the amount of water in the apple drink, multiply the total amount by the fraction of water:

14 liters x (1/2) = 14/2 liters = 7 liters

So, the apple drink contains 7 liters of water.

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water after spilling and adding water**

You spill 7 liters of the mango drink, which means you lose 7/9 liters of water (since the mango drink is one-ninth water):

7 liters x (1/9) = 7/9 liters = 0.78 liters (approximately)

You now have:

* 1.78 liters (initial water in mango drink) - 0.78 liters (lost water) = 1 liter of water from the mango drink
* 7 liters of water from the apple drink
* 7 liters of water added to make up for the spill

Total amount of water: 1 liter + 7 liters + 7 liters = 15 liters

**Step 4: Calculate the total volume of the final mix**

You have:

* 16 liters (initial mango drink) - 7 liters (spilled) = 9 liters of mango drink
* 14 liters of apple drink
* 7 liters of water added

Total volume of the final mix: 9 liters + 14 liters + 7 liters = 30 liters

**Step 5: Calculate the percentage of water in the final mix**

To find the percentage of water in the final mix, divide the total amount of water by the total volume of the final mix and multiply by 100:

(15 liters / 30 liters) x 100% â‰ˆ 50%

So, the final mix is approximately 50% water.",50.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to calculate the amount of water in the mango drink. Since it's one-ninth water, the amount of water in the mango drink is 1/9 * 16 = 16/9 liters.

To make it simpler, let's multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 9 to get rid of the fraction in the denominator, which equals 1.78 liters (1.778 rounded to two decimal places).

Now, we have 9 liters of the mango drink left after spilling 7 liters.

The amount of water in the 9 liters of the mango drink is 1.78 * (9/16) = 1 liters.

Next, we need to calculate the amount of water in the apple drink. Since it's one-half water, the amount of water in the apple drink is 1/2 * 14 = 7 liters.

Now, we add 7 liters of water to the mix, so the total amount of water is 1 + 7 + 7 = 15 liters.

The total amount of the mix is 9 + 14 + 7 = 30 liters.

Finally, we can calculate the percentage of the final mix that is water. The percentage is (15/30) * 100 = 50%.

If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 10 hours if she spends 2/5 of the time running, 1/2 of the time skipping, and the remaining of the time walking?",27.0,"To find out how many miles Mei can travel, we need to find out how many miles she can travel in each activity and then add them up.

First, we know that Mei can skip at 2 miles per hour. Since she can run four times as fast as she can walk, she can run twice as fast as she can skip (since skipping is 1/2 as fast as running). So, she can run at 2 * 2 = 4 miles per hour.

Since she can run four times as fast as she can walk, she can walk at 4 / 4 = 1 mile per hour.

Now, we know how much time she spends on each activity:

* She spends 2/5 of the time running, which is 2/5 * 10 hours = 4 hours.
* She spends 1/2 of the time skipping, which is 1/2 * 10 hours = 5 hours.
* She spends the remaining time walking, which is 10 - 4 - 5 = 1 hour.

Now, we can calculate how many miles she can travel in each activity:

* Running: 4 hours * 4 miles/hour = 16 miles
* Skipping: 5 hours * 2 miles/hour = 10 miles
* Walking: 1 hour * 1 mile/hour = 1 mile

In total, Mei can travel 16 + 10 + 1 = 27 miles in 10 hours.

The answer is 27.",27.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Mei can skip at 2 miles per hour.
Since she can skip at a rate of speed that is 1/2 as fast as she can run, she can run at 2 * 2 = 4 miles per hour.

Mei can run four times faster than she can walk, so she can walk at 4 / 4 = 1 mile per hour.

Mei spends 2/5 of the time running, which is (2/5) * 10 = 4 hours.
She spends 1/2 of the time skipping, which is (1/2) * 10 = 5 hours.
The remaining time is spent walking, which is 10 - 4 - 5 = 1 hour.

The distance Mei travels while running is 4 miles/hour * 4 hours = 16 miles.
The distance Mei travels while skipping is 2 miles/hour * 5 hours = 10 miles.
The distance Mei travels while walking is 1 mile/hour * 1 hour = 1 mile.

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has 200 calories per serving. If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?",180.0,"To find out how many oz of cookies you can eat, we need to first calculate the calories you have left for the day.

Your daily calorie target is 2300 calories. You've already consumed 1200 calories and burned 100 calories through exercise, so the total calories you've used up is 1200 - 100 = 1100 calories (since you burned 100 calories, it's like you only consumed 1200 - 100 = 1100 calories).

Now, subtract 1100 from your daily calorie target:

2300 - 1100 = 1200

So, you have 1200 calories left for the day.

Now, let's find out how many calories are in the bag of cookies. The bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 200 calories, so the total calories in the bag are:

5 servings x 200 calories/serving = 1000 calories

Since you have 1200 calories left for the day, you can consume up to 1000 calories from the cookies (since that's the maximum calories in the bag).

To find out how many oz of cookies you can eat, we need to first find out how many oz are in one serving. The bag is 150 oz and has 5 servings, so:

150 oz / 5 servings = 30 oz/serving

Now, since you can consume up to 1000 calories from the cookies, and each serving has 200 calories and 30 oz, you can eat:

1000 calories / 200 calories/serving = 5 servings (but you can't eat 5 servings since that's the whole bag and you only have 1200 calories left)

Since you can only consume 1200 calories, and 1000 calories is the maximum calories in the bag, let's find the fraction of the bag you can eat:

1200 calories / 1000 calories = 1.2 (but since you can't eat 1.2 bags, we'll find the fraction of the bag you can eat)

1.2 x (5 servings) = 6 servings (but since you can't eat 6 servings, we'll find the fraction of the servings)

Since you can eat 1200 calories, and each serving has 200 calories, you can eat:

1200 / 200 = 6 servings (but since you can't eat 6 servings, we'll find the fraction of the servings you can eat)

You can eat 5.98 servings (approximately, rounded to 2 decimal places), which is almost 6 servings.

Now, since you can eat almost 6 servings, and each serving has 30 oz, you can eat approximately:

6 servings x 30 oz/serving = 180 oz 

However, since you can only eat 1200 calories and the bag has 1000 calories, you can eat approximately 5.98 servings or approximately 179.4 oz (since 5.98 x 30 oz/serving = 179.4 oz).

Rounded to the nearest whole number, you can eat approximately 179 oz.",179.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories are left in your daily target. 
You have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories, which means you have burned 100 calories.
So, the total calories you have consumed or burned is 1200 - 100 = 1100 calories.
You have a daily calorie target of 2300 calories.
So, the number of calories left is 2300 - 1100 = 1200 calories.

Now, we need to find out how many calories are in the bag of cookies.
The bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 200 calories.
So, the total number of calories in the bag is 5 * 200 = 1000 calories.

Since you have 1200 calories left in your daily target, and the bag of cookies has 1000 calories, you can eat the entire bag without exceeding your daily calorie target.

However, the question asks how many oz you can eat, not how many calories.

First, we need to find out how many calories are left in the daily target.
The daily calorie target is 2300.
You have already consumed 1200 calories.
You also exercised for 100 calories, which means you burned 100 calories.
So, the net calories consumed is 1200 - 100 = 1100.
The remaining calories allowed is 2300 - 1100 = 1200.

Since the bag of cookies has 200 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat within the remaining calorie limit.
The remaining calories allowed is 1200.
Each serving has 200 calories.
So, the number of servings you can eat is 1200 / 200 = 6.

However, the question asks for the number of oz you can eat, not the number of servings.
The bag has 5 servings in 150 oz.
So, the number of oz per serving is 150 / 5 = 30 oz per serving.
You can eat 6 servings, but the bag only has 5 servings.
Since you can't eat more than the bag has, you can eat 5 servings.
The number of oz you can eat is 5 * 30 = 150 oz.

## Summary

We can use powers of 10 to make multiplying and dividing decimals easier.

To multiply decimals, we can multiply whole numbers, then apply one of the following rules:

â€¢ If both the original factors have decimals, count the total number of decimal places in the factors (counting tenths as one decimal place, hundredths as two decimal places, etc.). The product will have the same number of decimal places.
â€¢ If only one of the original factors have decimals, the product will have the same number of decimal places as the decimal factor.

For example:

â€¢ $$32.7 \boldcdot 8 = 262.6$$ because 32.7 has one decimal place and 8 has none, and $$1+0=1$$.
â€¢ $$32.7 \boldcdot 0.8 = 26.16$$ because 32.7 has one decimal place and 0.8 has one decimal place, and $$1+1=2$$.
â€¢ $$0.327 \boldcdot 8 = 2.616$$ because 0.327 has three decimal places and 8 has none, and $$3+0=3$$.

To divide decimals, we can use an opposite process:

â€¢ If the divisor has a decimal, we can multiply both the dividend and divisor by a power of 10 so that the divisor no longer has a decimal. (This is the same as multiplying by a fraction that is equal to 1, e.g. $$\frac{10}{10}$$ or $$\frac{100}{100}$$).
â€¢ Next, divide the new values using whole numbers.
â€¢ The quotient of the new values is the same as the quotient of the original values.

For example, $$45 \div 6 = \frac{45}{6} = \frac{450}{60} = 7.5$$, so $$4.5 \div 0.6 = 7.5$$ because $$4.5 = \frac{45}{10}$$ and $$0.6 = \frac{6}{10}$$.

## Glossary

#### decimal point

The dot that separates the whole number and fractional parts of a decimal number.

#### fraction

A number expressible in the form $$\frac{a}{b}\$$ where $$a$$ is a whole number and $$b$$ is a positive whole number.

#### long division

Long division is a way to show the steps for dividing numbers in decimal form. It finds the quotient one digit at a time, from left to right.

For example, here is the long division for $$57 \div 4$$.

$$\displaystyle \require{enclose} \begin{array}{r} 14.25 \\[-3pt] 4 \enclose{longdiv}{57.00}\kern-.2ex \\[-3pt] \underline{-4\phantom {0}}\phantom{.00} \\[-3pt] 17\phantom {.00} \\[-3pt]\underline{-16}\phantom {.00}\\[-3pt]{10\phantom{.0}} \\[-3pt]\underline{-8}\phantom{.0}\\ \phantom{0}20 \\[-3pt] \underline{-20} \\[-3pt] \phantom{00}0 \end{array}$$

#### percentage

A percentage is aÂ rate per 100.

For example, a fish tank can hold 36 liters.Â Right now there is 27 liters of water in the tank. The percentage of the tankÂ that is full is 75%.

#### percentage decrease

A percentageÂ decreaseÂ tells how much a quantity went down, expressed as a percentage of the starting amount.

For example, a store had 64 hats in stock on Friday. They had 48 hats left on Saturday. The amount went down by 16.

This was a 25% decrease, because 16 is 25% of 64.

#### repeating decimal

A repeating decimal has digits that keep going in the same pattern over and over. The repeating digits are marked with a line above them.

For example, the decimal representation forÂ $$\frac13$$Â isÂ $$0.\overline{3}$$, which means 0.3333333 . . . TheÂ decimal representation forÂ $$\frac{25}{22}$$Â is $$1.1\overline{36}$$ which means 1.136363636 . . .

#### whole number

A whole number is a number that has no fractions or decimals.

If written in digits, it has no digits to the right of a decimal point.

0, 7, 2153, and 345678 are examples of whole numbers.",345678.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

On Wednesday, he watched two 5-hour episodes, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he watched four 15-minute episodes, which is 4 * 0.25 = 1 hour.
So, the total hours of TV watched on these days is 8 + 3.75 + 10 + 1 = 22.75 hours.

Since the ratio of sugar to water is 63:14, we can let the amount of sugar be 63x and the amount of water be 14x. 

We are also given that the ratio of milk to water is 9:7, so we can let the amount of milk be 9y and the amount of water be 7y. However, we already have an expression for the amount of water (14x), so we can set 14x equal to 7y and solve for y in terms of x:

14x = 7y
y = 2x

Now we can express the amount of milk in terms of x:
9y = 9(2x) = 18x

The total amount of sugar, water, and milk Fatima used is 760, so we can set up the following equation:

63x + 14x + 18x = 760
95x = 760

We know that Fatima uses teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 63:14. We also know that she uses 9 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water.

First, let's find the total number of parts in the ratio of sugar to water: 63 + 14 = 77.

Since the ratio of sugar to water is 63:14, and the ratio of water to milk is 7:9, we can find the total number of parts in the ratio of sugar to water to milk: 63 + 14 + (9/7)*14 = 63 + 14 + 18 = 95.

We are given that the total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk is 760. We can set up an equation using the ratio:

(63/95)x + (14/95)x + (18/95)x = 760

Combine like terms:

(95/95)x = 760

x = 760

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row?,43.75,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of each event and then compare them.

**Probability of rolling a number greater than 10:**

A 20-sided die has numbers from 1 to 20. There are 10 numbers greater than 10 (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20). So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is:

10 (favorable outcomes) / 20 (total outcomes) = 1/2 or 0.5

**Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row:**

The probability of rolling an odd number on a 20-sided die is 10/20, since there are 10 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19). To roll four odd numbers in a row, we need to multiply the probability of rolling an odd number four times:

(10/20) Ã— (10/20) Ã— (10/20) Ã— (10/20) = (1/2) Ã— (1/2) Ã— (1/2) Ã— (1/2) = 1/16 or 0.0625

**Comparing the probabilities:**

Now, let's compare the probabilities:

Probability of rolling a number greater than 10: 0.5
Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row: 0.0625

To find the difference in percentage, we can subtract the smaller probability from the larger one and multiply by 100:

(0.5 - 0.0625) Ã— 100% â‰ˆ 43.75%

So, it is approximately 43.75% more likely that Luis rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row.",10.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two separate events and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 on a 20-sided die. There are 10 numbers greater than 10 (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20) out of a total of 20 possible outcomes. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is:

10 (favorable outcomes) / 20 (total outcomes) = 0.5 or 50%

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row. The probability of rolling an odd number on a 20-sided die is 10/20, since there are 10 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19) out of a total of 20 possible outcomes. To calculate the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row, we need to multiply the probability of rolling an odd number four times:

(10/20) Ã— (10/20) Ã— (10/20) Ã— (10/20) = (1/2) Ã— (1/2) Ã— (1/2) Ã— (1/2) = 1/16 or 6.25%

Now, let's compare the two probabilities. To find the percentage difference, we can subtract the smaller probability from the larger probability and divide by the smaller probability, then multiply by 100:

((50% - 6.25%) / 6.25%) Ã— 100% â‰ˆ 700%

So, it is approximately 700% more likely that Luis rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row.

The answer is 700%.",700.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two separate events and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 on a 20-sided die.
There are 10 numbers greater than 10 on a 20-sided die (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20).
So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is 10/20 = 0.5.

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row.
The probability of rolling an odd number on a 20-sided die is 10/20 = 0.5.
Since the die is rolled four times, we need to multiply the probability of rolling an odd number four times: (0.5)^4 = 0.0625.

Now, let's compare the two probabilities.
The probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is 0.5.
The probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row is 0.0625.
To find the percentage difference, we can use the following formula: ((0.5 - 0.0625) / 0.0625) * 100% â‰ˆ 700%.

However, this is not the correct way to express the difference in likelihood. A more accurate way is to express it as a ratio or a percentage increase. In this case, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is approximately 8 times higher than the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row.

To express this as a percentage, we can say that it is 700% more likely to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll four odd numbers in a row. However, this is still not entirely accurate.

A more accurate way to express the difference in likelihood is to say that the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is 8 times the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row, or that it is 7 times more likely to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll four odd numbers in a row.

The answer is 700% (but this is not entirely accurate, a more accurate answer would be ""7 times more likely"" or ""8 times the probability"").",8.0,0

We know that the number of ladybugs is 1/6 the number of ants. Since there are 24 ants, the number of ladybugs is:

24 x 1/6 = 24/6 = 4

So, there are 4 ladybugs.

We also know that there are 64 rabbits, 36 grasshoppers, and 24 ants. To find the total number of animals, we add these numbers together:

Total number of animals = 64 (rabbits) + 36 (grasshoppers) + 24 (ants) + 4 (ladybugs)
Total number of animals = 128

Now, we can find the percentage of animals that were rabbits by dividing the number of rabbits by the total number of animals and multiplying by 100:

1. Yuki was a pen pal with 8 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 4 of them. So, he is now pen pals with:

8 - 4 = 4 people

2. Each of these 4 people sends 3 letters a week, and Yuki responds in kind. So, the total number of letters Yuki writes per week is:

1.71 letters/day x 10 pages/letter = 17.1 pages/day

4. Yuki can write a page every 14 minutes. To find the total time he spends writing per day, we can multiply the number of pages he writes per day by the time it takes him to write one page:

17.1 pages/day x 14 minutes/page = 239.4 minutes/day

5. Finally, we can convert the total time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

Yuki was a pen pal with 8 people, but he stopped being penpals with 4 of them.
So, he is now a pen pal with 8 - 4 = 4 people.

So, the total number of letters he writes in a week is 4 * 3 = 12 letters.

Each letter is 10 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes in a week is 12 * 10 = 120 pages.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the average number of pages he writes in a day is 120 / 7 = 17.14 pages (approximately).

It takes him 14 minutes to write a page, so the average time he spends writing in a day is 17.14 * 14 = 240 minutes.

2. Next, we need to find the total number of people who left after 45 minutes. We are given that two-thirds of the total number of people left. To find this number, we can multiply the total number of people by 2/3:

Total number of people * (2/3) = Number of people who left
72 * (2/3) = 48

So, 48 people left.

3. We are given that 22 lawyers remained. To find the number of lawyers who left, we can subtract the number of lawyers who remained from the total number of lawyers:

Total number of lawyers - Number of lawyers who remained = Number of lawyers who left
23 - 22 = 1

So, 1 lawyer left.

4. Since 48 people left in total, and 1 of them was a lawyer, the number of nurses who left is:

Number of people who left - Number of lawyers who left = Number of nurses who left
48 - 1 = 47

So, 47 nurses left.

5. Finally, to find the number of nurses who stayed, we can subtract the number of nurses who left from the total number of nurses:

Total number of nurses - Number of nurses who left = Number of nurses who stayed
49 - 47 = 2

Therefore, 2 nurses stayed at the gathering.",2.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
There were 72 people initially.
23 were lawyers, so the number of nurses is 72 - 23 = 49 nurses.
Two-thirds of the people left, which means one-third of the people stayed.
Since 22 lawyers remained, the number of lawyers who left is 23 - 22 = 1.
The total number of people who left is 2/3 of 72, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48.
The number of nurses who left is 48 - 1 (lawyer who left) = 47 nurses.

1. Calculate the cost per person for the activities:
   - Laser tag: â‚¬6
   - Pinball tokens: â‚¬4
   - Roller coaster: â‚¬10 per ride * 3 rides = â‚¬30
   - Total cost per person: â‚¬6 + â‚¬4 + â‚¬30 = â‚¬40

Each guest (including Emma) will play one round of laser tag, which costs 6 euros per guest.

Each guest will ride the roller coaster three times, which costs 10 euros per ride.
So, the total cost per guest for the roller coaster is 3 * 10 = 30 euros.

The carpenter works 6 days every week and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. However, since he works only 2 weeks every month, we'll calculate the total days worked per month as follows:

6 days/week Ã— 2 weeks/month = 12 days/month

The answer is $430.",430.0,0,"I think there's been a mistake! The question you provided doesn't match the reflection you wrote. The reflection seems to be about a problem involving pineapples and kiwis, but the question is about Ananya's vacation expenses. Let me try to answer the question correctly.

Q: Ananya went to the boardwalk for vacation. Her parents gave her $1200 to buy whatever she wanted. At the gift shop, saltwater taffy was on sale for ""Buy 16 kgs at $23 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/2 off."" She scooped up 23 kgs. She also bought a mixed bag of starfish for $11.0 and 17 keychains that were $20.0 each. Ananya then donated $5 at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Ananya have left?

A: Let's think step by step.

Ananya starts with $1200.

She buys 23 kgs of saltwater taffy. Since she buys more than 16 kgs, she gets 4 kgs at half off. The first 16 kgs cost 16 * $23 = $368. The next 4 kgs cost 4 * ($23 / 2) = $46. The remaining 3 kgs cost 3 * $23 = $69. So, the total cost of saltwater taffy is $368 + $46 + $69 = $483.

She also buys a mixed bag of starfish for $11.0.

She buys 17 keychains that were $20.0 each, so the total cost of keychains is 17 * $20 = $340.

The total cost of her purchases is $483 + $11 + $340 = $834.

She donates $5 at a charity stand, so the total amount she spends is $834 + $5 = $839.

The amount of money Ananya has left is $1200 - $839 = $361.

Let's start by calculating how much he spent on crackers and pretzels:

4 bags of crackers x 75 cents = 4 x 0.75 = $3
7 packs of pretzels x $7 = 7 x 7 = $49

Total spent on crackers and pretzels = $3 + $49 = $52

Andre spent $100 and had 3% left as change. To find out how much he actually spent, we'll calculate the change:

Change = 3% of $100 = 0.03 x $100 = $3
So, he actually spent $100 - $3 = $97

Now, subtract the amount spent on crackers and pretzels from the total amount spent:

$97 - $52 = $45

If the length of his room is 16 feet longer that its width, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?",68.0,"To solve this, let's first define the width of the room as x. The length is 16 feet longer than the width, so the length is x + 16.

The area of a rectangle is length * width. We are given that the area is 225 square feet, so we can set up the equation:

x(x + 16) = 225

Expanding this equation gives us:

x^2 + 16x = 225

Subtracting 225 from both sides gives us:

x^2 + 16x - 225 = 0

We can factor this quadratic equation:

(x + 25)(x - 9) = 0

This gives us two possible values for x: x = -25 and x = 9. Since the width cannot be negative, we know that x = 9.

So the width is 9 feet, and the length is 9 + 16 = 25 feet.

The perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width). Plugging in the values we found, we get:

The area of the room is 225 square feet.
The area of a rectangle is calculated by length * width.

So, we can write the equation: w * (w + 16) = 225.
This equation can be simplified to w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0.
Solving this quadratic equation, we get w = 9 or w = -25 (we discard -25 as width cannot be negative).
So, the width is 9 feet.
The length is w + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25 feet.
Now, we can calculate the perimeter using the formula: 2 * (length + width).

We know that in 4 years, Jasmine will be 4 times as old as James is now. James is currently 8 years old, so in 4 years, Jasmine will be 4 Ã— 8 = 32 years old.

Since Jasmine will be 32 years old in 4 years, we can find her current age by subtracting 4 from 32:

Jasmine's current age = 32 - 4 = 28 years old

**Step 2: Find James' age in 6 years**

James is currently 8 years old, so in 6 years, he will be:

James' age in 6 years = 8 + 6 = 14 years old

**Step 3: Find Jasmine's age in 6 years**

Jasmine is currently 28 years old, so in 6 years, she will be:

Jasmine's age in 6 years = 28 + 6 = 34 years old

**Step 4: Calculate the average of James and Jasmine in 6 years**

To find the average, we add their ages in 6 years and divide by 2:

Average age = (James' age in 6 years + Jasmine's age in 6 years) / 2
= (14 + 34) / 2
= 48 / 2
= 24 years old

Therefore, the average age of James and Jasmine in 6 years is 24 years old.",24.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
James is 8 years old now.
In 4 years, Jasmine will be 4 times as old as James is now, so Jasmine will be 4 * 8 = 32 years old in 4 years.
Since James is 8 years old now, in 4 years, James will be 8 + 4 = 12 years old.
However, to find the average of James and Jasmine in 6 years, we need to calculate their ages in 6 years.
In 6 years, James will be 8 + 6 = 14 years old.
Since Jasmine will be 32 years old in 4 years, in 6 years, Jasmine will be 32 + 2 = 34 years old.
Now, we can find the average of James and Jasmine in 6 years.
The sum of their ages is 14 + 34 = 48.
The average is the sum / 2 = 48 / 2 = 24.

Emma wants to make two warm jackets for herself, each needing 11 skeins of wool. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?",318.0,"To find out how many skeins of wool Emma needs, we need to calculate the total number of skeins required for the quadruplets and then add the number of skeins needed for Emma's jackets.

For each grandchild:

* Poncho: 18 skeins

* Beanie: 15 skeins
* Booties: 8 skeins
* Gloves: 16 skeins

Total number of skeins per grandchild: 18 + 17 + 15 + 8 + 16 = 74 skeins

Since there are 4 grandchildren, we multiply the total number of skeins per grandchild by 4:

74 skeins/grandchild * 4 grandchildren = 296 skeins

For Emma's jackets:

* Each jacket needs 11 skeins of wool
* Emma wants to make 2 jackets, so we multiply the number of skeins per jacket by 2:

11 skeins/jacket * 2 jackets = 22 skeins

Now, we add the total number of skeins needed for the quadruplets and Emma's jackets:

296 skeins (for the quadruplets) + 22 skeins (for Emma's jackets) = 318 skeins

First, let's calculate the time it takes Carlos to swim a kilometer on a warm day. We know that when the water is warm, Carlos swims a kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times as long as when the water is cold. We also know that when the water is cold, Carlos swims a kilometer in 11 minutes.

So, four times the time it takes Carlos to swim a kilometer on a cold day is:

4 * 11 = 44 minutes

Nine minutes more than this is:

However, this is not the correct answer. The question asks how much longer they have to get to the cinema without being late, but the given answer was based on only the information provided.

Considering that the question stated they walk to the cinema together, which usually implies they have already walked to the park (since the park is on their way to the cinema which is the destination) and the fact that the time they have left walking to the park is used to calculate the answer which is wrong, let's recalculate.

They have 229 minutes to walk to the cinema, but they wasted 32 minutes.
So, the actual time remaining for their walk is 229 - 32 = 197 minutes.

They take 22 minutes to get to the corner where the library is.
Then, they take another 29 minutes to get to the mall.
It takes them double the combined amount they have spent so far to reach the park, which is 2 * (22 + 29) = 2 * 51 = 102 minutes.
The total time spent walking to the park is 51 + 102 = 153 minutes.

They have already walked for 153 minutes.
Since they have 197 minutes left after the coffee and they walked for 153 minutes, let's subtract the minutes they have already used from their remaining time after the coffee:
197 - 153 = 44.
Then, subtract the time they spent getting coffee from the total time they have been given to walk to find their total time used so far to get to the cinema:
22 + 29 + 102 = 153 minutes walking, plus 32 minutes coffee break is 153 + 32 = 185 minutes total minutes spent so far.

229 - 185 = 44 minutes total time left, however, the question asks for how much longer they have left to reach the cinema after they've already spent 153 minutes walking to get to the park, so let's recalculate.
They spent 153 walking to the park and 32 minutes for coffee for a total of 153 + 32 = 185 minutes so far. Now, subtract this from the total time given to them.

If he makes 8 giant cubes, 24 small cubes, 15 medium cubes, and eight tiny cubes, how many grams of water does he have left?",76.0,"To find out how many grams of water Oliver has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used to make the ice cubes and subtract it from the initial amount of water (344 grams).

Let's calculate the amount of water used for each type of cube:

1. Giant cubes: 8 cubes x 12 grams/cube = 96 grams
2. Medium cubes: 15 cubes x 11 grams/cube = 165 grams
3. Small cubes: 24 cubes x 1/4 gram/cube = 24 x 0.25 = 6 grams
4. Tiny cubes: Since tiny cubes are half the size of small cubes, they use half of 1/4 gram, which is 1/8 gram. So, 8 tiny cubes x 1/8 gram/cube = 8 x 0.125 = 1 gram

Now, let's add up the total amount of water used:

96 grams (giant) + 165 grams (medium) + 6 grams (small) + 1 gram (tiny) = 268 grams

Oliver starts with 344 grams of water.

He makes 15 medium cubes, each using 11 grams of water.
So, the total water used for medium cubes is 15 * 11 = 165 grams.

He makes 24 small cubes, each using 1/4 gram of water.
So, the total water used for small cubes is 24 * 1/4 = 6 grams.

He makes 8 tiny cubes, each using half the size of small cubes, which is 1/8 gram of water.
So, the total water used for tiny cubes is 8 * 1/8 = 1 gram.

Now, let's add up the total water used for all the cubes:
96 + 165 + 6 + 1 = 268 grams.

We know that:

* 34 students like to bake
* 6 students like to play hurling
* The rest like to either paint or read

Let's start by finding the total number of students who like to paint or read. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who like to bake and play hurling from the total number of students:

160 (total students) - 34 (bake) - 6 (hurling) = 120

So, 120 students like to either paint or read.

Now, let's use the information that the number of students who like to read is 3 less than four times the number of students who prefer playing hurling. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Read = 4 Ã— Hurling - 3
Read = 4 Ã— 6 - 3
Read = 24 - 3
Read = 21

So, 21 students like to read.

Now, we can find the number of students who like to paint by subtracting the number of students who like to read from the total number of students who like to paint or read:

120 (paint or read) - 21 (read) = 99

Therefore, 99 students like to paint.",99.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Each cow eats as much as a goat and alpaca eat combined. If there are 21 goats, 7 alpacas, and 21 cows, how many kilograms of grain does Alejandro need?",798.0,"To find the total amount of grain Alejandro needs, we'll calculate the amount each type of animal needs and then multiply it by the number of animals.

1. Goats:
Each goat needs 9 kilograms of grain.
There are 21 goats, so the total amount of grain needed for goats is:
21 goats Ã— 9 kg/goat = 189 kg

2. Alpacas:
Each alpaca needs 3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs.
Twice the amount each goat needs is 2 Ã— 9 kg = 18 kg.
3 kilograms less than that is 18 kg - 3 kg = 15 kg.
There are 7 alpacas, so the total amount of grain needed for alpacas is:
7 alpacas Ã— 15 kg/alpaca = 105 kg

3. Cows:
Each cow eats as much as a goat and alpaca eat combined.
A goat eats 9 kg, and an alpaca eats 15 kg, so the total amount a cow eats is:
9 kg + 15 kg = 24 kg
There are 21 cows, so the total amount of grain needed for cows is:
21 cows Ã— 24 kg/cow = 504 kg

Now, let's add up the total amount of grain needed for all the animals:
189 kg (goats) + 105 kg (alpacas) + 504 kg (cows) = 798 kg

Alejandro needs 798 kilograms of grain.",798.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how much each animal eats.
Each goat needs 9 kilograms of grain.
Each alpaca needs 3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs. 
Twice the amount for a goat is 9 * 2 = 18 kilograms.
So, each alpaca needs 18 - 3 = 15 kilograms of grain.
Each cow eats as much as a goat and alpaca eat combined. 
So, each cow eats 9 + 15 = 24 kilograms of grain.
There are 21 goats, each eating 9 kilograms, so they eat 21 * 9 = 189 kilograms of grain.
There are 7 alpacas, each eating 15 kilograms, so they eat 7 * 15 = 105 kilograms of grain.
There are 21 cows, each eating 24 kilograms, so they eat 21 * 24 = 504 kilograms of grain.
The total amount of grain needed is 189 + 105 + 504 = 798 kilograms.

Due to the flu season, 35 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.",50.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of occupied beds**

The hospital has a capacity of 800 beds, and 1/8 of them are occupied. To find the number of occupied beds, we'll multiply the total capacity by 1/8:

 Occupied beds = 800 x 1/8
= 800 x 0.125
= 100 beds

**Step 2: Calculate the number of beds out of service**

One-fifth of all the beds are out of service. To find the number of beds out of service, we'll multiply the total capacity by 1/5:

 Beds out of service = 800 x 1/5
= 800 x 0.2
= 160 beds

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of unavailable beds**

We'll add the number of occupied beds and beds out of service to find the total number of unavailable beds:

 Unavailable beds = Occupied beds + Beds out of service
= 100 + 160
= 260 beds

**Step 4: Calculate the initial number of unoccupied beds**

We'll subtract the number of unavailable beds from the total capacity to find the initial number of unoccupied beds:

 Initial unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Unavailable beds
= 800 - 260
= 540 beds

**Step 5: Calculate the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks**

The hospital admits 35 patients per day. To find the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks (14 days), we'll multiply the daily admission rate by 14:

 Patients admitted in 2 weeks = 35 x 14
= 490 patients

**Step 6: Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks**

We'll subtract the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks from the initial number of unoccupied beds:

 Total unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = Initial unoccupied beds - Patients admitted in 2 weeks
= 540 - 490
= 50 beds

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 50.",50.0,1,"A: Let's think step by step.
The hospital has a capacity of 800 beds.
One-eighth of the beds are occupied, so the number of occupied beds is 800 * 1/8 = 100 beds.

The total number of beds that are either occupied or out of service is 100 + 160 = 260 beds.
The number of available beds is 800 - 260 = 540 beds.
35 patients are admitted each day, and this goes on for 2 weeks (14 days), so the total number of admitted patients is 35 * 14 = 490 patients.
After admitting these patients, the number of unoccupied beds is 540 - 490 = 50 beds.

If the cupcake cost â‚º10 and the orange pie cost â‚º22, how much was Andre's average daily earning?",980.0,"To find the average daily earnings, we need to calculate the total earnings for each day and then the total earnings for the three days. 

On Monday, Andre sold 24 boxes of cupcakes and 16 fewer boxes of orange pie than on Tuesday. On Tuesday, he sold 28 boxes of orange pie. So on Monday, he sold 28 - 16 = 12 boxes of orange pie.

On Monday:
- Cupcakes: 24 boxes * â‚º10 = â‚º240
- Orange pies: 12 boxes * â‚º22 = â‚º264
- Total earnings on Monday = â‚º240 + â‚º264 = â‚º504

On Tuesday:
- Cupcakes: 24 + 11 = 35 boxes * â‚º10 = â‚º350
- Orange pies: 28 boxes * â‚º22 = â‚º616
- Total earnings on Tuesday = â‚º350 + â‚º616 = â‚º966

On Wednesday, Andre sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. So the total earnings on Wednesday is the sum of the total earnings on Monday and Tuesday.
- Total earnings on Wednesday = â‚º504 + â‚º966 = â‚º1470

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for the three days:
- Total earnings = â‚º504 + â‚º966 + â‚º1470 = â‚º2940

To find the average daily earnings, we divide the total earnings by 3:
- Average daily earnings = â‚º2940 / 3 = â‚º980",980.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

To find Andre's average daily earnings, we need to find out how many cupcakes and orange pies he sold each day and the total amount of money he made.

On Monday, he sold 24 boxes of cupcakes. Let's call the number of orange pies he sold on Monday x. Then, on Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday, which is 24 + 11 = 35 boxes. He also sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pie than on Monday, so the number of orange pies he sold on Tuesday is x - 16. However, we know that on Tuesday, he sold 28 boxes of orange pie. Therefore, x - 16 = 28. Solving for x, we get x = 44. So, on Monday, he sold 44 boxes of orange pie.

Now that we have the number of cupcakes and orange pies sold on Monday and Tuesday, we can find the total number of cupcakes and orange pies sold on Wednesday. Since he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined, the total number of cupcakes sold on Wednesday is 24 + 35 = 59 boxes, and the total number of orange pies sold on Wednesday is 44 + 28 = 72 boxes.

Now, let's find the total amount of money Andre made each day. On Monday, he sold 24 boxes of cupcakes at â‚º10 each and 44 boxes of orange pie at â‚º22 each. So, the total amount of money he made on Monday is (24 * 10) + (44 * 22) = 240 + 968 = 1208.

On Tuesday, he sold 35 boxes of cupcakes at â‚º10 each and 28 boxes of orange pie at â‚º22 each. So, the total amount of money he made on Tuesday is (35 * 10) + (28 * 22) = 350 + 616 = 966.

On Wednesday, he sold 59 boxes of cupcakes at â‚º10 each and 72 boxes of orange pie at â‚º22 each. So, the total amount of money he made on Wednesday is (59 * 10) + (72 * 22) = 590 + 1584 = 2174.

Now, let's find the total amount of money Andre made in three days. The total amount is 1208 + 966 + 2174 = 4348.

Finally, to find the average daily earnings, we divide the total amount of money by the number of days, which is 3. The average daily earnings is 4348 / 3 = 1449.33.

The answer is 1449.33.",1449.33,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's find out how many boxes of cupcakes and orange pies Andre sold on Monday and Tuesday.

On Tuesday, Andre sold 28 boxes of orange pie.
On Monday, he sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pie than on Tuesday.
So, the number of boxes of orange pie sold on Monday is 28 - 16 = 12.

On Tuesday, Andre sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday.
Let's call the number of boxes of cupcakes sold on Monday ""x"".
Then, the number of boxes of cupcakes sold on Tuesday is x + 11.

We know that Andre sold 24 boxes of cupcakes on Monday.
So, x = 24.

The number of boxes of cupcakes sold on Tuesday is 24 + 11 = 35.

Now, let's find out how many boxes of cupcakes and orange pies Andre sold on Wednesday.
On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined.
So, the number of boxes of cupcakes sold on Wednesday is 24 + 35 = 59.
The number of boxes of orange pie sold on Wednesday is 12 + 28 = 40.

Now, let's calculate Andre's total earnings.
The total number of boxes of cupcakes sold is 24 + 35 + 59 = 118.
The total number of boxes of orange pie sold is 12 + 28 + 40 = 80.

The total earnings from cupcakes is 118 * â‚º10 = â‚º1180.
The total earnings from orange pie is 80 * â‚º22 = â‚º1760.

The total earnings is â‚º1180 + â‚º1760 = â‚º2940.

The average daily earning is â‚º2940 / 3 = â‚º980.

How much money will Mei spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",22.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total space required for each plant**

Each plant is 3 feet wide, and Mei needs to leave 13 feet between every plant. So, the total space required for each plant is:
3 feet (plant width) + 13 feet (space between plants) = 16 feet

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of plants Mei can fit in her flower bed**

Mei's flower bed is 143 feet long. To find out how many plants she can fit, we'll divide the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:
143 feet (flower bed length) Ã· 16 feet (space per plant) = 8.94 (round down to 8, since we can't have a fraction of a plant)

However, Mei already owns 8 flowers, so she needs to buy more plants to fill the remaining space. Let's recalculate the number of plants she needs to buy:
143 feet (flower bed length) Ã· 16 feet (space per plant) = 8.94 (round down to 8)
Since Mei already has 8 plants, she needs to buy:
8 (total plants needed) - 8 (plants Mei already owns) = 0 ( wait, this can't be right!)

Let's re-examine the calculation:
143 feet (flower bed length) Ã· 16 feet (space per plant) = 8.94 (round down to 9, since we can't have a fraction of a plant)
Since Mei already has 8 plants, she needs to buy:
9 (total plants needed) - 8 (plants Mei already owns) = 1 (no, this can't be right either!)

Let's try again:
143 feet (flower bed length) Ã· 16 feet (space per plant) = 8.94 (round up to 9, since we can't have a fraction of a plant)
Since Mei already has 8 plants, she needs to buy:
9 (total plants needed) - 8 (plants Mei already owns) = 1 (still not right...)

Okay, let's think about this... If Mei already has 8 plants, and she needs to leave 13 feet between every plant, she can fit one more plant at the end of the flower bed. So, she needs to buy:
1 more plant

Each plant costs â‚¬9. Mei needs to buy 1 more plant, so the total cost is:
1 plant Ã— â‚¬9 per plant = â‚¬9

However, Mei is buying more than 2 plants in total (she already has 8 and is buying 1 more), so she'll receive a â‚¬5 discount on the entire purchase. Since she's only buying 1 more plant, the discount will be applied to this single purchase:

Mei already has 8 flowers, so she needs to fill the remaining space.
The total space available is 143 feet.
The space taken up by the 8 flowers she already has is 8 * 16 = 128 feet.
However, this is not correct, since the 8 flowers she already has will take up 8 * 3 = 24 feet for the flowers themselves, and 7 * 13 = 91 feet for the spaces between them (since there are 7 spaces between 8 flowers).
So, the total space taken up by the 8 flowers she already has is 24 + 91 = 115 feet.
The remaining space is 143 - 115 = 28 feet.
Since each plant takes up 16 feet of space, Mei can fit 28 / 16 = 1.75 plants in the remaining space.
However, since Mei can't buy a fraction of a plant, she will need to buy 2 more plants to fill up the remaining space.

Each plant costs â‚¬9, and Mei needs to buy 2 more plants.

**Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to peel 60 clams**

Yara can peel 6 clams per minute. To find the time it takes to peel 60 clams, we can divide the number of clams by the rate at which she peels them:

60 clams / 6 clams per minute = 10 minutes

**Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to saute 60 clams**

Yara can saute 20 clams in 8 minutes. To find the time it takes to saute 60 clams, we can multiply the time it takes to saute 20 clams by the number of batches of 20 clams:

3 batches x 8 minutes per batch = 24 minutes

**Step 3: Add the time it takes to wash all the clams**

It takes 19 minutes to wash all the clams.

**Step 4: Add up the total time**

Now, let's add up the time it takes to peel, saute, and wash the clams:

Therefore, it will take Yara 53 minutes to peel, saute, and wash 60 clams.",60.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

To peel 60 clams, we need to divide the total clams by the number of clams Yara can peel per minute. 
Yara peels 6 clams per minute.
So, the time it takes to peel 60 clams is 60 / 6 = 10 minutes.
 
To saute 60 clams, we need to divide the total clams by the number of clams Yara can saute in 8 minutes. 
Yara sautes 20 clams in 8 minutes.
So, the number of minutes per 20 clams is 8 minutes.
The number of sets of 20 clams in 60 clams is 60 / 20 = 3 sets.
So, the time it takes to saute 60 clams is 3 * 8 = 24 minutes.

The total time it takes to peel and saute the clams is the time to peel, plus the time to saute, plus the time to wash.

1. Find the amount of ore each miner can mine in a day with a bronze pickaxe:
   - One miner can mine 5 pounds of ore per day with a basic shovel.
   - With a bronze pickaxe, one miner can mine twice as much: 2 * 5 = 10 pounds per day.

2. Find the amount of ore each miner can mine in a day with a diamond pickaxe:
   - With a diamond pickaxe, one miner can mine 80% more than with a bronze pickaxe.

Let's say Ananya gets x yards of fence.

Since Tara gets 190 yards more than Ananya, Tara gets x + 190 yards.

Umar gets 30 yards more than Tara, so Umar gets (x + 190) + 30 = x + 220 yards.

2. Preparation time: Santiago spends 15 minutes before each class to review and prepare. He has 9 classes per day, so he spends 9 * 15 = 135 minutes per day preparing for classes.

3. Extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday: Santiago spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes on each Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.

On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?",75.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Find Olivia's original speed on the beach and sidewalk**

Let's denote Olivia's original speed on the beach as x km/min. Since she walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her original speed on the sidewalk is 4x km/min.

**Step 2: Calculate Olivia's new speed on the beach and sidewalk after the injury**

Since Olivia's speed has decreased by half due to the injury, her new speed on the beach is x/2 km/min, and her new speed on the sidewalk is 4x/2 = 2x km/min.

**Step 3: Calculate the time spent walking on the beach**

We know that Olivia spends 60 minutes walking on the beach, and she covers a distance of 10 kilometers. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Substituting the values, we get:

60 = 10 / (x/2)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x/2 = 10/60 = 1/6

x = 1/3

So, Olivia's original speed on the beach is 1/3 km/min, and her new speed on the beach is 1/6 km/min.

**Step 4: Calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk**

We know that Olivia walks 10 kilometers on the sidewalk at a speed of 2x km/min. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Substituting the values, we get:

Time = 10 / (2x)

Substituting x = 1/3, we get:

Time = 10 / (2/3) = 10 / (2/3) = 15 minutes

**Step 5: Calculate the total time spent walking**

The total time spent walking is the sum of the time spent walking on the beach and the time spent walking on the sidewalk:

Total Time = 60 + 15 = 75 minutes

Therefore, it takes Olivia 75 minutes to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk.",20.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Olivia walks 10 kilometers on the beach and 10 kilometers on the sidewalk.
She walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.
However, her speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk.

First, let's find her original speed on the beach. Since she walks 10 kilometers on the beach in 60 minutes, her original speed on the beach is 10 km / 60 min = 1/6 km/min.

Since her speed has decreased by half, her new speed on the beach is 1/2 * 1/6 km/min = 1/12 km/min.

Her original speed on the sidewalk is four times her original speed on the beach, which is 4 * 1/6 km/min = 2/3 km/min.

Since her speed has decreased by half, her new speed on the sidewalk is 1/2 * 2/3 km/min = 1/3 km/min.

Now, let's find the time it takes for her to walk 10 kilometers on the sidewalk at her new speed. Time = Distance / Speed = 10 km / (1/3 km/min) = 30 minutes.

So, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk is the time spent on the beach (60 minutes) plus the time spent on the sidewalk (30 minutes). Total time = 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

The answer is 90.",90.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Olivia walks 20 kilometers every day, with 10 kilometers on the beach and 10 kilometers on the sidewalk.

She walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, but her speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk.

First, let's find her original speed on the beach. Let's call this speed x.

Since the speed on the sidewalk is four times the speed on the beach, her speed on the sidewalk is 4x.

After the injury, her speed on the beach becomes 0.5x and her speed on the sidewalk becomes 0.5 * 4x = 2x.

We know that she spends 60 minutes walking on the beach. Since distance = speed * time, we can find her speed on the beach:

10 km = 0.5x * 60 minutes

To find the speed, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours (60 minutes = 1 hour).

10 km = 0.5x * 1 hour
0.5x = 10 km/hour
x = 20 km/hour (original speed on the beach)

Now we can find the time spent on the sidewalk. The speed on the sidewalk is 2x = 2 * 20/2 = 20 km/hour (after injury).

Time = distance / speed
Time on sidewalk = 10 km / 20 km/hour
Time on sidewalk = 0.5 hours
Time on sidewalk = 0.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes

The total time for the entire walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk.

Total time = 60 minutes (beach) + 30 minutes (sidewalk)

Arjun eats 3 pancakes a day for 57 days:
3 pancakes/day x 57 days = 171 pancakes

Then, he eats 9 pancakes a day for the remaining days:
70 days - 57 days = 13 days
9 pancakes/day x 13 days = 117 pancakes

Total pancakes eaten:
171 pancakes + 117 pancakes = 288 pancakes

Arjun has already eaten for 57 days, so he will eat for 70 - 57 = 13 more days.

So, he ate 9 * 13 = 117 pancakes in the next 13 days.
In total, he ate 171 + 117 = 288 pancakes.

The first 2 have 300 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes is 2 * 300 = 600.
The last complex is 50% bigger than the other 2 combined, so it has 600 + (50% of 600) = 600 + 300 = 900 apartments.
The total number of apartments is 600 + 900 = 1500.

Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each place, so he collects garbage 2 * 3 = 6 times a week.
He gets paid Â¥0.45 per collection for each apartment, so he earns Â¥0.45 * 1500 = Â¥675 per collection.
Since he collects garbage 6 times a week, his total earnings per week is Â¥675 * 6 = Â¥4050.

He also earns 14% on tips, so his total earnings from tips is Â¥4050 * 0.14 = Â¥567.
His total earnings per week is Â¥4050 + Â¥567 = Â¥4617.
