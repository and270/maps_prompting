She bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, and 60 mini cheesecakes. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,"To find the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen, we need to first calculate the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes, and then subtract that from the total amount Sophia paid.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the donuts.
60 donuts / 12 = 5 dozen donuts
Cost of donuts = 5 dozen x $19 per dozen = $95

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes.
60 mini cupcakes / 12 = 5 dozen mini cupcakes
Cost of mini cupcakes = 5 dozen x $33 per dozen = $165

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes.
Total cost of donuts and mini cupcakes = $95 + $165 = $260

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of all the pastries before the discount.
Let's call the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen ""x"".
Total cost of all pastries = $260 + 5x (since there are 60 mini cheesecakes, which is 5 dozen)

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of all the pastries after the 20% discount.
Total cost after discount = $1500
Since there was a 20% discount, the original total cost was $1500 / 0.8 = $1875

Step 6: Set up an equation to solve for x.
$260 + 5x = $1875

Step 7: Solve for x.
5x = $1875 - $260
5x = $1615
x = $1615 / 5
x = $323

So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen is $323.",323.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes. 
60 donuts is 5 dozen donuts (60 / 12 = 5). 
The cost of the donuts is 5 * $19 = $95.

60 mini cupcakes is 5 dozen mini cupcakes (60 / 12 = 5). 
The cost of the mini cupcakes is 5 * $33 = $165.

So, the total cost of the donuts and cupcakes is $95 + $165 = $260.

Now, we know the total cost after the 20% discount is $1500, so we can find the original total cost before the discount. 
Let's call the cost of the mini cheesecakes 'x'. Then, the original total cost is $260 + x. 
We know that this amount after a 20% discount is $1500. 
To find the original amount, we can divide $1500 by 0.8 (since 100% - 20% = 80%, which is 0.8 as a decimal). 
The original total cost is $1500 / 0.8 = $1875.

Now, we can find the cost of the mini cheesecakes by subtracting the cost of the donuts and cupcakes from the original total cost. 
The cost of the mini cheesecakes is $1875 - $260 = $1615.

Since Sophia bought 60 mini cheesecakes, which is 5 dozen mini cheesecakes, 
we can find the cost per dozen by dividing $1615 by 5. 
The cost per dozen is $1615 / 5 = $323.

The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?",350.0,"To find out how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for both of them and subtract the calories they've already consumed. 

Hiroshi's daily calorie target is 220 * 15 = 3300 calories.
He's already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 through exercise, so the net calories he's consumed is 1100 - 200 = 900 calories. 
He can still consume 3300 - 900 = 2400 calories.

Tara's daily calorie target is 140 * 15 = 2100 calories.
She's already consumed 900 + 200 = 1100 calories. 
She can still consume 2100 - 1100 = 1000 calories.

Since the bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving, we can calculate the number of servings each person can consume:

Hiroshi can consume 2400 / 200 = 12 servings.
Tara can consume 1000 / 200 = 5 servings.

Since the 300 grams bag has 6 servings, we can calculate the number of grams per serving:

300 grams / 6 servings = 50 grams per serving.

Hiroshi needs 12 servings * 50 grams per serving = 600 grams of popcorn.
Tara needs 5 servings * 50 grams per serving = 250 grams of popcorn.

Hiroshi needs to consume 600 - 250 = 350 grams more than Tara.

The answer is 350 grams.",350.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Hiroshi and Tara.
Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, so his daily calorie target is 220 * 15 = 3300 calories.
Tara weighs 140 lbs, so her daily calorie target is 140 * 15 = 2100 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many calories Hiroshi and Tara have already consumed.
Hiroshi has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise, so his net calorie intake is 1100 - 200 = 900 calories.
Tara has already consumed 900 calories in food and 200 calories in ice cream, so her total calorie intake is 900 + 200 = 1100 calories.

Now, we need to calculate how many calories Hiroshi and Tara can still consume.
Hiroshi's daily calorie target is 3300 calories, and he has already consumed 900 calories, so he can still consume 3300 - 900 = 2400 calories.
Tara's daily calorie target is 2100 calories, and she has already consumed 1100 calories, so she can still consume 2100 - 1100 = 1000 calories.

Since a serving of popcorn has 200 calories, we can calculate how many servings Hiroshi and Tara can still consume.
Hiroshi can still consume 2400 / 200 = 12 servings.
Tara can still consume 1000 / 200 = 5 servings.

Since a 300 grams bag has 6 servings, we can calculate how many grams of popcorn Hiroshi and Tara can still consume.
Hiroshi can still consume 12 servings, which is equivalent to (12 / 6) * 300 = 600 grams.
Tara can still consume 5 servings, which is equivalent to (5 / 6) * 300 = 250 grams.

Finally, we can calculate how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara.
Hiroshi needs to consume 600 grams, and Tara needs to consume 250 grams, so Hiroshi needs to consume 600 - 250 = 350 grams more than Tara.

Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Daphne remain with?",335.0,"To find out how many potted plants Daphne will remain with, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Daphne received 23 new potted plants two days ago.

Initial plants = 23

2. She already has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges.

Existing plants = 8 * 56 = 448

Total plants (before yesterday's purchase) = Initial plants + Existing plants
= 23 + 448
= 471

3. Yesterday, Daphne purchased 200 new plants at a 50% discount. Since the price doesn't affect the number of plants, we can directly add the new plants.

New plants purchased = 200

Total plants (after yesterday's purchase) = Total plants (before yesterday's purchase) + New plants purchased
= 471 + 200
= 671

4. Daphne will give away 6 potted plants from each of the 56 window ledges. Since she already had 8 plants on each ledge, she can give away 6 plants from each ledge without running out.

Plants given away = 6 * 56 = 336

5. To find out how many potted plants Daphne will remain with, subtract the plants given away from the total plants after yesterday's purchase.

Remaining plants = Total plants (after yesterday's purchase) - Plants given away
= 671 - 336
= 335

Daphne will remain with 335 potted plants.",335.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Daphne already has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges.
So, the total number of potted plants she already has is 8 * 56 = 448.

So, the total number of potted plants now is 448 + 23 = 471.

Yesterday, she purchased 200 new plants at a 50% discount.
Since the discount is 50%, she paid for half of the plants, but she still got all 200 plants.
So, the total number of potted plants now is 471 + 200 = 671.

Tomorrow, she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family.

However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the initial rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

We know that it takes 60 minutes to cover every 4 miles of the city. So, the initial rate is:

4 miles / 60 minutes = 1/15 miles per minute

Step 2: Determine the distance that needs to be covered to cover 1/4 of the city.

The city is 80 miles across, and we want to cover 1/4 of it. So, the distance is:

80 miles / 4 = 20 miles

Step 3: Calculate the time it would take to cover 20 miles at the initial rate.

We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Rate

Time = 20 miles / (1/15 miles per minute)
Time = 20 miles x 15 minutes/mile
Time = 300 minutes

However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour, which means the rate at which the fog bank covers the city will also be halved. Since we're interested in the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city, which is less than 1 hour, we can assume the initial rate is still applicable for this part of the journey.

Therefore, the time it will take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city is:

300 minutes x (4 miles / 20 miles) = 60 minutes

So, it will take 60 minutes for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city.",4.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
First, we need to figure out how many miles is 1/4 of the city. 
Since the city is 80 miles across, 1/4 of the city is 80 / 4 = 20 miles.
It takes 60 minutes to cover every 4 miles of the city.
So, to cover 20 miles, it would take (20 / 4) * 60 = 5 * 60 = 300 minutes at the original speed.
However, we are told that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour, which is 60 minutes. 
Since the time it takes is directly proportional to the wind speed, the time it takes to cover the same distance will be doubled after the wind speed is halved. 
Since we are looking at a time period of 300 minutes, which is 5 hours, and the wind speed will be halved in one hour, the first 4 miles will take 60 minutes, and the remaining 16 miles will take (16 / 4) * 120 = 4 * 120 = 480 minutes.
So, the total time to cover 1/4 of the city is 60 + 480 = 540 minutes.

On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 2-hour episodes. On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?",6.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total hours of TV watched on Tuesday and Wednesday**
Santiago watched 4-hour episodes on both Tuesday and Wednesday, so the total hours watched on these two days is:
4 hours/day × 2 days = 8 hours

**Step 2: Calculate the total hours of TV watched on Friday**
Santiago watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show on Friday. Convert the 45-minute show to hours:
45 minutes ÷ 60 = 0.75 hours
Total hours watched on Friday = 3 hours + 0.75 hours = 3.75 hours

**Step 3: Calculate the total hours of TV watched on Saturday**
Santiago watched three 2-hour episodes on Saturday, so the total hours watched is:
3 episodes × 2 hours/episode = 6 hours

**Step 4: Calculate the total hours of TV watched on Sunday**
Santiago watched three 15-minute episodes on Sunday. Convert the total minutes to hours:
3 episodes × 15 minutes/episode = 45 minutes
45 minutes ÷ 60 = 0.75 hours

**Step 5: Calculate the total hours of TV watched on all days except Thursday**
Add up the hours watched on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:
8 hours + 3.75 hours + 6 hours + 0.75 hours = 18.5 hours

**Step 6: Calculate the hours of TV watched on Thursday**
Since Santiago watched a total of 20 hours of TV, subtract the hours watched on all other days from the total:
20 hours - 18.5 hours = 1.5 hours

**Step 7: Calculate the number of 15-minute episodes watched on Thursday**
Since each episode is 15 minutes, convert the hours watched on Thursday to minutes:
1.5 hours × 60 = 90 minutes
Now, divide the total minutes by the length of each episode:
90 minutes ÷ 15 minutes/episode = 6 episodes

Therefore, Santiago watched **6** 15-minute episodes on Thursday.",15.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the total number of hours Santiago watched TV, excluding Thursday and Sunday, since we're trying to find out how many 15-minute episodes he watched on Thursday.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, he watched 4-hour episodes each night, so that's 4 + 4 = 8 hours.
On Friday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show, which we need to convert to hours. 45 minutes is 45 / 60 = 0.75 hours. So, he watched 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours on Friday.
On Saturday, he watched three 2-hour episodes, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 hours.
So, in total, excluding Thursday and Sunday, he watched 8 + 3.75 + 6 = 17.75 hours.
We know he watched a total of 20 hours, so we subtract the hours we already calculated from the total to find the hours watched on Thursday and Sunday. 20 - 17.75 = 2.25 hours.
Now, we need to find out how many of these hours were watched on Thursday. We know that on Sunday, he watched three 15-minute episodes, which is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes, or 45 / 60 = 0.75 hours. So, the hours watched on Thursday are 2.25 - 0.75 = 1.5 hours.
Since we're asked about the number of 15-minute episodes on Thursday, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes, which is 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes. Then, we divide this by 15 minutes per episode to find the number of episodes: 90 / 15 = 6 episodes.

She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.

Given:
- The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 54:27.
- 8 tablespoons of milk are used for every 8 cups of water.
- 2 tablespoons of heavy cream are used for every teaspoon of sugar.

First, let's simplify the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water:
54:27 = 2:1 (simplified ratio)

Since the ratio is 2:1, for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, 1 cup of water is used.

Now, let's use the information given to set up an equation. We'll let x be the number of ""units"" of the ratio (2 teaspoons of sugar and 1 cup of water). We'll also use the fact that 8 tablespoons of milk are used for every 8 cups of water, and 2 tablespoons of heavy cream are used for every teaspoon of sugar.

Number of teaspoons of sugar = 2x
Number of cups of water = x
Number of tablespoons of milk = (8/8)x = x (since 8 cups of water are used with 8 tablespoons of milk)
Number of tablespoons of heavy cream = 2(2x) = 4x (since 2 tablespoons of heavy cream are used for every teaspoon of sugar)

We are given that the total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is 240.

So, we can set up the following equation:
2x + x + x + 4x = 240

Combine like terms:
8x = 240

Divide both sides by 8:
x = 30

Now that we know x is 30, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar:
Number of teaspoons of sugar = 2x

So Nia used 60 teaspoons of sugar.",60.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

We know that Nia uses teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 54:27. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both numbers by 9, which gives us 6:3.

We also know that she uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, which means the ratio of cups of water to tablespoons of milk is 8:8 or 1:1.

Additionally, she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar, which means the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to tablespoons of cream is 1:2.

Let's say the number of teaspoons of sugar is 6x, the number of cups of water is 3x, the number of tablespoons of milk is 3x (since it's 1:1 with cups of water), and the number of tablespoons of cream is 12x (since it's 2:1 with teaspoons of sugar).

We know that the total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is 240. So, we can set up the equation:

6x + 3x + 12x + 3x = 240

Combine like terms:

24x = 240

Divide both sides by 24:

x = 10

In the span of two years, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?",1764.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bananas and apricots Ravi harvests in two years.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of bananas per square yard**

There are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard. To find the number of bananas per square yard, we can multiply 36 by 5/4:

36 bananas / (4/5) square yard = 36 x 5/4 = 45 bananas per square yard

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of bananas harvested in two years**

Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field, and he can harvest bananas every 4 months. In two years, there are 6 harvests (2 years x 3 harvests per year).

Total bananas harvested = 10 square yards x 45 bananas/square yard x 6 harvests

First, we need to find the total number of bananas Ravi can harvest in 2 years. 
Since Ravi can harvest bananas every 4 months, he can harvest them 6 times in 2 years.

The area of the banana field is 10 square yards, but bananas are produced only in four-fifths of this area.
Four-fifths of 10 square yards is (4/5) * 10 = 8 square yards.

There are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard, so in 1 square yard, there are 36 / (4/5) = 45 bananas.
In 8 square yards, there are 8 * 45 = 360 bananas.
Since Ravi can harvest bananas 6 times in 2 years, he can harvest a total of 6 * 360 = 2160 bananas.

Next, we need to find the total number of apricots Ravi can harvest in 2 years.
Since Ravi can harvest apricots every 4 months, he can harvest them 6 times in 2 years.

The area of the apricot field is 13 square yards.
There are 12 apricots per square yard, so in 13 square yards, there are 13 * 12 = 156 apricots.
Since Ravi can harvest apricots 6 times in 2 years, he can harvest a total of 6 * 156 = 936 apricots.

Now, we can find the difference between the total number of bananas and apricots Ravi can harvest in 2 years.
The difference is 2160 - 936 = 1224.
The answer is 1224.",1224.0,0

He bought 12 folders which cost $4.75 each, 8 erasers which cost $14.5 each, and a ream of bond paper which cost $11. He also bought 7 pencils which cost $8 each. Arjun can either pay a one-time $20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases, or not become a member and receive only a 5% discount. What is the least amount Arjun can spend on everything?",212.0,"To find the least amount Arjun can spend, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the discounts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the items**

* 12 folders x $4.75 = $57.00
* 8 erasers x $14.50 = $116.00
* 1 ream of bond paper = $11.00
* 7 pencils x $8.00 = $56.00

Total cost = $57.00 + $116.00 + $11.00 + $56.00 = $240.00

**Step 2: Calculate the cost with the 5% discount (no membership)**

Discount = 5% of $240.00 = 0.05 x $240.00 = $12.00
Cost with 5% discount = $240.00 - $12.00 = $228.00

**Step 3: Calculate the cost with the 20% discount (with membership)**

Membership fee = $20.00
Discount = 20% of $240.00 = 0.20 x $240.00 = $48.00
Cost with 20% discount = $240.00 - $48.00 = $192.00
Total cost with membership = $192.00 + $20.00 = $212.00

**Step 4: Compare the costs**

Cost with 5% discount = $228.00
Cost with 20% discount (with membership) = $212.00

Since $212.00 is less than $228.00, the least amount Arjun can spend on everything is $212.00, which is the cost with the 20% discount and the membership fee.",20.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Arjun bought:

12 folders cost $4.75 each, so the total cost is 12 * $4.75 = $57.
8 erasers cost $14.5 each, so the total cost is 8 * $14.5 = $116.
The ream of bond paper costs $11.
7 pencils cost $8 each, so the total cost is 7 * $8 = $56.

The total cost of all items is $57 + $116 + $11 + $56 = $240.

Now, let's consider the two options:

Option 1: Arjun becomes a member and pays a one-time fee of $20. He gets a 20% discount on all purchases.

The total discount is 20% of $240, which is 0.20 * $240 = $48.
The total cost after discount is $240 - $48 = $192.
Adding the membership fee, the total amount Arjun pays is $192 + $20 = $212.

Option 2: Arjun does not become a member and gets a 5% discount on all purchases.

The total discount is 5% of $240, which is 0.05 * $240 = $12.
The total cost after discount is $240 - $12 = $228.

Comparing the two options, we can see that Arjun can save more money by becoming a member and paying the one-time fee.

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"Yusuf is rolling a twenty-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row, than that he rolls four even numbers in a row?",50.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then find the difference between them.

**Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row**

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a twenty-sided die is:

15/20 = 3/4 (since there are 15 numbers greater than 5 out of 20 possible outcomes)

To roll a number greater than 5 twice in a row, we need to multiply the probability by itself:

(3/4) × (3/4) = 9/16

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(9/16) × 100 = 56.25%

**Event 2: Rolling four even numbers in a row**

The probability of rolling an even number on a twenty-sided die is:

10/20 = 1/2 (since there are 10 even numbers out of 20 possible outcomes)

To roll four even numbers in a row, we need to multiply the probability by itself four times:

(1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/16

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(1/16) × 100 = 6.25%

**Difference in percentage points**

Now, we subtract the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row:

56.25% - 6.25% = 50%

So, it is 50 percentage points more likely that Yusuf rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row than that he rolls four even numbers in a row.",5.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
First, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row. 
The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is 14/20, since there are 14 numbers greater than 5 on a twenty-sided die. 
The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is (14/20) * (14/20) = 196/400 = 0.49 or 49%.
Next, we need to calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row. 
The probability of rolling an even number is 10/20, since there are 10 even numbers on a twenty-sided die. 
The probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is (10/20) * (10/20) * (10/20) * (10/20) = 10000/160000 = 0.0625 or 6.25%.
Now, we can find the difference between the two probabilities: 49% - 6.25% = 42.75%.
The answer is 42.75%.",42.75,0,"Q: Yusuf is rolling a twenty-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row, than that he rolls four even numbers in a row?
A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row. 
The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a 20-sided die is 14/20 = 0.7.
Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is 0.7 * 0.7 = 0.49.
To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.49 * 100 = 49%.

Next, we need to calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row.
The probability of rolling an even number on a 20-sided die is 10/20 = 0.5.
Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.0625.
To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.0625 * 100 = 6.25%.

Now, we can find the difference in percentage points between the two probabilities: 49% - 6.25% = 42.75%.
The answer is 42.75.",42.75,0
gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"Mia went to her greenhouse to pick some blueberries and found 2/3 as many beetles as bees in the plot. Mia then found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. In addition, she saw 24 wasps, and 9 bees. What percentage of animals in the plot were rabbits?",20.0,"To find the percentage of animals that were rabbits, we need to first find the total number of animals in the plot. Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that there were 9 bees.
2. We know that there were 2/3 as many beetles as bees. To find the number of beetles, we can multiply the number of bees by 2/3:

Beetles = (2/3) × 9 = 6

So, there were 6 beetles.

3. We know that there were 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. To find the number of rabbits, we can divide the total number of white animals by 2:

Rabbits = 26 ÷ 2 = 13

So, there were 13 rabbits.

4. We know that there were 24 wasps.

5. Now, let's add up the total number of animals in the plot:

Total animals = Bees + Beetles + Rabbits + Wasps
= 9 + 6 + 13 + 24
= 52

6. Finally, we can find the percentage of animals that were rabbits by dividing the number of rabbits by the total number of animals and multiplying by 100:

Percentage of rabbits = (13 ÷ 52) × 100
= 25%

Therefore, 25% of the animals in the plot were rabbits.",25.0,0,"## 1. Mia went to her greenhouse to pick some blueberries and found 2/3 as many beetles as bees in the plot.

Mia found 2/3 as many beetles as bees in the plot. Since she saw 9 bees, the number of beetles is 2/3 * 9 = 6.

Mia then found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. So, the number of rabbits is 26 / 2 = 13.

In addition, she saw 24 wasps.

The total number of animals in the plot is the sum of the number of beetles, bees, wasps, and rabbits: 6 + 9 + 24 + 13 = 52.

The percentage of animals in the plot that were rabbits is the number of rabbits divided by the total number of animals, multiplied by 100: (13 / 52) * 100 = 25%.

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"Mrs. Lee is looking for a new townhouse that will not go beyond her $340000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $400000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?",11000.0,"To find out the total cost of the townhouse, we need to calculate the selling price after the discount, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee.


1. Selling price after the discount:
   The original selling price is $400000. Since Mrs. Lee can get a 25% discount, we can calculate the discount amount as follows:
   Discount = 25% of $400000
            = 0.25 * $400000
            = $100000

   The selling price after the discount is:
   $400000 - $100000
   = $300000


2. Brokerage fee:
   The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   Brokerage fee = 5% of $300000
                  = 0.05 * $300000
                  = $15000


3. Transfer fee:
   The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.
   Transfer fee = 12% of $300000
                 = 0.12 * $300000
                 = $36000


4. Total cost:
   The total cost is the sum of the selling price after the discount, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee.
   Total cost = $300000 + $15000 + $36000
               = $300000 + $51000
               = $351000


5. Difference from the budget:
   To find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Lee's budget, we subtract the budget from the total cost.
   Difference = Total cost - Budget
               = $351000 - $340000

The discounted price is $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 12% of $400,000 = 0.12 * $400,000 = $48,000.

The total cost is the discounted price + brokerage fee + transfer fee = $300,000 + $20,000 + $48,000 = $368,000.

Mrs. Lee's budget is $340,000.

**Step 1: Calculate the net proceeds from the sale of the villa**

Selling price of the villa = $550,000

Legal fees = 2% of $550,000 = 0.02 x $550,000 = $11,000

Realtor fee = 5% of $550,000 = 0.05 x $550,000 = $27,500

Total fees = $11,000 + $27,500 = $38,500

Remaining loan amount = $440,000

Closing costs = $5,000

Total deductions = $38,500 + $440,000 + $5,000 = $483,500

Net proceeds from the sale of the villa = $550,000 - $483,500 = $66,500

**Step 2: Calculate the gain from the stock investment**

Net proceeds invested in stocks = $66,500

Annual gain = 10% of $66,500 = 0.10 x $66,500 = $6,650

Gain after 1 year = $66,500 + $6,650 = $73,150

Gain after 2 years = $73,150 + (10% of $73,150) = $73,150 + $7,315 = $80,465

We know there are 16 girls in the park. We also know that there are one-fourth the number of boys in the park, which means the number of boys is 1/4 of the number of girls.

12 kg (apples) + 72 kg (cucumbers) + 1326 kg (hay) + 340 kg (corn) + 170 kg (other items) = 1920 kg.

Each truck can carry 160 kg at a time.
To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we'll divide the total weight by the weight each truck can carry:
1920 kg / 160 kg = 12 trips.

Since the farmer has three trucks, he can make 3 trips at a time.
So, the total number of trips is 12 / 3 = 4 trips.

Later, Uma saw another 10-foot shark with 6 remoras, each 8 inches long, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?",45.0,"To find the percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras and divide it by the length of the shark, then multiply by 100.

Let's start with the first shark:

1. Convert the length of the shark from feet to inches: 40 feet x 12 inches/foot = 480 inches
2. Calculate the total length of the remoras: 18 remoras x 16 inches/remora = 288 inches
3. Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras: (288 inches / 480 inches) x 100 = 60%

However, 1/6 of the remoras swam away, so we need to subtract 1/6 of the total length of the remoras:

4. Calculate 1/6 of the total length of the remoras: 288 inches / 6 = 48 inches
5. Subtract 1/6 of the total length of the remoras from the total length: 288 inches - 48 inches = 240 inches
6. Calculate the new percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras: (240 inches / 480 inches) x 100 = 50%

Now, let's move on to the second shark:

1. Convert the length of the shark from feet to inches: 10 feet x 12 inches/foot = 120 inches
2. Calculate the total length of the remoras: 6 remoras x 8 inches/remora = 48 inches
3. Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras: (48 inches / 120 inches) x 100 = 40%

To find the average percentage, we add the percentages for both sharks and divide by 2:

(50% + 40%) / 2 = 90% / 2 = 45%

So, on average, 45% of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras.",45.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the total length of the remoras attached to the first shark. 
There are 18 remoras, each 16 inches long.
So, the total length of the remoras is 18 * 16 = 288 inches.

Since 1/6 of the remoras swam away, we need to find 1/6 of 18.
1/6 of 18 is 3, so 3 remoras swam away.
Now, there are 18 - 3 = 15 remoras left.
The total length of the remoras left is 15 * 16 = 240 inches.

We need to convert the length of the shark from feet to inches. 
1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so 40 feet is equal to 40 * 12 = 480 inches.

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras.
The percentage is (240 / 480) * 100 = 50%.

Next, we need to find the total length of the remoras attached to the second shark. 
There are 6 remoras, each 8 inches long.
So, the total length of the remoras is 6 * 8 = 48 inches.

We need to convert the length of the shark from feet to inches. 
1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so 10 feet is equal to 10 * 12 = 120 inches.

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras.
The percentage is (48 / 120) * 100 = 40%.

Finally, we can find the average percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras.
The average percentage is (50 + 40) / 2 = 45%.

How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?",14.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total capacity of the tables and bowls**

Each bowl can hold 24 almonds, and each table can hold 3 times that, which is 3 x 24 = 72 almonds.

Carlos has 7 bowls, so the total capacity of the bowls is 7 x 24 = 168 almonds.

Initially, Carlos has 3 tables, so the total capacity of the tables is 3 x 72 = 216 almonds.

**Step 2: Calculate the total capacity after 2 tables break**

2 tables break, so the total capacity of the tables is now 1 x 72 = 72 almonds (since only 1 table remains).

The total capacity of the bowls and tables is now 168 (bowls) + 72 (tables) = 240 almonds.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of almonds after Carlos eats one-fifth**

Carlos has 720 almonds initially and eats one-fifth of them, which is 720 x 1/5 = 144 almonds.

So, the number of almonds remaining is 720 - 144 = 576 almonds.

**Step 4: Calculate the number of bowls needed to hold the remaining almonds**

The total capacity of the bowls and tables is 240 almonds, but there are 576 almonds remaining. To find out how many more bowls are needed, we subtract the total capacity from the number of almonds remaining:

576 (almonds remaining) - 240 (total capacity) = 336 almonds

Since each bowl can hold 24 almonds, we divide the number of almonds that need to be placed by the capacity of each bowl:

336 almonds / 24 almonds per bowl = 14 bowls

However, Carlos already has 7 bowls, so we subtract the number of bowls he already has from the total number of bowls needed:

14 bowls - 7 bowls = 7 bowls

Therefore, Carlos needs 7 more bowls to place all the remaining almonds.",7.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Each bowl can hold 24 almonds.
Each table can hold 3 times that, so each table can hold 3 * 24 = 72 almonds.
Carlos has 7 bowls, so the bowls can hold 7 * 24 = 168 almonds.
He has 3 tables, but 2 tables break, so he has 3 - 2 = 1 table left.
The 1 table can hold 72 almonds.
So, the total number of almonds that can be placed is 168 + 72 = 240 almonds.
Carlos has 720 almonds.
He eats one-fifth of all the almonds, which is 720 / 5 = 144 almonds.
So, the number of almonds left is 720 - 144 = 576 almonds.
Since Carlos can only place 240 almonds, he needs to place 576 - 240 = 336 more almonds.

A: Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many almonds are left after Carlos eats one-fifth of them.
Carlos starts with 720 almonds.
He eats one-fifth of the almonds, which is 720 / 5 = 144 almonds.
So, the number of almonds left is 720 - 144 = 576 almonds.

Next, we need to find out how many almonds the remaining tables and bowls can hold.
Each table can hold three times the number of almonds a bowl can hold, which is 3 * 24 = 72 almonds.
There are 3 tables initially, but 2 tables break, so only 1 table remains.
The remaining table can hold 72 almonds.
There are 7 bowls, each holding 24 almonds.
So, the total number of almonds the 7 bowls can hold is 7 * 24 = 168 almonds.
The total number of almonds the remaining table and bowls can hold is 72 + 168 = 240 almonds.

Since the remaining table and bowls can only hold 240 almonds, but there are 576 almonds left, Carlos needs more bowls to hold the remaining almonds.
The number of almonds left to be placed is 576 - 240 = 336 almonds.
Each bowl can hold 24 almonds, so the number of bowls needed is 336 / 24 = 14.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of skeins needed for the grandchildren's winter wear**

* Shawl: 4 grandchildren x 5 skeins/shawl = 20 skeins
* Sweater: 4 grandchildren x 6 skeins/sweater = 24 skeins
* Poncho: 4 grandchildren x 8 skeins/poncho = 32 skeins
* Gloves: 4 grandchildren x 8 skeins/pair = 32 skeins
* Mittens: 4 grandchildren x 14 skeins/pair = 56 skeins

Total skeins for grandchildren: 20 + 24 + 32 + 32 + 56 = 164 skeins

How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mohammed needs to buy a week's worth of rice (7 days). He uses 3 kgs of rice per day, so he needs 7 x 3 = 21 kgs of rice.

2. The normal brand of rice costs ¥15 per kg, but Mohammed has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more. So, the cost of the expensive brand is ¥15 + 20% of ¥15 = ¥15 + ¥3 = ¥18 per kg.

3. The store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs. So, for the first 10 kgs, Mohammed will pay ¥18 - 40% of ¥18 = ¥18 - ¥7.2 = ¥10.8 per kg. For the remaining 11 kgs (21 - 10 = 11), he will pay the regular price of ¥18 per kg.

Mohammed needs to buy a week's worth of rice, which is 7 days.

The normal brand of rice costs ¥15 per kg, but he has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more.
To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate 20% of ¥15.
20% of ¥15 is 0.20 * ¥15 = ¥3.
So, the more expensive brand costs ¥15 + ¥3 = ¥18 per kg.

However, the store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs.
Mohammed needs to buy 21 kgs of rice, but the discount only applies to the first 10 kgs.
So, the cost of the first 10 kgs is ¥18 * 10 = ¥180.
With the 40% discount, the cost of the first 10 kgs is ¥180 - (0.40 * ¥180) = ¥180 - ¥72 = ¥108.

The remaining 11 kgs (21 - 10 = 11) will be sold at the regular price of ¥18 per kg.

Then, her reduced weekly collection is x - 5.
Since she has 2 weeks left, she will collect 2(x - 5) signatures.

Mia wants to increase her weekly collection.
Let's assume she will collect y signatures per week.
Since she has 2 weeks left, she will collect 2y signatures.

The total number of signatures they will collect in the remaining 2 weeks is 2(x - 5) + 2y.
We know that this total should be equal to 78.
So, we can set up the equation: 2(x - 5) + 2y = 78.

However, we don't know the value of x, which is Jasmine's original weekly collection.
But we can use the information that Jasmine has 36 signatures so far, and she has been collecting signatures for 6 weeks.

Let's assume her original weekly collection is 6.
Then, her reduced weekly collection is 6 - 5 = 1.
In 2 weeks, she will collect 2(1) = 2 signatures.

Now, we can rewrite the equation: 2 + 2y = 78.
Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: 2y = 76.

So, her average weekly collection is 36 / 6 = 6.
In the remaining 2 weeks, she will collect signatures on weekends only, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week.
So, her reduced weekly collection is 6 - 5 = 1.
In 2 weeks, she will collect 2(1) = 2 signatures.

Mia wants to increase her weekly collection.
Let's assume she will collect y signatures per week.
Since she has 2 weeks left, she will collect 2y signatures.

The total number of signatures they will collect in the remaining 2 weeks is 2 + 2y.
We know that this total should be equal to 78.
So, we can set up the equation: 2 + 2y = 78.
Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: 2y = 76.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get: y = 38.

However, this is still not the correct answer. We need to re-examine the problem again.

Sofia and Benjamin start with 246 minutes to walk to the mall.
It takes them 16 minutes to get to the corner where the cinema is.
So, the time left is 246 - 16 = 230 minutes.
Then, it takes them another 52 minutes to get to the gym.
So, the time left is 230 - 52 = 178 minutes.
However, they have to return to pick up their wallets and then walk all the way back to the gym again.
The time it takes to get to the gym is 16 + 52 = 68 minutes.
Since they have to return home and then come back to the gym, they will spend 2 * 68 = 136 minutes.
So, the total time spent so far is 16 + 52 + 136 = 204 minutes.

He can make giant cubes that use 12 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 5 ounces, small cubes that use 1/2 of a ounce, and tiny cubes that are half the size of small cubes. He makes 48 total ice cubes, including 10 giant cubes, 14 small cubes, 12 medium cubes, and some tiny cubes. How many ounces of water does Leon have left?",122.0,"To find out how many ounces of water Leon has left, we need to first calculate the total amount of water he used. 

1. He made 10 giant cubes that use 12 ounces per cube:
   10 * 12 = 120 ounces

2. He made 12 medium cubes that use 5 ounces per cube:
   12 * 5 = 60 ounces

3. He made 14 small cubes that use 1/2 ounce (or 0.5 ounces) per cube:
   14 * 0.5 = 7 ounces

Now, we know he made a total of 48 ice cubes, including 10 giant, 14 small, and 12 medium cubes. We need to find out how many tiny cubes he made:
   Total ice cubes = 48
   Ice cubes (giant + medium + small) = 10 + 12 + 14 = 36
   So, the number of tiny cubes = Total ice cubes - Ice cubes (giant + medium + small)
   = 48 - 36
   = 12

Since tiny cubes are half the size of small cubes, they use 0.25 ounces per cube (half of 0.5 ounces). 
   Water used for tiny cubes = 12 * 0.25 = 3 ounces

Now, we can calculate the total amount of water used:
   Total water used = Water used for giant cubes + Water used for medium cubes + Water used for small cubes + Water used for tiny cubes
   = 120 + 60 + 7 + 3
   = 190 ounces

Leon started with 312 ounces of water. To find the amount of water he has left:
   Water left = Total water - Total water used
   = 312 - 190
   = 122 ounces

So, Leon has 122 ounces of water left.",122.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Leon starts with 312 ounces of water.

He makes 10 giant cubes, each using 12 ounces of water.
So, the total water used for giant cubes is 10 * 12 = 120 ounces.

He makes 14 small cubes, each using 1/2 ounce of water.
So, the total water used for small cubes is 14 * 0.5 = 7 ounces.

He makes 12 medium cubes, each using 5 ounces of water.
So, the total water used for medium cubes is 12 * 5 = 60 ounces.

Let's calculate the total water used so far:
120 (giant) + 7 (small) + 60 (medium) = 187 ounces.

Since Leon makes 48 total ice cubes, and we know the number of giant, small, and medium cubes, we can find the number of tiny cubes:
48 (total) - 10 (giant) - 14 (small) - 12 (medium) = 12 tiny cubes.

Each tiny cube is half the size of a small cube, which is 1/2 ounce. So, each tiny cube uses 1/4 ounce of water.
The total water used for tiny cubes is 12 * 0.25 = 3 ounces.

Now, let's calculate the total water used:
187 (giant, small, medium) + 3 (tiny) = 190 ounces.

Finally, let's find out how many ounces of water Leon has left:
312 (initial) - 190 (used) = 122 ounces.

What percentage of the students like to play video games if the number of the students that like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football?",5.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Find the total number of students who like to hike, play chess, swim, and play football.**

69 (hike) + 8 (chess) + 13 (swim) + 13 (football) = 103

**Step 2: Find the number of students who like to bake.**

Let's say the number of students who like to play football is x. Then, the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times x, which is 4x - 3.

We know that x = 13 (from the problem statement). So, the number of students who like to bake is:

4(13) - 3 = 52 - 3 = 49

**Step 3: Find the number of students who like to play video games.**

We know that the total number of students is 160, and we've already accounted for 103 students who like to hike, play chess, swim, and play football. We also know that 49 students like to bake.

So, the number of students who like to play video games is:

160 (total) - 103 (other hobbies) - 49 (bake) = 8

**Step 4: Find the percentage of students who like to play video games.**

To find the percentage, divide the number of students who like to play video games by the total number of students, and multiply by 100:

(8 / 160) × 100 = 5%

Therefore, 5% of the students like to play video games.",5.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of students who like to hike, play chess, swim, and play football.
Number of students who like to hike = 69
Number of students who like to play chess = 8
Number of students who like to swim = 13
Number of students who like to play football = 13
Total number of students who like these activities = 69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103

Now, we know that the rest of the students like to either play video games or bake. So, the total number of students who like to play video games or bake is:
160 (total students) - 103 (students who like other activities) = 57

We are also given that the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football. Let's use this information to find the number of students who like to bake.
Number of students who like to play football = 13
Four times this number = 4 * 13 = 52
Three less than this number = 52 - 3 = 49

So, the number of students who like to bake is 49.

Now, we can find the number of students who like to play video games:
Total number of students who like to play video games or bake = 57
Number of students who like to bake = 49
Number of students who like to play video games = 57 - 49 = 8

Finally, we can find the percentage of students who like to play video games:
Number of students who like to play video games = 8

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the workshop**

The cost of the workshop for 2 days is:

* Hotel: 2 x ₣100 = ₣200
* Food: 2 x ₣20 = ₣40
* Transportation: 2 x ₣10 = ₣20

The local charity is covering 1/10 of the remaining cost:

1/10 x ₣220 = ₣22

**Step 4: Calculate the amount Oliver still needs to cover**

Oliver has ₣85, and the charity is covering ₣22, so we subtract these amounts from the remaining cost:

**Step 1: Find the cost of a bagel**

The cost of a bagel is one-fourth of a loaf of bread, which costs €5. So, the cost of a bagel is:

€5 ÷ 4 = €1.25 per bagel

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of 8 bagels with a 20% discount**

Since the bakery has a promotion that offers a 20% discount on 7 or more bagels, we'll apply the discount to the cost of 8 bagels.

First, calculate the total cost of 8 bagels without the discount:

8 bagels × €1.25 per bagel = €10

Then, apply the 20% discount:

€10 × 0.20 = €2 (discount amount)
€10 - €2 = €8 (cost of 8 bagels with discount)

Next, we need to find the cost of 8 bagels. Since the bakery has a promotion that gives a 20% discount on 7 or more bagels, we need to calculate the discount first. The total cost of 8 bagels without discount is:

Jamal starts with $80 and wants 10 gallons of paint, each priced at $7.0, and 3 carpenter pencils, each costing $2. The store offers a 10% discount on paint for members. How much more money does Elena have left than Jamal after they leave the store?",8.0,"To find out how much money Elena and Jamal have left, we need to calculate the total cost of their purchases and subtract that from the amount of money they started with.

**Elena's purchases:**

* 15 anchors at $0.26 each = 15 x $0.26 = $3.90
* 9 nails at $0.61 each = 9 x $0.61 = $5.49
* 10 gallons of paint at $7.00 each = 10 x $7.00 = $70.00

Total cost for Elena = $3.90 + $5.49 + $70.00 = $79.39

Elena started with $98.39, so she has:
$98.39 - $79.39 = $19.00 left

**Jamal's purchases:**

* 10 gallons of paint at $7.00 each, with a 10% discount = 10 x $7.00 x 0.9 = $63.00 (since he gets a 10% discount as a member)
* 3 carpenter pencils at $2.00 each = 3 x $2.00 = $6.00

Total cost for Jamal = $63.00 + $6.00 = $69.00

Now, let's compare how much money Elena and Jamal have left:
Elena has $19.00 left, and Jamal has $11.00 left.

To find out how much more money Elena has left than Jamal, we subtract Jamal's amount from Elena's amount:

Elena has $8.00 more than Jamal after they leave the store.",8.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Elena wants to buy.
Elena buys 15 anchors at $0.26 each.
So, the total cost of anchors is 15 * $0.26 = $3.90.

She also buys 9 nails at $0.61 each.
So, the total cost of nails is 9 * $0.61 = $5.49.

Additionally, she buys 10 gallons of paint at a price that will be calculated later, as we need to calculate Jamal's paint cost first.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamal wants to buy.
Jamal buys 10 gallons of paint at $7.00 each, but he gets a 10% discount.
So, the discount on paint is 10% of $7.00 * 10 = 0.10 * $70 = $7.00.
The total cost of paint is $70.00 - $7.00 = $63.00.

He also buys 3 carpenter pencils at $2.00 each.
So, the total cost of pencils is 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

Now, let's go back to Elena's paint cost. Since Elena is not a member, she does not get any discount on paint. 
So, the total cost of paint for Elena is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00.

Now we can calculate the total amount Elena spent:
Elena's total cost is $3.90 (anchors) + $5.49 (nails) + $70.00 (paint).
So, Elena's total cost is $3.90 + $5.49 + $70.00 = $79.39.

Now we can calculate the total amount Jamal spent:
Jamal's total cost is $63.00 (paint) + $6.00 (pencils).
So, Jamal's total cost is $63.00 + $6.00 = $69.00.

Elena had $98.39 and spent $79.39.
So, Elena has $98.39 - $79.39 = $19.00 left.

Jamal had $80.00 and spent $69.00.
So, Jamal has $80.00 - $69.00 = $11.00 left.

**Step 1: Determine the daily consumption of each person**

* Arash can eat 5 pieces a day.
* Ava can eat twice as much as Arash, so Ava can eat 2 x 5 = 10 pieces a day.
* DeShawn can eat twice as much as Ava, so DeShawn can eat 2 x 10 = 20 pieces a day.

**Step 2: Calculate the total daily consumption before DeShawn goes on a diet**

* Total daily consumption = Arash + Ava + DeShawn = 5 + 10 + 20 = 35 pieces a day.

**Step 3: Calculate the total consumption for the first 2 days**

* Total consumption in 2 days = 35 pieces/day x 2 days = 70 pieces.

**Step 4: Determine DeShawn's new daily consumption after going on a diet**

* DeShawn cuts his consumption by half, so his new daily consumption is 20/2 = 10 pieces a day.

**Step 5: Calculate the new total daily consumption after DeShawn goes on a diet**

* Remaining pieces = Total pieces - Total consumption in 2 days = 120 - 70 = 50 pieces.

**Step 7: Calculate the number of days it will take to finish the remaining cake**

* Number of days = Remaining pieces / New total daily consumption = 50 / 25 = 2 days.

**Step 8: Add the initial 2 days to the number of days it will take to finish the remaining cake**

Initially, the total number of pieces eaten per day is 5 + 10 + 20 = 35 pieces.

After 2 days, the total number of pieces eaten is 35 * 2 = 70 pieces.

The remaining number of pieces is 120 - 70 = 50 pieces.

DeShawn decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half, so DeShawn can eat 20 / 2 = 10 pieces a day.

The new total number of pieces eaten per day is 5 + 10 + 10 = 25 pieces.

To find the number of days it will take to eat the remaining 50 pieces, we divide 50 by 25.

Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks.",530.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of occupied rooms**

The care facility has a capacity of 1900 rooms, and 1/4 of them are occupied. To find the number of occupied rooms, we'll multiply the total capacity by 1/4:

 Occupied rooms = 1900 x 1/4
= 1900 x 0.25
= 475 rooms

**Step 2: Calculate the number of rooms out of service**

One-fourth of all the rooms are out of service. To find the number of rooms out of service, we'll multiply the total capacity by 1/4:

 Rooms out of service = 1900 x 1/4
= 1900 x 0.25
= 475 rooms

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of unavailable rooms**

The total number of unavailable rooms is the sum of occupied rooms and rooms out of service:

 Total unavailable rooms = Occupied rooms + Rooms out of service
= 475 + 475
= 950 rooms

**Step 4: Calculate the initial number of unoccupied rooms**

The initial number of unoccupied rooms is the difference between the total capacity and the total number of unavailable rooms:

 Initial unoccupied rooms = Total capacity - Total unavailable rooms

= 950 rooms

**Step 5: Calculate the number of patients admitted in 3 weeks**

The care facility admits 20 patients per day. To find the total number of patients admitted in 3 weeks, we'll multiply the daily admission rate by the number of days in 3 weeks (21 days):

 Patients admitted in 3 weeks = 20 patients/day x 21 days
= 420 patients

**Step 6: Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks**

The total number of unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks is the initial number of unoccupied rooms minus the number of patients admitted in 3 weeks:

 Total unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks = Initial unoccupied rooms - Patients admitted in 3 weeks

Total earnings on Wednesday = ₺243 + ₺168 = ₺411

**Thursday:**
Muffins: 38 boxes × ₺9 = ₺342
Apricot pies: 21 boxes × ₺21 = ₺441

So, Faisal's average daily earning is ₺796.",796.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

On Thursday, Faisal sold 21 boxes of apricot pie.
On Wednesday, he sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie than on Thursday.
So, the number of boxes of apricot pie sold on Wednesday is 21 - 13 = 8.

On Wednesday, Faisal sold 27 boxes of muffin.
On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffin than on Wednesday.
So, the number of boxes of muffin sold on Thursday is 27 + 11 = 38.

On Friday, Faisal sold as much as he did in the past two days combined.
So, the number of boxes of muffin sold on Friday is 27 + 38 = 65.
And the number of boxes of apricot pie sold on Friday is 8 + 21 = 29.

Now, let's calculate Faisal's total earnings for each day:
Wednesday: 27 muffins * ₺9/muffin = ₺243, 8 apricot pies * ₺21/apricot pie = ₺168, Total: ₺243 + ₺168 = ₺411.
Thursday: 38 muffins * ₺9/muffin = ₺342, 21 apricot pies * ₺21/apricot pie = ₺441, Total: ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783.
Friday: 65 muffins * ₺9/muffin = ₺585, 29 apricot pies * ₺21/apricot pie = ₺609, Total: ₺585 + ₺609 = ₺1194.

Faisal's total earnings for the three days is ₺411 + ₺783 + ₺1194 = ₺2388.

Olga's flowers grow 3meters wide so she needs to leave 12 meters between every plant (including the plants width). Olga already owns 7 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ₣9 at the store. However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",31.0,"To find out how much money Olga will spend, we need to calculate the total number of plants she needs and then calculate the cost.

Step 1: Calculate the total space taken by each plant.
Each plant is 3 meters wide and needs 12 meters of space between plants, including the plant's width. So, the total space taken by each plant is 3 + 12 = 15 meters.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of plants Olga needs.
The flower bed is 132 meters long. To find the total number of plants, we divide the length of the flower bed by the space taken by each plant.
132 / 15 = 8.8

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 8 plants (because we can't fit another plant in the remaining space).

Step 3: Calculate the number of plants Olga needs to buy.
Olga already owns 7 flowers, so she needs to buy:
8 (total plants needed) - 7 (plants already owned) = 1 plant

However, since she needs to leave space for the last plant, we should round up to the nearest whole number of plants that can fit in the flower bed. In this case, we round up to 8 plants, but she already has 7, so she needs 1 more plant but actually needs to buy 2 plants to fill the bed (one for the end and one to fill the space). 

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the plants.
Each plant costs ₣9. Since Olga needs to buy 2 plants (to fill the bed and have one at the end), the total cost is:
2 * ₣9 = ₣18

However, since she's buying more than 2 plants isn't true in this case, she is buying 2 plants so she will get a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase.
₣18 - ₣5 = ₣13

To determine how much money Olga will spend, we first need to find out how many flowers she needs to fill her flower bed.
Each flower, including the 12-meter space between them, takes up 15 meters (12 meters of space + 3 meters of flower width).
The flower bed is 132 meters long.
So, the number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed is 132 / 15 = 8.8.
Since we can't have a fraction of a flower, we can fit 8 flowers in the flower bed, considering the space required.

However, Olga already owns 7 flowers. Therefore, she only needs 8 - 7 = 1 more flower to fill the flower bed.

Since Olga needs to buy only 1 flower, she will not receive the discount.
So, the cost of buying 1 flower is 1 * ₣9 = ₣9.

How many minutes will it take her to peel and saute 150 clams if it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam before peeling it? Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.,163.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to wash the clams**

Olga needs to wash 150 clams, and it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam. To find the total time, we'll multiply the number of clams by the time it takes to wash each clam:

150 clams × 12 seconds/clam = 1800 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we'll convert the time to minutes:

1800 seconds ÷ 60 = 30 minutes

**Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to peel the clams**

Olga can peel 6 clams per minute. To find the time it takes to peel 150 clams, we'll divide the number of clams by the rate at which she peels them:

150 clams ÷ 6 clams/minute = 25 minutes

**Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to sauté the clams**

Olga can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes. To find the time it takes to sauté 150 clams, we'll multiply the time it takes to sauté 30 clams by the number of batches:

150 clams ÷ 30 clams/batch = 5 batches

Since it takes 19 minutes to sauté each batch, we'll multiply the number of batches by the time per batch:

5 batches × 19 minutes/batch = 95 minutes

**Step 4: Add the break time and calculate the total time**

Olga needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams. We'll add this break time to the total time:

Time to wash clams: 30 minutes
Time to peel clams: 25 minutes
Break time: 13 minutes
Time to sauté clams: 95 minutes

Total time = 30 + 25 + 13 + 95 = 163 minutes

Therefore, it will take Olga 163 minutes to peel and sauté 150 clams.",150.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
Olga needs to peel 150 clams, and it takes her 6 clams per minute to peel.
So, the time to peel all 150 clams is 150 / 6 = 25 minutes.
However, before peeling each clam, Olga needs to wash it, which takes 12 seconds per clam.
The total time to wash all 150 clams is 150 * 12 seconds = 1800 seconds.
We need to convert this to minutes, so 1800 seconds / 60 = 30 minutes.
So, the total time to wash and peel the clams is 30 minutes + 25 minutes = 55 minutes.
After peeling, Olga needs to take a 13-minute break.
So, the total time before sautéing is 55 minutes + 13 minutes = 68 minutes.
Olga can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes.
So, the time to sauté 150 clams is (150 / 30) * 19 = 95 minutes.

How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?",1755.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten per day by the uncle and spouse**

Uncle eats 10 pizzas per day
Spouse eats 20 pizzas per day
Total pizzas eaten per day by uncle and spouse = 10 + 20 = 30 pizzas per day

**Step 2: Calculate the number of pizzas eaten per day by the grandchild**

Grandchild eats 2/4 of the combined number of pizzas eaten by uncle and spouse
2/4 = 1/2
Grandchild eats 1/2 of 30 pizzas per day = 30 x 1/2 = 15 pizzas per day

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten per day by the family**

Total pizzas eaten per day by family = 30 (uncle and spouse) + 15 (grandchild) = 45 pizzas per day

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten in the first month**

There are 30 days in a month, so:
Total pizzas eaten in the first month = 45 pizzas per day x 30 days = 1350 pizzas

**Step 5: Calculate the number of pizzas eaten in the first half of the second month (with 60% reduction)**

Reduction in pizzas eaten = 60% of 45 pizzas per day = 0.6 x 45 = 27 pizzas per day
New pizzas eaten per day = 45 - 27 = 18 pizzas per day
There are 15 days in the first half of the month, so:
Total pizzas eaten in the first half of the second month = 18 pizzas per day x 15 days = 270 pizzas

**Step 6: Calculate the number of pizzas eaten in the second half of the second month (with an additional 50% reduction)**

Reduction in pizzas eaten = 50% of 18 pizzas per day = 0.5 x 18 = 9 pizzas per day

Their combined number of pizzas is 10 + 20 = 30 pizzas per day.
The grandchild eats 2/4 of the combined number of pizzas, which is (2/4) * 30 = 15 pizzas per day.
So, the total number of pizzas eaten per day is 10 + 20 + 15 = 45 pizzas.

In the first month, they eat 45 pizzas per day for 30 days.
So, the total number of pizzas eaten in the first month is 45 * 30 = 1350 pizzas.

In the second month, they reduce their consumption by 60% for the first 15 days.
60% of 45 pizzas is (60/100) * 45 = 27 pizzas.
So, their new daily consumption for the first 15 days is 45 - 27 = 18 pizzas per day.
They eat 18 pizzas per day for 15 days, which is 18 * 15 = 270 pizzas.

Step 1: Find out how many emails Mohammed receives in a 6-day work week.
Mohammed receives 30 emails a day. 
In 6 days, he receives 30 * 6 = 180 emails.

Step 2: Find out how many emails Mohammed doesn't need to respond to.
20% of 180 emails don't require any response.
20% of 180 = 0.20 * 180 = 36 emails.

Step 3: Find out how many emails are left to respond to.
180 - 36 = 144 emails.

Step 4: Find out how many emails Mohammed can respond to in a normal day.
He can respond to 2 less than 1/2 of the emails.
1/2 of 144 is 144 / 2 = 72.
2 less than 72 is 72 - 2 = 70 emails per day (for 5 days).

Step 5: Find out how many emails Mohammed responds to in 5 days.
He responds to 70 emails per day.
In 5 days, he responds to 70 * 5 = 350 emails.

However, he only responds to 70 emails in 5 normal days, but we are calculating for 5 normal days and 1 overtime day where he responds to more emails.
He responds to 70 emails in a normal day. We need to remove this from the total emails he has left to respond to in the week. We had 144 emails left to respond to in the week, so 144 - 70 = 74 emails left.

Step 6: Find out how many emails Mohammed responds to in 1 overtime day.
On the last day, he can respond to 10% more emails than usual.
10% of 70 is 0.10 * 70 = 7.
So, he can respond to 70 + 7 = 77 emails on the last day.

In 5 normal days, he responds to 70 * 5 = 350 emails (Total emails he would respond to in 5 normal days).
However we have already removed 70 emails per day for 5 days, so now we need to calculate 70 * 5 is 350, which is wrong since we are actually doing 70 emails a day for 5 days and 74 emails for the 6th day, so we just do 70 * 5 = 350 and add 74.

The number of emails that require a response is 30 - 6 = 24.

From the rest, Mohammed can only respond to 2 less than the 1/2 of them.
So, the number of emails he can respond to is 1/2 * 24 = 12.
Since he can respond to 2 less than that, he can respond to 12 - 2 = 10 emails per day.

Since Mohammed works for 6 days, the total number of emails he responds to is 10 * 6 = 60.
However, on the last day, he works overtime and can respond to 10% more emails than usual.
So, on the last day, he can respond to 10 * 1.1 = 11 emails.

The total number of emails he responds to in a 6-day work week is 60 - 10 + 11 = 61.

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"Ananya walks 24 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 miles of walking on the beach and 14 miles of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?",85.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Find Ananya's original speed on the beach**

Let's call Ananya's original speed on the beach ""x"" miles per hour. Since she walks 10 miles on the beach, the time taken to walk on the beach is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 10 miles / x miles/hour

We know that Ananya spends 50 minutes on the beach, so we can convert this to hours:

50 minutes = 50/60 hours = 5/6 hours

Now, we can set up an equation:

5/6 hours = 10 miles / x miles/hour

**Step 2: Solve for x**

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

5/6 hours × x miles/hour = 10 miles

x = 10 miles × 6/5
x = 12 miles/hour

So, Ananya's original speed on the beach is 12 miles per hour.

**Step 3: Find Ananya's original speed on the sidewalk**

Since Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, her original speed on the sidewalk is:

Sidewalk speed = 2 × Beach speed
Sidewalk speed = 2 × 12 miles/hour
Sidewalk speed = 24 miles/hour

**Step 4: Find Ananya's new speed on the beach and sidewalk**

Due to her injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. So, her new speeds are:

New beach speed = 12 miles/hour / 2 = 6 miles/hour
New sidewalk speed = 24 miles/hour / 2 = 12 miles/hour

**Step 5: Find the time taken to walk on the sidewalk**

Ananya walks 14 miles on the sidewalk. The time taken to walk on the sidewalk is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 14 miles / 12 miles/hour
Time = 7/6 hours

Converting this to minutes:

7/6 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 70 minutes

**Step 6: Find the total time taken to complete the walk**

The total time taken to complete the walk is the sum of the time taken to walk on the beach and the time taken to walk on the sidewalk:

Total time = 50 minutes + 70 minutes
Total time = 120 minutes

Therefore, it takes Ananya 120 minutes to complete the entire 24-mile walk.",24.0,0,"Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find Ananya's original speed on the beach. We know she spends 50 minutes walking 10 miles on the beach.
So, her original speed on the beach is 10 miles / 50 minutes = 0.2 miles per minute.
Since her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach, her original speed on the sidewalk is 2 x 0.2 miles per minute = 0.4 miles per minute.
Due to her injury, her speed decreases by half on both the beach and the sidewalk.
So, her new speed on the beach is 0.2 miles per minute / 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.
And her new speed on the sidewalk is 0.4 miles per minute / 2 = 0.2 miles per minute.
Now, we can calculate the time it takes her to walk 14 miles on the sidewalk at the new speed.
Time on the sidewalk = 14 miles / 0.2 miles per minute = 70 minutes.
We already know she spends 50 minutes walking on the beach.
So, the total time it takes her to complete the entire 24-mile walk is 70 minutes + 50 minutes = 120 minutes.
The answer is 120.",120.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Ananya walks 10 miles on the beach and 14 miles on the sidewalk.
She walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.
However, her speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk.

Let's first find her original speed on the beach. We know she spends 50 minutes walking 10 miles on the beach, but her speed has decreased by half. So, her original speed on the beach is twice as fast as her current speed.

Since she walks 10 miles in 50 minutes at her decreased speed, she would walk 10 miles in 25 minutes at her original speed (50 / 2 = 25).

Now, let's find her original speed on the beach in miles per minute. Her original speed on the beach is 10 miles / 25 minutes = 0.4 miles per minute.

Since she walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, her original speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 miles per minute.

However, her speed has decreased by half on the sidewalk as well. So, her current speed on the sidewalk is 0.8 / 2 = 0.4 miles per minute.

Now, let's find the time it takes for her to walk 14 miles on the sidewalk at her current speed. Time = Distance / Speed = 14 miles / 0.4 miles per minute = 35 minutes.

We already know it takes her 50 minutes to walk 10 miles on the beach. So, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk is 50 minutes + 35 minutes = 85 minutes.

How many cookies are still hidden in the yard?",64.0,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Amelia initially had 11 dozen cookies. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 cookies, Amelia had 11 x 12 = 132 cookies.

2. Amelia ate 5 cookies for breakfast. So, she had 132 - 5 = 127 cookies left.

3. Elena finds 5 cookies. So, there are now 127 - 5 = 122 cookies left.

4. Mei finds twice as many as Elena. Since Elena found 5 cookies, Mei found 5 x 2 = 10 cookies. So, there are now 122 - 10 = 112 cookies left.

5. Xavier finds 2 less than Mei. Since Mei found 10 cookies, Xavier found 10 - 2 = 8 cookies. So, there are now 112 - 8 = 104 cookies left.

6. Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier. Since Xavier found 8 cookies, Mohammed found 8 / 8 = 1 cookie. So, there are now 104 - 1 = 103 cookies left.

7. Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined. Since Mei found 10 cookies and Elena found 5 cookies, they found a total of 10 + 5 = 15 cookies. Two dozen cookies is equal to 24 cookies. So, Umar found 15 + 24 = 39 cookies. However, we are only interested in how many cookies are left, not how many Umar found. Since Umar found cookies that were already hidden, this step does not change the number of cookies left.

Amelia initially had 11 dozen cookies. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 cookies, Amelia had 11 * 12 = 132 cookies.

Elena finds 5 cookies, so the number of cookies left is 127 - 5 = 122 cookies.

Mei finds twice as many as Elena, which is 2 * 5 = 10 cookies. So, the number of cookies left is 122 - 10 = 112 cookies.

Xavier finds 2 less than Mei, which is 10 - 2 = 8 cookies. So, the number of cookies left is 112 - 8 = 104 cookies.

Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier, which is 8 / 8 = 1 cookie. So, the number of cookies left is 104 - 1 = 103 cookies.

Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined. Mei and Elena found 10 + 5 = 15 cookies. Two dozen cookies is 2 * 12 = 24 cookies. So, Umar finds 24 + 15 = 39 cookies.

How much money does he make in a week?",1243.0,"To find out how much money Oscar makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from, the total number of collections he makes, and then multiply that by his pay per collection and add the tips.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes:
2 complexes x 100 apartments/complex = 200 apartments

Step 2: Calculate the number of apartments in the last complex:
The last complex is 35% bigger than the other 2 combined, so we need to find 35% of 200 apartments and add it to 200.
35% of 200 = 0.35 x 200 = 70
Total apartments in the last complex = 200 + 70 = 270 apartments

Step 3: Calculate the total number of apartments Oscar collects garbage from:
200 apartments (first 2 complexes) + 270 apartments (last complex) = 470 apartments

However, we need to subtract the vacant apartments from the first 2 complexes:
9 apartments/complex x 2 complexes = 18 apartments
Total apartments after subtracting vacant ones = 470 - 18 = 452 apartments

Step 4: Calculate the total number of collections Oscar makes in a week:
5 collections/week x 452 apartments = 2260 collections/week

Step 5: Calculate Oscar's pay per week:
Pay per collection = ₣0.5
Total pay per week = 2260 collections/week x ₣0.5/collection = ₣1130/week

Step 6: Calculate the tips Oscar earns:
Tips = 10% of total pay
Tips = 0.1 x ₣1130 = ₣113/week

Step 7: Calculate Oscar's total earnings per week:

Total earnings = ₣1130 + ₣113 = ₣1243/week

Therefore, Oscar makes ₣1243 in a week.",1243.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes.
Each complex has 100 apartments.
So, the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes is 2 * 100 = 200.

However, 9 apartments from each of the first 2 complexes were vacant.
So, the total number of vacant apartments is 2 * 9 = 18.
The total number of apartments that require collection service in the first 2 complexes is 200 - 18 = 182.

Now, let's find the number of apartments in the last complex.
The last complex is 35% bigger than the other 2 combined.
So, the number of apartments in the last complex is 200 + (35% of 200).
35% of 200 is 0.35 * 200 = 70.
So, the number of apartments in the last complex is 200 + 70 = 270.

Now, let's find the total number of apartments that require collection service.
The total number of apartments is 182 + 270 = 452.

Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each place.
So, the total number of collections per week is 452 * 5 = 2260.

Oscar gets paid ₣0.5 per collection for each apartment.
So, his total earnings per week is 2260 * ₣0.5 = ₣1130.

He also earns an additional 10% in tips.
10% of ₣1130 is 0.1 * ₣1130 = ₣113.
