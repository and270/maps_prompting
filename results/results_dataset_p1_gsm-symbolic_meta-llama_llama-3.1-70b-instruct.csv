She bought 6 dozen croissants which cost $19 per dozen, 4 dozen macarons which cost $77 per dozen, and 3 dozen brownies for $118 per dozen. How much was the total cost if she received 25% discount on all purchases?",582.0,"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them up. After that, we can apply the 25% discount.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of croissants**
6 dozen croissants x $19 per dozen = 6 x $19 = $114

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of macarons**
4 dozen macarons x $77 per dozen = 4 x $77 = $308

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of brownies**
3 dozen brownies x $118 per dozen = 3 x $118 = $354

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost**
Add up the cost of all items: $114 + $308 + $354 = $776

**Step 5: Apply the 25% discount**
To find the discount amount, multiply the total cost by 25% (or 0.25): $776 x 0.25 = $194
Subtract the discount amount from the total cost: $776 - $194 = $582

Therefore, the total cost after the 25% discount is $582.",582.0,1,"Beatriz starts with various purchases: 
She buys 6 dozen croissants.
6 dozen croissants cost 6 * 19 = 114 dollars.
She buys 4 dozen macarons.
4 dozen macarons cost 4 * 77 = 308 dollars.
She buys 3 dozen brownies.
3 dozen brownies cost 3 * 118 = 354 dollars.
So, the total cost before discount is 114 + 308 + 354 = 776 dollars.
To find the amount of the discount, multiply the total cost before discount by 25% or 0.25, 
which is 776 * 0.25 = 194 dollars.
Now, subtract the discount from the total cost before discount to find the total cost after the discount.

p1,gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"I have 16 liters of mango drink that is one-ninth water and I wish to add it to 14 liters of apple drink that is one-half water. But as I pour it, I spill 7 liters of the mango drink. To make up for that, I add 7 liters of water to the mix. What percentage of the final mix is water?",50.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the mango drink**

You have 16 liters of mango drink that is one-ninth water. To find the amount of water, multiply the total amount by the fraction:

16 liters x (1/9) = 16/9 liters = 1.78 liters (approximately)

So, the mango drink contains approximately 1.78 liters of water.

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the apple drink**

You have 14 liters of apple drink that is one-half water. To find the amount of water, multiply the total amount by the fraction:

14 liters x (1/2) = 14/2 liters = 7 liters

So, the apple drink contains 7 liters of water.

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water after spilling and adding water**

You spill 7 liters of the mango drink, which means you lose 7 liters of the drink, but not all of it is water. Since the mango drink is one-ninth water, the amount of water lost is:

7 liters x (1/9) = 7/9 liters = 0.78 liters (approximately)

You add 7 liters of water to make up for the spill.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water:

Water from mango drink: 1.78 liters - 0.78 liters = 1 liter
Water from apple drink: 7 liters
Water added: 7 liters

Total water: 1 liter + 7 liters + 7 liters = 15 liters

**Step 4: Calculate the total volume of the final mix**

You have 16 liters of mango drink, but you spill 7 liters, so you're left with:

16 liters - 7 liters = 9 liters

You add this to the 14 liters of apple drink:

9 liters + 14 liters = 23 liters

Then, you add 7 liters of water:

23 liters + 7 liters = 30 liters

So, the total volume of the final mix is 30 liters.

**Step 5: Calculate the percentage of water in the final mix**

To find the percentage of water, divide the total amount of water by the total volume of the final mix, and multiply by 100:

(15 liters / 30 liters) x 100 = 50%

Therefore, the final mix is 50% water.",50.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

I start with 16 liters of mango drink that is one-ninth water. 
To find out how much water is in the mango drink, I multiply 16 by 1/9 (since it is one-ninth water).
So, the amount of water in the mango drink is 16 * 1/9 = 16/9 liters.

Then I spill 7 liters of the mango drink. 
This means the remaining mango drink is 16 - 7 = 9 liters.
Since the water content is one-ninth of the drink, the amount of water left in the mango drink is 9 * 1/9 = 1 liter.

Now I mix the remaining mango drink with 14 liters of apple drink that is one-half water. 
The amount of water in the apple drink is 14 * 1/2 = 7 liters.

So the total amount of water in the mix so far is 1 + 7 = 8 liters.

Then I add 7 liters of water to the mix. 
Now the total amount of water is 8 + 7 = 15 liters.

To find the total volume of the mix, I add the remaining mango drink (9 liters), the apple drink (14 liters), and the water I added (7 liters).
The total volume is 9 + 14 + 7 = 30 liters.

To find the percentage of water in the final mix, I divide the amount of water by the total volume and multiply by 100.
The percentage of water is (15/30) * 100 = 50%.

If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 10 hours if she spends 2/5 of the time running, 1/2 of the time skipping, and the remaining of the time walking?",27.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Mei can skip at 2 miles per hour. Since she can skip at a rate of speed that is 1/2 as fast as she can run, we can set up an equation to find her running speed:

Running speed = 2 x Skipping speed
Running speed = 2 x 2
Running speed = 4 miles per hour

We also know that Mei can run four times faster than she can walk. So, we can set up an equation to find her walking speed:

Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 4 / 4
Walking speed = 1 mile per hour

Now, let's find out how much time Mei spends on each activity:

Total time = 10 hours
Time spent running = 2/5 x 10 = 4 hours
Time spent skipping = 1/2 x 10 = 5 hours
Time spent walking = 10 - 4 - 5 = 1 hour

Now, let's calculate the distance Mei travels on each activity:

Distance run = Running speed x Time spent running
Distance run = 4 x 4
Distance run = 16 miles

Distance skipped = Skipping speed x Time spent skipping
Distance skipped = 2 x 5
Distance skipped = 10 miles

Distance walked = Walking speed x Time spent walking
Distance walked = 1 x 1
Distance walked = 1 mile

Finally, let's add up the distances to find the total distance Mei travels:

Total distance = Distance run + Distance skipped + Distance walked
Total distance = 16 + 10 + 1
Total distance = 27 miles

Therefore, Mei can travel 27 miles in 10 hours.",10.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Mei can skip at 2 miles per hour.
Since she can skip at a rate that is 1/2 as fast as she can run, we can find her running speed by multiplying the skipping speed by 2.
So, her running speed is 2 * 2 = 4 miles per hour.

Since Mei can run four times faster than she can walk, we can find her walking speed by dividing the running speed by 4.
So, her walking speed is 4 / 4 = 1 mile per hour.

Mei travels for a total of 10 hours. She spends 2/5 of the time running, which is 2/5 * 10 = 4 hours.
She spends 1/2 of the time skipping, which is 1/2 * 10 = 5 hours.
The remaining time is spent walking, which is 10 - (4 + 5) = 1 hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance Mei travels in each mode:
 Distance run = running speed * time = 4 * 4 = 16 miles.
 Distance skipped = skipping speed * time = 2 * 5 = 10 miles.
 Distance walked = walking speed * time = 1 * 1 = 1 mile.

The total distance Mei travels is 16 + 10 + 1 = 27 miles.

1. First, we need to calculate the remaining calories you can consume for the day:

Daily calorie target = 2300 calories
Calories already consumed = 1200 calories
Calories burned through exercise = 100 calories

Net calories remaining = Daily calorie target - Calories already consumed + Calories burned through exercise
= 2300 - 1200 + 100
= 1200 calories

2. Next, we need to find out how many calories are in the bag of cookies per ounce:

Calories per serving = 200 calories
Servings per bag = 5
Bag size = 150 oz

Calories per bag = Calories per serving * Servings per bag
= 200 calories * 5
= 1000 calories

Calories per oz = Calories per bag / Bag size
= 1000 calories / 150 oz
= 6.67 calories/oz (approximately)

3. Finally, we can calculate how many ounces you can eat:

Remaining calories = 1200 calories
Calories per oz = 6.67 calories/oz

Ounces you can eat = Remaining calories / Calories per oz
= 1200 calories / 6.67 calories/oz
= 180 oz (approximately)

Since the bag is 150 oz, and you can eat 180 oz, you can eat the entire bag (150 oz) and still have some calories left for the day.",150.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories are left in your daily target. 
You have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories, which means you have burned a total of 1200 + 100 = 1300 calories.
Your daily calorie target is 2300, so the number of calories left is 2300 - 1300 = 1000 calories.

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in the bag of cookies. 
The bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 200 calories, so the total number of calories in the bag is 5 * 200 = 1000 calories.

Since you have 1000 calories left in your daily target, and the bag of cookies has 1000 calories, you can eat the entire bag.

**Explanation**

I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the serving size and didn't account for the calories burned during exercise. I calculated that I could eat the entire 150 oz bag, but I didn't consider the fact that I had already consumed a significant portion of my daily calorie target.

**Error Keywords**

* Miscalculation of serving size
* Failure to subtract already consumed calories
* Ignoring exercise calories
* Poor division of ounces per serving

**Solution**

Here are the correct steps to solve the problem:

1. Calculate the total calories in the bag of cookies: 200 calories/serving x 5 servings = 1000 calories.
2. Determine the remaining daily calorie target by subtracting already consumed calories and adding exercise calories: 2300 - 1200 = 1100 + 100 = 1200 calories.
3. Calculate the number of servings that can be eaten within the remaining daily calorie target: 1200 calories / 200 calories/serving = 6 servings.
4. Since the bag has only 5 servings, determine the number of ounces that can be eaten: 150 oz / 5 servings = 30 oz/serving. Now calculate the total ounces for 5 servings out of 6 possible servings: 30 oz * (5/6) = 150 oz * (5/6) = 25 oz * 5 = 125 oz does not fit into this calculation. To eat the 6 servings required to meet the calorie goal calculate as 6 * (150 oz / 5) = 6 * 30 oz = 6 * 30 oz = 180 oz, then  180 - (30 oz * 1/6) =  180 oz -  5 oz =  175 oz  does not fit the bag constraint, due to the fact of the constraint 125 oz fits as a solution.


**Instructions**

1. Calculate the total calories in the bag of cookies.
2. Determine the remaining daily calorie target by subtracting already consumed calories and adding exercise calories.
3. Calculate the number of servings that can be eaten within the remaining daily calorie target.
4. Determine the number of ounces that can be eaten based on the serving size and the number of servings.

**Advice**

* Always calculate the serving size and total calories in the food item.
* Subtract already consumed calories and add exercise calories to determine the remaining daily calorie target.
* Double-check calculations to avoid errors.
* Consider the bag or packaging constraint when solving these types of problems, ensure that all calculations do not result in an uneaten portion, that would better suggest that a different less resource-intensive calculation took place at an earlier step.","Here is the adapted Self-Reflection prompt for the given question:

I incorrectly answered the question because I failed to account for the daily calorie target and already consumed calories. I also miscalculated the number of oz that can be eaten based on the remaining calories.

**Error Keywords**

* Miscalculation of servings
* Failure to account for daily calorie target
* Incorrect assumption about exercise calories
* Incorrect calculation of remaining calories

**Solution**

Let's solve the problem again:

1. Total calories in the bag = 200 calories/serving x 5 servings = 1000 calories.
2. Number of servings in the bag = 5.
3. Calories per serving = 200 calories.
4. Already consumed calories = 1200 calories.
5. Exercise calories = 100 calories.
6. Daily calorie target = 2300 calories.
7. Remaining calories = 2300 - 1200 + 100 = 1200 calories.
8. Since the bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 200 calories, we can calculate the number of oz per serving: 150 oz / 5 servings = 30 oz/serving.
9. Now, we can calculate the number of oz that can be eaten based on the remaining calories: 1200 calories / 200 calories/serving = 6 servings. Since each serving is 30 oz, we can eat 6 servings x 30 oz/serving = 180 oz. However, this is incorrect since we can't eat more than the total oz in the bag. We need to recalculate the number of oz that can be eaten based on the remaining calories and the total oz in the bag.
10. Let's recalculate: 1200 calories / 200 calories/serving = 6 servings. Since each serving is 30 oz, we can eat 6 servings x 30 oz/serving = 180 oz. However, the bag only has 150 oz. We need to find the fraction of the bag that we can eat: 1200 calories / 1000 calories (total calories in the bag) = 1.2. Multiply this fraction by the total oz in the bag: 1.2 x 150 oz = 180 oz. However, this is still incorrect since we can't eat more than the total oz in the bag. We need to find the correct fraction of the bag that we can eat.
11. Let's recalculate the fraction: 1200 calories / 1000 calories (total calories in the bag) = 1.2. However, we can't eat 1.2 times the bag. We need to find the correct fraction of the bag that we can eat. Since we can't eat more than the total oz in the bag, we can eat at most 150 oz. We need to find the fraction of the bag that corresponds to the remaining calories: 1200 calories / 200 calories/serving = 6 servings. Since each serving is 30 oz, we can eat 6 servings x 30 oz/serving = 180 oz. However, the bag only has 150 oz. We can eat at most 150 oz, which corresponds to 5 servings (150 oz / 30 oz/serving = 5 servings). We can eat 5 servings x 200 calories/serving = 1000 calories. We still have remaining calories: 1200 calories - 1000 calories = 200 calories. We can eat an additional 1 serving (200 calories / 200 calories/serving = 1 serving). We can eat an additional 30 oz (1 serving x 30 oz/serving = 30 oz). We can eat a total of 150 oz + 30 oz = 180 oz. However, this is still incorrect since we can't eat more than the total oz in the bag. We can eat at most 150 oz.
12. Let's recalculate the correct number of oz that can be eaten: We can eat 5 servings x 30 oz/serving = 150 oz. We still have remaining calories: 1200 calories - 1000 calories = 200 calories.

You are an expert in nutrition and calorie calculations.
You have incorrectly answered the following question.

Question: A protein bar has 250 calories per serving. If a 12 oz bar has 4 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 800 calories and exercised for 50 calories?

Wrong answer: I calculated that I could eat the entire 12 oz bar because I have already exercised and burned some calories.

Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information to help you answer the same question in the future.

First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific.
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.

Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.

For guidance, consider the following:

* Type of problem: This is a multi-step problem that involves calculating the number of servings, calories per serving, and daily calorie target.
* Common mistakes: Common mistakes include miscalculating the number of servings, forgetting to subtract already consumed calories, and not accounting for exercise calories.
* Complexity of the problem: This problem requires multiple calculations and considerations, making it moderately complex.

Example Output:

Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that exercising and burning calories meant I could eat the entire bar, without considering my daily calorie target and already consumed calories.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation of servings
- Failure to account for daily calorie target
- Incorrect assumption about exercise calories

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total calories in the bar.
2. Determine the number of servings in the bar.
3. Calculate the calories per serving.
4. Subtract already consumed calories from the daily calorie target.
5. Add exercise calories to the daily calorie target.
6. Calculate the number of oz that can be eaten based on the remaining calories.

Advice:
* Always calculate the total calories in a food item.
* Consider the number of servings and calories per serving.
* Account for already consumed calories and exercise calories when determining daily calorie intake.
* Double-check calculations to avoid errors.

Solution:
Let's solve the problem again:

1. Total calories in the bar = 250 calories/serving x 4 servings = 1000 calories.
2. Number of servings in the bar = 4.
3. Calories per serving = 250 calories.
4. Already consumed calories = 800 calories.
5. Exercise calories = 50 calories.
6. Daily calorie target = 2000 calories.
7. Remaining calories = 2000 - 800 + 50 = 1250 calories.
8. Number of oz that can be eaten = 1250 calories / 250 calories/serving = 5 oz.

Note: The correct answer is 5 oz, not the entire 12 oz bar.

Now, look at this question:
Question: According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has 200 calories per serving. If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?

Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.

For guidance, consider the following example:

[Example Input]
Question: A bag of chips has 150 calories per serving. If a 10 oz bag has 3 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2500 and you have already consumed 1000 calories and exercised for 200 calories?

Wrong answer: I forgot to subtract the calories already consumed and exercised from the daily calorie target.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I didn't account for the calories already consumed and exercised, which led to an incorrect calculation of the remaining calories available for consumption.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation of remaining calories
- Failure to consider calories already consumed and exercised
- Incorrect application of daily calorie target

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total calories already consumed and exercised.
2. Subtract the total calories already consumed and exercised from the daily calorie target.
3. Calculate the remaining calories available for consumption.
4. Determine the number of servings that can be consumed within the remaining calories.
5. Calculate the number of oz that can be eaten based on the number of servings.

Advice:
- Always consider the calories already consumed and exercised when calculating the remaining calories available for consumption.
- Make sure to apply the daily calorie target correctly.
- Double-check calculations to avoid miscalculations.

Solution:
Let's recalculate the correct answer:

1. Total calories already consumed and exercised = 1000 + 200 = 1200
2. Remaining calories available for consumption = 2500 - 1200 = 1300
3. Number of servings that can be consumed = 1300 / 150 = 8.67 (round down to 8 servings)
4. Number of oz that can be eaten = 8 servings \* (10 oz / 3 servings) = 26.67 oz

Now, apply this reflection to the original question:

Question: According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has 200 calories per serving. If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?

**Explanation:**
I answered the question incorrectly because I didn't properly calculate the remaining calories available for consumption and didn't consider the serving size of the cookies. I also didn't account for the fact that the 150 oz bag has 5 servings, which means the serving size is 30 oz per serving.

**Error Keywords:**

* Miscalculation of remaining calories
* Failure to consider serving size
* Incorrect application of daily calorie target
* Failure to account for total calories per serving

**Instructions:**

1. Calculate the total calories already consumed and exercised.
2. Subtract the total calories already consumed and exercised from the daily calorie target.
3. Calculate the remaining calories available for consumption.
4. Determine the number of servings that can be consumed within the remaining calories.
5. Calculate the number of oz that can be eaten based on the number of servings and serving size.

**Advice:**

* Always consider the calories already consumed and exercised when calculating the remaining calories available for consumption.
* Make sure to apply the daily calorie target correctly.
* Double-check calculations to avoid miscalculations.
* Pay attention to serving sizes and total calories per serving.

**Solution:**

1. Total calories already consumed and exercised = 1200 + 100 = 1300
2. Remaining calories available for consumption = 2300 - 1300 = 1000
3. Number of servings that can be consumed = 1000 / 200 = 5
4. Since the 150 oz bag has 5 servings, the serving size is 150 oz / 5 servings = 30 oz per serving.
5. Number of oz that can be eaten = 5 servings \* 30 oz per serving = 150 oz is incorrect, since we can only eat 5 servings, which is the entire bag, but we need to calculate how many oz we can eat based on the remaining calories. 
   Let's recalculate: 1000 / 200 = 5 servings, and since we can eat 5 servings, we can eat 5 * 30 oz = 150 oz, but this is the whole bag, so we need to calculate the oz per serving and then multiply by the number of servings we can eat based on our remaining calories.
   150 oz / 5 servings = 30 oz per serving

You are an expert in nutrition and calorie calculations.
You have incorrectly answered the following question.

Question: A protein bar has 250 calories per serving. If a 12 oz bar has 4 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 800 calories and exercised for 50 calories?

Wrong answer: I calculated that I could eat the entire 12 oz bar because I didn't take into account the calories already consumed and exercised.

Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information to help you answer the same question in the future.

First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific.
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.

Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.

For guidance, consider the following example:

[Example Input]
Question: A bag of chips has 150 calories per serving. If a 10 oz bag has 3 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2500 and you have already consumed 1000 calories and exercised for 200 calories?

Wrong answer: I forgot to subtract the calories already consumed and exercised from the daily calorie target.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I didn't account for the calories already consumed and exercised, which led to an incorrect calculation of the remaining calories available for consumption.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation of remaining calories
- Failure to consider calories already consumed and exercised
- Incorrect application of daily calorie target

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total calories already consumed and exercised.
2. Subtract the total calories already consumed and exercised from the daily calorie target.
3. Calculate the remaining calories available for consumption.
4. Determine the number of servings that can be consumed within the remaining calories.
5. Calculate the number of oz that can be eaten based on the number of servings.

Advice:
- Always consider the calories already consumed and exercised when calculating the remaining calories available for consumption.
- Make sure to apply the daily calorie target correctly.
- Double-check calculations to avoid miscalculations.

Solution:
Let's recalculate the correct answer:

1. Total calories already consumed and exercised = 1000 + 200 = 1200
2. Remaining calories available for consumption = 2500 - 1200 = 1300
3. Number of servings that can be consumed = 1300 / 150 = 8.67 (round down to 8 servings)
4. Number of oz that can be eaten = 8 servings \* (10 oz / 3 servings) = 26.67 oz

Now, apply this reflection to the original question:

Question: According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has 200 calories per serving. If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?

Please provide your reflection, including the explanation, error keywords, instructions, advice, and solution.

Now, look at this question:
Question: According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has 200 calories per serving. If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 150.0

Your previous reflection answers were:
Reflection 1: 125.0

Pavel usually sells tulips for ₺3.24 per basket, lilies for ₺3.57 per basket and orchids for ₺5.16 per basket. Pavel has no change today, so Pavel has decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. Pavel sells 19 baskets of tulips, 17 baskets of lilies and 35 baskets of orchids. How much will Pavel make, after receiving a 10% tip on every purchase?",330.0,"To find out how much Pavel will make, we need to calculate the total amount of money he will receive from selling the flowers, and then add the 10% tip.

First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar:

* Tulips: ₺3.24 → ₺3
* Lilies: ₺3.57 → ₺4
* Orchids: ₺5.16 → ₺5

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Pavel will receive from selling each type of flower:

* Tulips: 19 baskets × ₺3/basket = ₺57
* Lilies: 17 baskets × ₺4/basket = ₺68
* Orchids: 35 baskets × ₺5/basket = ₺175

The total amount of money Pavel will receive is:
₺57 + ₺68 + ₺175 = ₺300

Now, let's calculate the 10% tip:
10% of ₺300 = 0.10 × ₺300 = ₺30

So, the total amount of money Pavel will make, including the tip, is:
₺300 + ₺30 = ₺330

Therefore, Pavel will make a total of ₺330.",330.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Pavel sells tulips for ₺3.24 per basket, but he rounds the price to the nearest dollar, which is ₺3.
He sells lilies for ₺3.57 per basket, but he rounds the price to the nearest dollar, which is ₺4.
He sells orchids for ₺5.16 per basket, but he rounds the price to the nearest dollar, which is ₺5.

Pavel sells 19 baskets of tulips at ₺3 per basket, so he makes 19 * ₺3 = ₺57 from tulips.
He sells 17 baskets of lilies at ₺4 per basket, so he makes 17 * ₺4 = ₺68 from lilies.
He sells 35 baskets of orchids at ₺5 per basket, so he makes 35 * ₺5 = ₺175 from orchids.

The total amount Pavel makes from selling flowers is ₺57 + ₺68 + ₺175 = ₺300.

Pavel receives a 10% tip on every purchase, so he receives a tip of 10% of ₺300, which is 0.1 * ₺300 = ₺30.

Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 4 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Kayla remain with?",703.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of potted plants Kayla already has**

She has 12 potted plants on each of the 65 window ledges, so:
12 plants/ledge × 65 ledges = 780 plants

**Step 2: Add the new potted plants she received last week**

She received 43 new potted plants, so:
780 plants + 43 plants = 823 plants

**Step 3: Calculate the number of new plants she purchased yesterday**

She purchased 140 new plants at a 50% discount, but the discount doesn't affect the number of plants, so:
140 new plants

**Step 4: Add the new plants she purchased yesterday to the total**

823 plants + 140 plants = 963 plants

**Step 5: Calculate the number of plants she will give away**

She will give away 4 potted plants from each of the 65 window ledges, so:
4 plants/ledge × 65 ledges = 260 plants

**Step 6: Subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total**

963 plants - 260 plants = 703 plants

Therefore, Kayla will remain with 703 potted plants.",703.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Kayla already has 12 potted plants on each of the 65 window ledges.
So, the total number of potted plants she already has is 12 * 65 = 780.

She received 43 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery.
So, the total number of potted plants now is 780 + 43 = 823.

She also purchased 140 new plants yesterday.
So, the total number of potted plants now is 823 + 140 = 963.

However, she will give 4 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow.
There are 65 window ledges, so she will give away 4 * 65 = 260 potted plants.

First, let's find out how many miles 1/3 of the city is. 

1/3 of 18 miles = 18 / 3 = 6 miles

Now, we know that it takes 41 minutes to cover 3 miles. To find out how many minutes it takes to cover 6 miles, we can multiply the time it takes to cover 3 miles by 2, since 6 miles is twice 3 miles.

41 minutes * 2 = 82 minutes

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 41 minutes.
We need to find out how long it takes to cover 1/3 of the city, which is 18 miles across.

If he watched 24 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?",5.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Noah watched a total of 24 hours of TV. We need to find out how many 15-minute episodes he watched on Monday.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours he watched on Saturday and Sunday:

4 hours/night x 2 nights = 8 hours

Next, let's calculate the total number of hours he watched on Tuesday:

3 hours + 45 minutes = 3.75 hours ( converted 45 minutes to hours)

Now, let's calculate the total number of hours he watched on Wednesday:

2 x 5 hours = 10 hours

On Thursday, he watched four episodes, each 15 minutes. Let's convert this to hours:

4 x 15 minutes = 60 minutes = 1 hour

Now, let's add up the total number of hours he watched on all days except Monday:

8 hours + 3.75 hours + 10 hours + 1 hour = 22.75 hours

Since he watched a total of 24 hours, the number of hours he watched on Monday is:

24 hours - 22.75 hours = 1.25 hours

Now, let's convert this to 15-minute episodes:

1.25 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Since each episode is 15 minutes, the number of episodes he watched on Monday is:

75 minutes / 15 minutes/episode = 5 episodes

Therefore, Noah watched 5 episodes of the 15-minute show on Monday.",15.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Noah watched TV for a total of 24 hours.

On Saturday and Sunday, he watched 4-hour episodes each night, so that is 2 * 4 = 8 hours.

On Tuesday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. 45 minutes is 0.75 hours, so that is 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched two 5-hour episodes, so that is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

So, the total hours watched on Saturday, Sunday Tuesday, and Wednesday is 8 + 3.75 + 10 = 21.75 hours.

Noah watched 24 hours of TV in total, so he must have watched 24 - 21.75 = 2.25 hours on Monday and Thursday combined.

On Thursday, he watched four 15-minute episodes, which equals 4 * 0.25 = 1 hour.

This leaves 2.25 - 1 = 1.25 hours for Monday.

Since each episode on Monday is 15 minutes (or 0.25 hours), Noah must have watched 1.25 / 0.25 = 5 episodes.

If she used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.",504.0,"Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let the number of teaspoons of sugar Fatima used be x, the number of cups of water be y, and the number of tablespoons of milk be z.

We know that the ratio of sugar to water is 63:14, so we can set up the proportion:

x : y = 63 : 14
x = (63/14)y
x = (9/2)y  ...eq(1)

We also know that Fatima uses 9 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water, so we can set up another proportion:

z : y = 9 : 7
z = (9/7)y  ...eq(2)

We are also given that the total amount of sugar, water, and milk used is 760 teaspoons.

Since the amounts of water and milk are in cups and tablespoons respectively, but the total is in teaspoons, we need to convert everything to teaspoons. There are 16 tablespoons in 1 cup, but we don't need this conversion for our solution.

Now, the total amount is the sum of the amount of sugar, water and milk.
x + y + z = 760  ...eq(3)

From (1), 
x = (9/2)y 

Now substituting (1) and (2) in (3)
(9/2)y + y + (9/7)y = 760

Multiply both sides by 14,
63y + 14y + 18y = 760 * 14
95y = 10640
y = 10640/95 * (7/7)
y = 112 * (7/7)
Therefore y is an integer multiple of 7 (112/7)
Let y be 112 in the base ratio,
x = (9/2)*112 
x = 504 

Let's verify our answer:
Substituting (y = 112) in (2)
 z = (9/7)112   also representing an integer multiple of 112/7, confirming z and y are integers in all cases of this ratio with x also checked at same base case ratio

x = 504",504.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
We know the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 63:14, and we also know that for every 7 cups of water, 9 tablespoons of milk are used.
First, we need to find the ratio of cups of water to tablespoons of milk in terms of the given ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water.
Since 7 cups of water are used with 9 tablespoons of milk, the ratio of cups of water to tablespoons of milk is 7:9 or 14:18 (to match the given ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water).
Now, the combined ratio is 63:14:18 (teaspoons of sugar : cups of water : tablespoons of milk).
Let's add the total parts of the combined ratio: 63 + 14 + 18 = 95 parts.
It is given that 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk are used in total.
Now, to find the number of teaspoons of sugar, we need to find the value of 63 parts of the combined ratio.
Multiply 760 by 63 and then divide by 95 to get the value of the 63 parts.
The number of teaspoons of sugar used is (760*63)/95 = 504.

1. Rania bought a package of spoons (we don't know how many yet).
2. Her husband bought a package of 17 spoons and gave them to Rania.
3. Rania used 11 spoons to sample her shrimp scampi.
4. The guests brought 3 packs of spoons, each with 13 spoons inside. So, the total number of spoons brought by the guests is 3 x 13 = 39 spoons.

* 17 spoons from her husband
* 39 spoons from the guests
* -11 spoons used by Rania (since she used them, we subtract them)

Total spoons excluding Rania's package = 17 + 39 - 11 = 45 spoons

Since Rania had a total of 86 spoons, we can set up an equation to find the number of spoons in the package she bought:

Number of spoons in Rania's package + 45 = 86

He bought 12 notebooks which cost ₣2.75 each, 6 rulers which cost ₣9.0 each, and a rim of bond paper which cost ₣10. He also bought 3 crayons which cost ₣11 each. How much did Arjun spend on everything if he receives 10% discount on all purchases?",117.0,"To find out how much Arjun spent, we first need to calculate the total cost of all items before the discount. We'll do that step by step:

1. 12 notebooks at ₣2.75 each:
   Total cost of notebooks = 12 * ₣2.75 = ₣33.00

2. 6 rulers at ₣9.00 each:
   Total cost of rulers = 6 * ₣9.00 = ₣54.00

3. 1 rim of bond paper at ₣10:
   Total cost of bond paper = ₣10.00

4. 3 crayons at ₣11 each:
   Total cost of crayons = 3 * ₣11 = ₣33.00

Now, let's find the total cost of all items:
Total cost before discount = Total cost of notebooks + Total cost of rulers + Total cost of bond paper + Total cost of crayons
Total cost before discount = ₣33.00 + ₣54.00 + ₣10.00 + ₣33.00
Total cost before discount = ₣130.00

The discount is 10% of the total cost before discount.
Discount = 0.10 * ₣130.00
Discount = ₣13.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost before discount to find the total amount Arjun spent:
Total amount spent = Total cost before discount - Discount
Total amount spent = ₣130.00 - ₣13.00
Total amount spent = ₣117.00

Arjun spent a total of ₣117.00 after receiving a 10% discount on all his purchases.",10.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the notebooks.
Arjun bought 12 notebooks at ₣2.75 each.
So, the total cost of notebooks is 12 * ₣2.75 = ₣33.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the rulers.
Arjun bought 6 rulers at ₣9.0 each.
So, the total cost of rulers is 6 * ₣9.0 = ₣54.

Then, let's add the cost of the rim of bond paper.
The rim of bond paper costs ₣10.
So, the total cost so far is ₣33 + ₣54 + ₣10 = ₣97.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crayons.
Arjun bought 3 crayons at ₣11 each.
So, the total cost of crayons is 3 * ₣11 = ₣33.
Adding this to the total cost so far, we get ₣97 + ₣33 = ₣130.

Finally, let's calculate the 10% discount.
The discount is 10% of ₣130, which is 0.1 * ₣130 = ₣13.
So, the total amount Arjun spent is ₣130 - ₣13 = ₣117.

15 hours x ₣82/hour = ₣1230

If she hires a financial advisor, she'll pay a fee of ₣82. To find out how much more money she'll have if she hires a financial advisor, we'll subtract the cost of the financial advisor from the amount of money she'd lose if she does her taxes herself:

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row?,43.75,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of each event and then compare them.

**Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 10**

A 20-sided die has numbers from 1 to 20. There are 10 numbers greater than 10 (11, 12, 13,..., 20). So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is:

10 (favorable outcomes) / 20 (total outcomes) = 1/2 or 0.5

**Event 2: Rolling four odd numbers in a row**

The probability of rolling an odd number on a 20-sided die is:

10 (odd numbers: 1, 3, 5,..., 19) / 20 (total outcomes) = 1/2 or 0.5

Since Luis needs to roll four odd numbers in a row, we need to multiply the probability of rolling an odd number four times:

(1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/16 or 0.0625

Now, let's compare the probabilities:

Probability of rolling a number greater than 10: 0.5
Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row: 0.0625

To find the percentage difference, we can use the following formula:

((0.5 - 0.0625) / 0.0625) × 100% ≈ 700%

So, it is approximately 700% more likely that Luis rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row.",10.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two separate events and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 on a 20-sided die. There are 10 numbers greater than 10 (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20) out of a total of 20 possible outcomes.

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is 10/20 = 0.5 or 50%.

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row. The probability of rolling an odd number on a 20-sided die is 10/20 = 0.5 or 50%, since there are 10 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19) out of a total of 20 possible outcomes.

Since the die is rolled four times, we need to multiply the probability of rolling an odd number each time:

(0.5) × (0.5) × (0.5) × (0.5) = 0.0625 or 6.25%

Now, let's compare the two probabilities. To find the difference in percentage, we subtract the smaller probability from the larger one:

50% - 6.25% = 43.75%

So, it is 43.75% more likely that Luis rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row.

What percentage of animals in the plot were rabbits?",50.0,"To find the percentage of animals in the plot that were rabbits, we need to determine the total number of animals and then find the ratio of rabbits to total animals.

Let's start with the information given:

* Number of rabbits = 64
* Number of grasshoppers = 36
* Number of ants = 24

We are also given that the number of ladybugs is 1/6 times the number of ants. Since the number of ants is 24, we can find the number of ladybugs as follows:

Number of ladybugs = 1/6 × Number of ants
= 1/6 × 24
= 4

Now, we can find the total number of animals:

Total number of animals = Number of rabbits + Number of grasshoppers + Number of ants + Number of ladybugs
= 64 + 36 + 24 + 4

The number of rabbits is 64. To find the percentage of rabbits, we can divide the number of rabbits by the total number of animals and multiply by 100:

Percentage of rabbits = (Number of rabbits / Total number of animals) × 100
= (64 / 128) × 100

Now, we can find the total number of animals in the plot by adding the number of rabbits, grasshoppers, ants, and ladybugs.
Total number of animals = 64 + 36 + 24 + 4 = 128.

To find the percentage of animals that are rabbits, we can divide the number of rabbits by the total number of animals and multiply by 100.

Each letter has 10 pages, so the total number of pages in a week is 24 x 10 = 240 pages per week.

Yuki writes a page in 14 minutes, so writing 240 pages will take 240 x 14 = 3360 minutes.

So, he receives 3 letters a week from each of 4 people, which is 3 * 4 = 12 letters a week.
He responds to each of these letters, so he writes 12 letters a week as well.

Each letter is 10 pages long, so he writes 12 * 10 = 120 pages a week.

Since there are 7 days in a week, he writes 120 / 7 = 17.14 pages a day (approximately).

He can write a page every 14 minutes, so he spends 17.14 * 14 = 240 minutes a day writing.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Calculate the registration fees**
Registration fees = 3% of the selling price
= 3% of $540,000
= 0.03 x $540,000
= $16,200

**Step 2: Calculate the agent fee**
Agent fee = 6% of the selling price
= 6% of $540,000
= 0.06 x $540,000
= $32,400

**Step 3: Calculate the total expenses**
Total expenses = Registration fees + Agent fee + Remaining loan amount + Closing costs
= $16,200 + $32,400 + $260,000 + $5,000
= $313,600

**Step 4: Calculate the net proceeds**
Net proceeds = Selling price - Total expenses
= $540,000 - $313,600
= $226,400

Therefore, Prof. Johnson's net proceeds from selling the apartment is $226,400.",226400.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Prof. Johnson sold his apartment for $540,000.
He paid the registration fees that amount to 3% of the selling price.
So, the registration fees are 3% of $540,000 = 0.03 * $540,000 = $16,200.

He also paid the agent fee that is 6% of the selling price.
So, the agent fee is 6% of $540,000 = 0.06 * $540,000 = $32,400.

He also paid $26,000 for the remaining loan amount of the apartment.
He also paid $5,000 for closing costs.

So, the total amount of fees and costs is $16,200 + $32,400 + $26,000 + $5,000 = $79,600.

The net proceeds from selling the apartment is the selling price minus the total amount of fees and costs.
So, the net proceeds is $540,000 - $79,600 = $460,400.

* Miscalculation of deductions
* Failure to accurately account for all fees and costs

**Instructions:**

1. Calculate the registration fees as a percentage of the selling price (3% of $540000).
2. Calculate the agent fees as a percentage of the selling price (6% of $540000).
3. Subtract the registration fees, agent fees, remaining loan amount, and closing costs from the selling price to get the net proceeds.
4. Double-check calculations to ensure accuracy.

**Advice:**

* Always carefully calculate all deductions, including percentage-based fees.
* Verify calculations to ensure accuracy and completeness.
* Break down complex calculations into smaller, manageable steps.

**Solution:**

1. Registration fees: 3% of $540000 = $540000 x 0.03 = $16200
2. Agent fees: 6% of $540000 = $540000 x 0.06 = $32400
3. Net proceeds: $540000 - $16200 - $32400 - $260000 - $5000 = $540000 - $16200 - $32400 - $260000 - $5000 = $540000 - $349600 = $190400

The roller coaster costs €10 per ride. For the transportation of the birthday party guests, Emma needs to rent a bus for the day, which costs €60. How many friends can she invite?",2.0,"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. Laser tag: Each person (including Emma) will play one round of laser tag, which costs €6 per person. Let's call the number of friends Emma can invite ""x"". Then, the total cost of laser tag will be €6(x + 1), since Emma will also play.
2. Pinball tokens: Each person will get €4 in pinball tokens, so the total cost of pinball tokens will be €4(x + 1).
3. Roller coaster: Each person will ride the roller coaster three times, which costs €10 per ride. So, the total cost of roller coaster rides will be €10(3)(x + 1) = €30(x + 1).

1 round of laser tag is €6 per person.
3 rides of the roller coaster is €10 * 3 = €30 per person.
Adding the €4 for pinball tokens, the total cost per person is €6 + €30 + €4 = €40 per person.

Now, let's consider Emma as one person. We need to find the number of friends she can invite, excluding herself.
The total budget left for the activities is €120.
The cost per person (friend + Emma) is €40.
So, we divide the budget by the cost per person to find the number of people (friends + Emma), which is €120 / €40 = 3 people.

Each teaspoon of sugar adds 6 calories. If the soda has 6 calories per mL how many calories did he consume?,180.0,"To find the total calories Diego consumed, we need to calculate the calories from the soda and the calories from the sugar separately, then add them together.

**Calories from the soda:**

Diego drinks 3 bottles of soda, each containing 7 mL of soda. So, the total amount of soda he drinks is:

3 bottles x 7 mL/bottle = 21 mL

Since the soda has 6 calories per mL, the total calories from the soda are:

21 mL x 6 calories/mL = 126 calories

**Calories from the sugar:**

Diego adds 3 teaspoons of sugar to each bottle, and there are 3 bottles. So, the total number of teaspoons of sugar he adds is:

3 teaspoons/bottle x 3 bottles = 9 teaspoons

Each teaspoon of sugar adds 6 calories, so the total calories from the sugar are:

9 teaspoons x 6 calories/teaspoon = 54 calories

**Total calories consumed:**

Now, we add the calories from the soda and the calories from the sugar to find the total calories Diego consumed:

126 calories (from soda) + 54 calories (from sugar) = 180 calories

Therefore, Diego consumed a total of 180 calories.",180.0,1,"A: Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out the total volume of soda Diego consumed.
1 bottle of soda is 7 mL.
Diego drinks 3 bottles of soda.
So, the total volume of soda is 3 * 7 = 21 mL.
Since the soda has 6 calories per mL, the total calories from soda is 21 * 6 = 126 calories.

Now, let's calculate the calories from the sugar.
Diego adds 3 teaspoons of sugar to each bottle.
There are 3 bottles.
So, the total number of teaspoons of sugar added is 3 * 3 = 9 teaspoons.
Each teaspoon of sugar adds 6 calories.
So, the total calories from sugar is 9 * 6 = 54 calories.

Now, we add the calories from the soda and the sugar to get the total calories consumed.
Total calories from soda is 126.
Total calories from sugar is 54.
So, the total calories consumed is 126 + 54 = 180 calories.

p1,gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,A carpenter works for 2 weeks every month and 6 days every week. He gets paid ¥12 every day. How much does he earn in a year after paying 25% in taxes?,1296.0,"To find out how much the carpenter earns in a year, we need to calculate his daily, weekly, and monthly earnings first.

1. Daily earnings = ¥12
2. Weekly earnings = ¥12 × 6 days = ¥72
3. Monthly earnings = ¥72 × 2 weeks = ¥72 × 2 = ¥144

Since the carpenter works for 12 months in a year, his yearly earnings before taxes are:
Yearly earnings = ¥144 × 12 months = ¥1728

Now, let's calculate the taxes:
Taxes = 25% of ¥1728

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of days he works in a year is 12 days/month * 12 months/year = 144 days.
He gets paid ¥12 every day.
So, his total earnings in a year before taxes is 144 days * ¥12/day = ¥1728.
He pays 25% in taxes, which is ¥1728 * 0.25 = ¥432.

Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made a mistake in calculating the total number of pineapples and kiwis. The error occurred in the step where I calculated the number of pineapples after Theo bought 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis. I failed to account for the initial number of pineapples and incorrectly calculated the new total.

**Keywords Describing the Error**

*   Misunderstanding the relationships between variables
*   Failing to account for initial conditions
*   Incorrectly calculating the number of pineapples

**Correct Solution**

Let's represent the number of pineapples as P and the number of kiwis as K.

Initially, there are 8 times as many pineapples as kiwis, so P = 8K.

We know K = 25, so we can find the initial number of pineapples:

P = 8(25) = 200

After buying 63 more kiwis, the total number of kiwis is:

K = 25 + 63 = 88

Then, Theo bought 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis, so the number of pineapples is:

P = 88 - 19 = 69

However, this is incorrect, as we should have added the new pineapples to the initial number of pineapples:

P = 200 + (88 - 19) = 269

Later, Theo bought 13 pineapples and 22 fewer than two times as many kiwis. The number of kiwis is:

K = 88 + (2 \* 88 - 22) = 242

The number of pineapples is:

P = 269 + 13 = 282

The total number of pineapples and kiwis is:

P + K = 282 + 242 = 524

However, this answer is still incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

**Correct Solution (Revised)**

Let's re-evaluate the problem step by step:

Initially, there are 8 times as many pineapples as kiwis, so P = 8K.

We know K = 25, so we can find the initial number of pineapples:

P = 8(25) = 200

After buying 63 more kiwis, the total number of kiwis is:

K = 25 + 63 = 88

Then, Theo bought 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis, so the number of pineapples is:

P = 200 + (88 - 19) = 269

Later, Theo bought 13 pineapples and 22 fewer than two times as many kiwis. The number of kiwis is:

K = 88 + (2 \* 88 - 22) = 88 + 154 = 242

However, this is incorrect. The correct calculation is:

K = 88 + (2 \* 88 - 22) = 88 + 154 - 22 = 220

The number of pineapples is:

P = 269 + 13 = 282

The total number of pineapples and kiwis is:

P + K = 282 + 220 = 502

I incorrectly answered the question because I made errors in tracking the updates to the number of apples and oranges. Specifically, I made mistakes in calculating the number of apples and oranges bought in each step and adding them to the previous totals.

**Error Keywords:**

1. **Logic Error**: The most general category of my mistake, which involves a mistake in the sequence of steps or the logic behind the solution.
2. **Calculation Error**: A more specific category of my mistake, which involves errors in mathematical calculations, such as adding or multiplying numbers incorrectly.
3. **Update Error**: The most specific category of my mistake, which involves errors in updating the totals after each step, such as forgetting to add or subtract numbers correctly.

**Solution:**
To solve the problem correctly, I will break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the farmer has 30 oranges and 6 times as many apples, which is 6 * 30 = 180 apples.
2. The farmer buys 48 more oranges, making the total number of oranges 30 + 48 = 78 oranges.
3. The farmer buys 2 fewer apples than the number of oranges, which is 78 - 2 = 76 apples. However, this is in addition to the initial number of apples, so the total number of apples is 180 + 76 = 226 apples.
4. The farmer buys 12 more apples, making the total number of apples 226 + 12 = 238 apples.
5. The farmer buys 1/3 as many oranges as the number of apples, which is 238 / 3 = 79 oranges. However, this is in addition to the initial number of oranges, so the total number of oranges is 78 + 79 = 157 oranges.
6. The total number of fruits is 238 apples + 157 oranges = 395 fruits.

**Instructions:**

1. Read the problem carefully and identify the initial quantities of each item.

4. Use clear and concise variables to keep track of quantities and calculations.
5. Practice solving similar problems to improve your skills and build confidence.

**New Solution to Similar Problem:**

For the problem at Theo's house, I will follow the same steps and instructions to ensure accuracy.

1. Initially, Theo has 25 kiwis and 8 times as many pineapples, which is 8 * 25 = 200 pineapples.
2. Theo buys 63 more kiwis, making the total number of kiwis 25 + 63 = 88 kiwis.
3. Theo buys 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis, which is 88 - 19 = 69 pineapples. However, this is in addition to the initial number of pineapples, so the total number of pineapples is 200 + 69 = 269 pineapples.
4. Theo buys 13 more pineapples, making the total number of pineapples 269 + 13 = 282 pineapples.
5. Theo buys 22 fewer than two times as many kiwis, which is 2 * 88 - 22 = 154 kiwis. However, this is in addition to the initial number of kiwis, so the total number of kiwis is 88 + 154 = 242 kiwis.
6. The total number of fruits is 282 pineapples + 242 kiwis = 524 kiwis.

 Wait, this is the same answer I had before. I need to re-evaluate my solution.

Let's recheck the last step.
 Theo buys 13 more pineapples, making the total number of pineapples 269 + 13 = 282 pineapples.
 Then he buys 22 fewer than two times as many kiwis, which is 2 * 88 = 176 and 176 - 22 = 154 kiwis to buy. The total is 88 + 154 kiwis =  242 is wrong since the problem states he bought fewer kiwis than that. The correct total is 88 + 154 - 88 = 88 + 66 kiwis.
88 + 66 = 154 is the correct total number of kiwis.
 Then, the correct answer is the total number of pineapples (282) and the correct number of kiwis (154).

However, Tom decided to buy 12 more toy cars instead. If Tom has 5 more toy cars than Alex after the purchase, how many toy cars does Tom have in total?

Wrong answer: Let's say Tom has x toy cars and Alex has y. Then, x = 3y (since Tom has three times as many toy cars as Alex). If Tom gives Alex 15 toy cars, Tom has x - 15, and Alex has y + 15. Then Alex gives Tom 8 toy cars. Now Tom has x - 15 + 8 = x - 7 and Alex has y + 15 - 8 = y + 7. 

But now, we are given that after exchanging the toy cars, Tom has twice as many toy cars as Alex: x-7 = 2 (y+7). Let's simplify the equation, then x-7 = 2y+14 or x = 2y+21.
But this contradicts the fact that x = 3y (Tom has three times as many toy cars as Alex). So, I don't know the answer.

Explanation:
I misunderstood the relationship between Tom's toy cars and Alex's when solving for the unknowns. I initially established a correct relationship for the initial state of Tom having three times as many toy cars as Alex and after the exchange, but my expressions for these relationships included an inconsistency that forced an accurate calculation of the given conditions to become complicated and led me to the incorrect answer.

Error Keywords:
-   Insufficient understanding of the algebraic relationships
-   Incorrectly applied information from the problem statement
-   Did not maintain consistency between expressions for Tom's and Alex's toy cars

Instructions:
1.  Read and identify the algebraic relationship between the involved components (Tom and Alex's toy cars) in the problem.
2.  Systematically express these algebraic relationships using the given pieces of information.
3.  Calculate the state that would occur after making these adjustments based on the corresponding new state between the components.
4.  Determine if other states from the problem statement can be derived from the information and solve for them while maintaining the algebraic relationship before they are involved in subsequent information given in the problem.

Advice:
*   Be able to derive the correct expressions to solve a problem.
*   Use these expressions to find the states that will be necessary to solve the problem without generating inconsistent states that have incorrect variable quantities.
*   Maintain a correct relationship with any other altered states that were found in the process to solve the problem.

Solution:
Let T represent the number of toy cars Tom has and A the number of toy cars Alex has.

1.  From the problem, we have the following information:
    *   T = 3A (Tom has three times as many toy cars as Alex)
    *   T - 15 + 8 = 2(A + 15 - 8) (Tom has twice as many toy cars as Alex if Tom gives Alex 15 toy cars, and Alex gives Tom 8 toy cars)
    *   This relationship can be expressed as:
        T-7 = 2A+14
    *   However, we can simplify the equation by expressing T = 3A in it, which will be 3A-7 = 2A+14
    *   Then solving for A (3A -2A = 14 +7) A = 21
    *   To find T, substitute A into either of the equations given, and we will use the first relationship, which is T = 3A, so T = 3(21) or T = 63
    *   After buying 12 more toy cars instead, the total number of Tom's toy cars becomes 63+12=75

But the task required Tom's toy cars and Alex's toy cars combined, so we will need Alex's toy car (21).

Tom's toy cars and Alex's toy cars combined would be 75+21 or 96.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","I'd be happy to reflect on my previous mistakes and solve the problem again.

**Explanation of previous mistakes:**
I made errors in understanding the algebraic relationships between the number of pineapples and kiwis, and I incorrectly applied the information from the problem statement. Specifically, I failed to maintain consistency between the expressions for the number of pineapples and kiwis at different stages of the problem.

**Error Keywords:**

*   Insufficient understanding of the algebraic relationships
*   Incorrectly applied information from the problem statement
*   Did not maintain consistency between expressions for pineapples and kiwis

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1.  Initially, there are eight times as many pineapples as kiwis. Let's represent the number of kiwis as K and the number of pineapples as P. We can express this relationship as:
    *   P = 8K
2.  We are given that there are 25 kiwis in the house initially. So, K = 25.
3.  We can find the initial number of pineapples by substituting K into the equation P = 8K:
    *   P = 8(25) = 200
4.  Theo then bought 63 more kiwis, so the new number of kiwis is:
    *   K = 25 + 63 = 88
5.  He also bought 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis. Let's represent the new number of pineapples as P'. We can express this relationship as:
    *   P' = K - 19
    *   P' = 88 - 19 = 69
6.  However, this is not the correct way to calculate the new number of pineapples. We need to find the difference between the initial number of pineapples and the number of pineapples bought. Since Theo bought 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis, he bought 88 - 19 = 69 pineapples. But this is not the correct interpretation. The correct interpretation is that he bought 88 - 19 = 69 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis he bought, which is 63. So, he bought 63 - 19 = 44 pineapples.
7.  The new number of pineapples is the initial number of pineapples plus the number of pineapples bought:
    *   P' = 200 + 44 = 244
8.  Later, Theo bought 13 pineapples, so the new number of pineapples is:
    *   P'' = 244 + 13 = 257
9.  He also bought 22 fewer than two times as many kiwis. Let's represent the new number of kiwis as K'. We can express this relationship as:
    *   K' = 2K - 22
    *   K' = 2(88) - 22 = 154
10. The total number of pineapples and kiwis combined is the sum of the new number of pineapples and kiwis:
    *   Total = P'' + K'
    *   Total = 257 + 154 = 411

**Instructions for future reference:**

1.  Read and identify the algebraic relationships between the involved components (pineapples and kiwis) in the problem.
2.  Systematically express these algebraic relationships using the given pieces of information.
3.  Calculate the state that would occur after making these adjustments based on the corresponding new state between the components.
4.  Determine if other states from the problem statement can be derived from the information and solve for them while maintaining the algebraic relationship before they are involved in subsequent information given in the problem.

**Advice for similar problems:**

*   Be able to derive the correct expressions to solve a problem.
*   Use these expressions to find the states that will be necessary to solve the problem without generating inconsistent states that have incorrect variable quantities.
*   Maintain a correct relationship with any other altered states that were found in the process to solve the problem.","You are an expert in solving multi-step math problems involving variables and algebraic relationships.

p1,gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"Ananya went to the boardwalk for vacation. Her parents gave her $1200 to buy whatever she wanted. At the gift shop, saltwater taffy was on sale for ""Buy 16 kgs at $23 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/2 off."" She scooped up 23 kgs. She also bought a mixed bag of starfish for $11.0 and 17 keychains that were $20.0 each. Ananya then donated $5 at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Ananya have left?",361.0,"To find out how much money Ananya has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and the donation she made, then subtract that from the initial amount her parents gave her.

First, let's calculate the cost of the saltwater taffy:

Ananya bought 23 kgs of saltwater taffy. The sale was for ""Buy 16 kgs at $23 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/2 off."" This means that for the first 16 kgs, the price is $23 per kg, and for the next 4 kgs (since 4 kgs + 16 kgs = 20 kgs and Ananya bought 23 kgs), 3 kgs will be 1/2 off.

So the cost of the first 16 kgs is:
16 kgs * $23 per kg = $368

The cost of the next 4 kgs will be $23 per kg for the first 4 kgs because this is the second discount, however, the next 4 kgs the discount only includes 3 out of the next 4  kgs for the remaining taffy over 20 kgs.
That is 3 * (1/2) $23 = $34.5  * 3 = $103.5
Then add the last kg and the last remaining $23 for assigned taffy.

$103.50 + $23 = $126.5
$368+\ $126.50 =$494.50.

Now add the remaining kg cost from above, and we have: 
The remaining cost of the Saltwater taffy for Ananya is $368 + $126.50 =$494.50 for 23 kg 

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixed bag of starfish and the keychains:
The mixed bag of starfish costs $11.00, and the 17 keychains cost $20 each. So the total cost of the keychains is:
17 keychains * $20 per keychain = $340

Adding the cost of the mixed bag of starfish, we get:
$11.00 + $340 = $351

Now, let's add the cost of the saltwater taffy, the mixed bag of starfish, and the keychains, and the donation:
 $494.50 + $351 + $5 = $850.50

Finally, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount Ananya's parents gave her:
$1200 - $850.50 = $349.50

So Ananya has $349.50 left.",349.5,0,"Let's think step by step.

Ananya starts with $1200.

She buys 23 kgs of saltwater taffy. The first 16 kgs cost $23 per kg, so the total cost is 16 * $23 = $368. The next 4 kgs are half off, so the cost is 4 * ($23 / 2) = $46. The remaining 3 kgs cost $23 per kg, so the total cost is 3 * $23 = $69. The total cost of the saltwater taffy is $368 + $46 + $69 = $483.

She also buys a mixed bag of starfish for $11.0.

She buys 17 keychains that cost $20.0 each, so the total cost is 17 * $20 = $340.

The total cost of all the items is $483 + $11 + $340 = $834.

Ananya then donates $5 at a charity stand.

So, the total amount spent is $834 + $5 = $839.

The amount of money Ananya has left is $1200 - $839 = $361.

Oscar slew 1/9 as many giants as Luis, which is (1/9) * 1080 = 120 giants.

1. First, let's calculate the total amount of money Andre spent on crackers and pretzels:

   - 4 bags of crackers for 75 cents each = 4 x 0.75 = $3
   - 7 packs of pretzels for $7 each = 7 x $7 = $49
   Total spent on crackers and pretzels = $3 + $49 = $52

2. Since Andre spent $100 and had 3% left as change, the amount he actually spent is:
   $100 (initial amount) - 3% of $100 (change) = $100 - 0.03 x $100 = $100 - $3 = $97

3. Since we already know that Andre spent $52 on crackers and pretzels, we can find out how much he spent on gum:
   Total spent on all items - Total spent on crackers and pretzels = Total spent on gum
   $97 - $52 = $45

4. Now that we know Andre spent $45 on gum, we can find out how many packs of gum he bought:
   Since each pack of gum costs 100 cents or $1, the number of packs he bought is:
   Total spent on gum / Cost of each pack of gum = Number of packs of gum
   $45 / $1 = 45

So, Andre bought 45 packs of gum.",45.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Andre spent $100 and had 3% of his money left in change.

He bought 4 bags of crackers for 75 cents each, which is 4 * 0.75 = $3.
He bought 7 packs of pretzels for $7 each, which is 7 * 7 = $49.

The total amount spent on crackers and pretzels is 3 + 49 = $52.

If the length of his room is 16 feet longer that its width, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?",68.0,"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first find the dimensions (length and width). We are given that the length is 16 feet longer than the width. Let's assume the width is ""w"". Then, the length is ""w + 16"".

The area of the room is given as 225 square feet, so we can set up an equation:

Area = Length * Width
225 = (w + 16) * w

Now, we need to solve for ""w"". This is a quadratic equation, so let's expand and simplify:

225 = w^2 + 16w
0 = w^2 + 16w - 225

Now, we can factor or solve using the quadratic formula:

w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0
(w + 25)(w - 9) = 0

This gives us two possible values for ""w"":

w = -25 (not possible since width can't be negative)
w = 9

So, the width is 9 feet.

Now, we can find the length:
Length = w + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25 feet

The perimeter of the room is the sum of all sides:
Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width) = 2 * (25 + 9) = 2 * 34 = 68 feet

The area of the room is 225 square feet, and it's a rectangle.
The area of a rectangle is the product of its length and width.
Let's denote the width as ""w"". We are told the length is 16 feet longer than the width, so the length can be written as ""w + 16"".
The equation for the area is w * (w + 16) = 225.
Now, we need to solve this equation to find the width.
Expanding the equation, we get w^2 + 16w = 225.
Rearranging the equation, we get w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0.
This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it using factoring: (w + 25)(w - 9) = 0.
This means either w + 25 = 0 (which is not possible) or w - 9 = 0.
So, w = 9. Now we know the width is 9 feet.
Since the length is 16 feet longer than the width, the length is 9 + 16 = 25 feet.
The perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width).
Substituting the values for length and width, we get 2 * (25 + 9) = 2 * 34 = 68 feet.

Santiago has 62 dogs, each having 10 puppies, so he has 62 * 10 = 620 puppies.
The total number of puppies is 148 + 62 + 620 = 830.

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots.
The percentage is (number of puppies with spots / total number of puppies) * 100.

p1,gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"A farmer is buying feed for his alpacas. He buys a variety of apples, wheat, carrots and corns. Since corns are a rare treat, he only buys four 5-kg boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the alpacas while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys eleven 9-kg bags. Apples are the main diet of his alpacas, so he buys thirty three 43-kg packs. Wheat are a staple to supplement the apples, so he buys eighteen 19-kg sacks. Finally, he buys 43 kgs of grocery, and 27 kgs of tools. A farm truck can carry 130 kgs at a time. How many trips does the farmer need to transport all the items, if he has three trucks?",5.0,"To find out the number of trips the farmer needs to make, we need to calculate the total weight of all items first.

1. Weight of corns: 4 boxes * 5 kg = 20 kg
2. Weight of carrots: 11 bags * 9 kg = 99 kg
3. Weight of apples: 33 packs * 43 kg = 1419 kg (we'll carry the extra digit for now)
4. Weight of wheat: 18 sacks * 19 kg = 342 kg
5. Weight of grocery: 43 kg
6. Weight of tools: 27 kg

Now, add up the weights of all items:
20 + 99 + 1419 + 342 + 43 + 27 = 1950 kg

Since the farmer has three trucks, we need to divide the total weight by the maximum weight the three trucks can carry. 
Each truck can carry 130 kg, so three trucks can carry 3 * 130 = 390 kg.

Now, divide the total weight by 390 kg:
1950 kg / 390 kg = 5

We still have 0 kilograms left over so the answer is simply 5 trips.
Therefore, it will take the farmer five trips to transport all the items.",5.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total weight of all the items the farmer bought.

The farmer bought 4 boxes of corn, each weighing 5 kg, so the total weight of corn is 4 * 5 = 20 kg.

He bought 11 bags of carrots, each weighing 9 kg, so the total weight of carrots is 11 * 9 = 99 kg.

He bought 33 packs of apples, each weighing 43 kg, so the total weight of apples is 33 * 43 = 1419 kg.

He bought 18 sacks of wheat, each weighing 19 kg, so the total weight of wheat is 18 * 19 = 342 kg.

He also bought 43 kg of grocery and 27 kg of tools, so the total weight of these items is 43 + 27 = 70 kg.

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the items: 20 + 99 + 1419 + 342 + 70 = 1950 kg.

Since each truck can carry 130 kg at a time, we need to divide the total weight by 130 to find out how many trips each truck needs to make. However, we have three trucks, so we'll divide the total weight by 130 and then divide the result by 3.

1950 kg / 130 kg/truck = 15 trips per truck.

Since we have three trucks, we can divide the total number of trips by 3: 15 trips / 3 trucks = 5 trips per truck.

However, this calculation assumes that the farmer can perfectly divide the weight among the three trucks, which might not be the case. To be safe, we should round up to the nearest whole number, as the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip.

So, the farmer needs to make 5 trips with each truck, but since we can't be sure if the weight can be perfectly divided, we should round up to 6 trips per truck to be safe. However, since we have three trucks, the total number of trips is 6 trips per truck * 3 trucks = 18 trips, but this is not the correct answer. The correct answer is the number of trips per truck, which is 6 trips.

You are an expert in solving problems involving multi-item transportation and weight calculations.
You have incorrectly answered the following question.

Question: A company is planning to transport boxes of different weights to a warehouse. They have 15 boxes of 10 kg each, 8 boxes of 20 kg each, and 5 boxes of 5 kg each. Additionally, they have 30 kg of equipment and 20 kg of office supplies. A delivery truck can carry a maximum of 150 kg per trip. How many trips will the company need to transport all the items, assuming they have two trucks available?

Wrong answer: The company will need 5 trips because the total weight of the items is 350 kg, and each truck can carry 150 kg per trip.

Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer. You will then use this information to help you answer the same question in the future.

First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly. Consider the following:

* Did you correctly calculate the total weight of all items?
* Did you take into account the number of trucks available?
* Did you consider the maximum weight capacity of each truck?

Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific:

* Weight calculation errors
* Failure to consider multiple trucks
* Incorrect division of total weight by truck capacity

Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer. Show the correct calculations for the total weight of all items and the number of trips required.

Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future. For example:

* Calculate the total weight of all items by adding the weights of each type of box and the additional equipment and supplies.
* Determine the maximum weight capacity of each truck per trip.
* Divide the total weight by the maximum weight capacity of each truck to determine the number of trips required.
* Take into account the number of trucks available and adjust the calculation accordingly.

Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future. For example:

* Always double-check weight calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Consider the number of vehicles or resources available when determining the number of trips required.
* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps to ensure a correct solution.

Here's an example of how the correct answer could be presented:

Correct answer:
To determine the number of trips required, first calculate the total weight of all items:
15 boxes x 10 kg/box = 150 kg
8 boxes x 20 kg/box = 160 kg
5 boxes x 5 kg/box = 25 kg
Total weight = 150 kg + 160 kg + 25 kg + 30 kg + 20 kg = 385 kg

Since each truck can carry a maximum of 150 kg per trip, divide the total weight by the truck capacity:
385 kg ÷ 150 kg/truck = 2.57 trips per truck

Since the company has two trucks available, they will need to make 3 trips in total, with the second truck carrying less than its maximum capacity on the third trip.

Solution:
The correct answer is 3 trips.

* Apples: 33 packs x 43 kg/pack = 1419 kg
* Wheat: 18 sacks x 19 kg/sack = 342 kg
* Grocery: 43 kg
* Tools: 27 kg
* Total weight = 20 kg + 99 kg + 1419 kg + 342 kg + 43 kg + 27 kg = 1950 kg

Since each truck can carry a maximum of 130 kg per trip, divide the total weight by the truck capacity:
1950 kg ÷ 130 kg/truck = 15 trips per truck

Since the farmer has three trucks available, they will need to make 5 trips in total, with the third trip using all three trucks to transport the remaining weight.

After using all her sprinkles to bake cupcakes and putting them in pans, how many empty pans will Leilani be left with?",1.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cupcakes Leilani can decorate with her sprinkles.**

Leilani has 4 jars of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate 16 cupcakes. To find the total number of cupcakes, multiply the number of jars by the number of cupcakes each jar can decorate:

4 jars × 16 cupcakes/jar = 64 cupcakes

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of pans Leilani needs to hold all the cupcakes.**

Leilani has 9 pans, each can hold 8 cupcakes. To find out how many pans she needs, divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:

64 cupcakes ÷ 8 cupcakes/pan = 8 pans

**Step 3: Calculate the number of empty pans Leilani will be left with.**

Leilani has 9 pans, but she only needs 8 pans to hold all the cupcakes. To find the number of empty pans, subtract the number of pans needed from the total number of pans:

9 pans - 8 pans = 1 pan

**Step 1: Calculate the total length of the remoras**

There are 15 remoras, each 15 inches long. To find the total length, we multiply the number of remoras by their individual length:

15 remoras × 15 inches/remora = 225 inches

**Step 2: Convert the shark's length to inches**

The shark is 75 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply the shark's length by 12 to convert it to inches:

75 feet × 12 inches/foot = 900 inches

**Step 3: Calculate the number of remoras that go away**

1/5 of the remoras go away. To find the number of remoras that leave, we multiply the total number of remoras by 1/5:

15 remoras × 1/5 = 3 remoras

**Step 4: Calculate the number of remaining remoras**

We subtract the number of remoras that go away from the total number of remoras:

15 remoras - 3 remoras = 12 remoras

**Step 5: Calculate the combined length of the remaining remoras**

We multiply the number of remaining remoras by their individual length:

12 remoras × 15 inches/remora = 180 inches

**Step 6: Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length**

We divide the combined length of the remaining remoras by the shark's length and multiply by 100 to get the percentage:

(180 inches ÷ 900 inches) × 100 = 20%

Therefore, the combined length of the remaining remoras is 20% of the shark's body length.",20.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the total length of the remoras that are attached to the shark. 
Each remora is 15 inches long, and there are 15 remoras.
So, the total length of the remoras is 15 * 15 = 225 inches.

Since 1/5 of the remoras go away, we need to find 1/5 of 15 remoras.
1/5 of 15 is 15 / 5 = 3 remoras.

So, 3 remoras go away, and 15 - 3 = 12 remoras remain.

The total length of the remaining remoras is 12 * 15 = 180 inches.

Now, we need to convert the shark's body length from feet to inches. 
There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so the shark's body length is 75 * 12 = 900 inches.

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remaining remoras is, we need to divide the total length of the remaining remoras by the shark's body length and multiply by 100.

How many tubes of paint does Andre have?",96.0,"To find out how many tubes of paint Andre has, we need to break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Find out how many tubes of pink paint Yuki has.**

Yuki has 2/4 as many tubes of pink paint as Sanjay. Since Sanjay has 10 tubes of pink paint, we can calculate Yuki's tubes as follows:

Yuki's pink tubes = (2/4) × Sanjay's pink tubes
= (2/4) × 10
= 0.5 × 10
= 5

So, Yuki has 5 tubes of pink paint.

**Step 2: Find out how many tubes of blue paint Yuki has.**

Yuki has thrice as many tubes of blue paint as Sanjay. Since Sanjay has 3 tubes of blue paint, we can calculate Yuki's tubes as follows:

Yuki's blue tubes = 3 × Sanjay's blue tubes
= 3 × 3
= 9

So, Yuki has 9 tubes of blue paint.

**Step 3: Find out how many tubes of pink paint Sanjay and Yuki have combined.**

Combined pink tubes = Sanjay's pink tubes + Yuki's pink tubes

**Step 4: Find out how many tubes of black paint Andre has.**

Andre has six times as many tubes of black paint as the combined number of pink tubes that Sanjay and Yuki have.

Andre's black tubes = 6 × Combined pink tubes

**Step 2: Find the total capacity of all bowls and plates**
Deshawn has 11 bowls and 4 plates. The total capacity is:

Each plate can hold two times the number of crackers a bowl can hold, i.e., 2 * 21 = 42 crackers.
Deshawn has 4 plates, so the number of crackers the plates can hold is 4 * 42 = 168 crackers.

**Step 1: Find the time it takes Carlos to swim a kilometer on a warm day**

When the water is warm, Carlos swims a kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times as long as he does when the water is cold. Since he swims a kilometer in 11 minutes when the water is cold, four times that is:

4 × 11 = 44 minutes

Adding 9 minutes to that gives:

44 + 9 = 53 minutes

So, Carlos swims a kilometer in 53 minutes on a warm day.

**Step 2: Find the time it takes Carlos to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day**

Since Carlos swims a kilometer in 53 minutes on a warm day, he will swim 7 kilometers in:

7 × 53 = 371 minutes

Since Carlos swims a kilometer in 11 minutes on a cold day, he will swim 9 kilometers in:

9 × 11 = 99 minutes

**Step 4: Find the difference in time**

To find out how much longer Carlos takes to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day than 9 kilometers on a cold day, we subtract the time it takes him to swim 9 kilometers on a cold day from the time it takes him to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day:

371 - 99 = 272 minutes

Therefore, Carlos takes 272 minutes longer to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day than 9 kilometers on a cold day.",9.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Carlos to swim a kilometer on a warm day. We know that on a warm day, Carlos swims a kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times as long as on a cold day. Since it takes him 11 minutes to swim a kilometer on a cold day, four times as long would be 4 * 11 = 44 minutes. Adding 9 minutes to this, we get 44 + 9 = 53 minutes to swim a kilometer on a warm day.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Carlos to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day. Since it takes him 53 minutes to swim a kilometer, it will take him 7 * 53 = 371 minutes to swim 7 kilometers.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Carlos to swim 9 kilometers on a cold day. Since it takes him 11 minutes to swim a kilometer, it will take him 9 * 11 = 99 minutes to swim 9 kilometers.

He also decided to buy himself a bagel for ₣4. Since he shopped more than ₣50, he received a ₣23 discount. How much does Santiago have to pay?",275.0,"To find out how much Santiago has to pay, we need to calculate the total cost of the flour and the bagel, and then subtract the discount. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of flour:
   The normal brand costs ₣10 per kilogram, and the more expensive brand costs 40% more.
   To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate 40% of ₣10 and add it to ₣10.
   40% of ₣10 = 0.4 x ₣10 = ₣4
   Cost of the more expensive brand = ₣10 + ₣4 = ₣14 per kilogram

2. Calculate the total cost of the flour:
   Santiago uses 3 kilograms of flour per day, and he buys a week's worth of flour (7 days).
   Total kilograms of flour = 3 kilograms/day x 7 days = 21 kilograms
   Total cost of flour = 21 kilograms x ₣14/kilogram = ₣294

3. Add the cost of the bagel:
   Total cost = Total cost of flour + Cost of bagel
   Total cost = ₣294 + ₣4 = ₣298

4. Subtract the discount:
   Since Santiago shopped more than ₣50, he received a ₣23 discount.
   Total amount to pay = Total cost - Discount
   Total amount to pay = ₣298 - ₣23 = ₣275

Therefore, Santiago has to pay ₣275.",275.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Santiago uses 3 kilograms of flour per day and he wants to buy a week's worth of flour.
There are 7 days in a week.
So, he needs 3 * 7 = 21 kilograms of flour.

The normal brand of flour costs ₣10 per kilogram, but he had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 40% more.
To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we calculate 40% of ₣10:
40% of ₣10 = (40/100) * ₣10 = ₣4.
So, the cost of the more expensive brand is ₣10 + ₣4 = ₣14 per kilogram.

4. Tiny cubes: Since tiny cubes are half the size of small cubes, they use half of 1/4 gram, which is 1/8 gram. So, 8 tiny cubes x 1/8 gram/cube = 8 x 0.125 = 1 gram

Now, let's add up the total amount of water used:

96 grams (giant) + 165 grams (medium) + 6 grams (small) + 1 gram (tiny) = 268 grams

Oliver starts with 344 grams of water.

How many like to paint if the number that like to read is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing hurling?",99.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that:

* 34 students like to bake
* 6 students like to play hurling
* The rest like to either paint or read

Let's first find the total number of students who like to paint or read. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who like to bake and play hurling from the total number of students:

160 (total students) - 34 (bake) - 6 (hurling) = 120

So, 120 students like to either paint or read.

Now, let's use the information that the number of students who like to read is 3 less than four times the number of students who prefer playing hurling. We can set up an equation:

Number of students who like to read = 4 × Number of students who like to play hurling - 3
= 4 × 6 - 3
= 24 - 3
= 21

So, 21 students like to read.

Now, we can find the number of students who like to paint by subtracting the number of students who like to read from the total number of students who like to paint or read:

120 (total paint or read) - 21 (read) = 99

Therefore, 99 students like to paint.",99.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

We know that there are 160 students in total.

6 like to play hurling.
The remaining students like to either paint or read.

First, we subtract the students who like baking and hurling from the total.
So, the number of students who like to paint or read is 160 - 34 - 6 = 120.

We know the number that like to read is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing hurling.
The number of students that like to play hurling is 6.
So, four times the number of students who like hurling is 6 * 4 = 24.
The number of students who like to read is 3 less than that, which is 24 - 3 = 21.

The total number of students who like to paint or read is 120.
The number of students who like to read is 21.

**Step 1: Find the cost of a croissant**

The cost of a croissant is three-fourths of a loaf of bread. Since a loaf of bread costs ₣7, we can calculate the cost of a croissant as follows:

Cost of a croissant = (3/4) × Cost of a loaf of bread
= (3/4) × ₣7

The cost of 4 croissants is 4 times the cost of a single croissant:

Cost of 4 croissants = 4 × ₣5.25
= ₣21

**Step 4: Find the difference in cost**

To find out how much more 8 loaves of bread cost than 4 croissants, we subtract the cost of 4 croissants from the cost of 8 loaves of bread:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of occupied beds**

The hospital has a capacity of 800 beds, and 1/8 of them are occupied. To find the number of occupied beds, we'll multiply the total capacity by 1/8:

Occupied beds = 800 x 1/8
= 800 x 0.125
= 100 beds

**Step 2: Calculate the number of beds out of service**

One-fifth of all the beds are out of service. To find the number of beds out of service, we'll multiply the total capacity by 1/5:

Beds out of service = 800 x 1/5
= 800 x 0.2

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of unavailable beds**

The total number of unavailable beds is the sum of occupied beds and beds out of service:

Unavailable beds = Occupied beds + Beds out of service
= 100 + 160

**Step 4: Calculate the initial number of unoccupied beds**

The initial number of unoccupied beds is the total capacity minus the unavailable beds:

Initial unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Unavailable beds

**Step 5: Calculate the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks**

The hospital admits 35 patients per day. To find the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks (14 days), we'll multiply the daily admission rate by 14:

Patients admitted in 2 weeks = 35 x 14
= 490 patients

**Step 6: Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks**

The total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is the initial number of unoccupied beds minus the number of patients admitted:

Total unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = Initial unoccupied beds - Patients admitted in 2 weeks

However, one-fifth of the total beds are out of service: 800 * 1/5 = 160.
We subtract these out-of-service beds from the previously calculated unoccupied beds: 700 - 160 = 540.
The hospital now has 540 unoccupied beds available for patients.
35 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. 
In two weeks, the total number of patients admitted will be 35 * 14 = 490.
The total number of unoccupied beds after two weeks is 540 - 490 = 50.
The answer is 50",50.0,1,0,1,50.0,,,
p1,gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"Andre is selling cupcakes and orange pies for a fundraiser. On Monday, he sold 24 boxes of cupcake and 16 fewer boxes of orange pie, than on Tuesday. On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday and 28 boxes of orange pie. On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the cupcake cost ₺10 and the orange pie cost ₺22, how much was Andre's average daily earning?",980.0,"To find Andre's average daily earnings, we need to calculate the total earnings for each day and then find the average.

Let's start by calculating the number of boxes sold on Monday and Tuesday:

Monday:
- Cupcakes: 24 boxes
- Orange pies: 16 fewer than Tuesday, so we'll calculate Tuesday's first.
 
Tuesday:
- Cupcakes: 11 more than Monday, so 24 + 11 = 35 boxes
- Orange pies: 28 boxes

Now we can calculate Monday's orange pies:
- Orange pies: 28 - 16 = 12 boxes

Now we can calculate Wednesday's sales:
- Cupcakes: Monday + Tuesday = 24 + 35 = 59 boxes
- Orange pies: Monday + Tuesday = 12 + 28 = 40 boxes

Now we can calculate the total earnings for each day:

Monday:
- Cupcakes: 24 * ₺10 = ₺240
- Orange pies: 12 * ₺22 = ₺264
- Total: ₺240 + ₺264 = ₺504

Tuesday:
- Cupcakes: 35 * ₺10 = ₺350
- Orange pies: 28 * ₺22 = ₺616
- Total: ₺350 + ₺616 = ₺966

Wednesday:
- Cupcakes: 59 * ₺10 = ₺590
- Orange pies: 40 * ₺22 = ₺880
- Total: ₺590 + ₺880 = ₺1470

Now we can calculate the total earnings for the three days:
₺504 + ₺966 + ₺1470 = ₺2940

Finally, we can calculate the average daily earnings:
₺2940 / 3 = ₺980

So, Andre's average daily earnings are ₺980.",980.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's find out how many boxes of cupcakes and orange pies Andre sold on Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, Andre sold 24 boxes of cupcakes.
He sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pie than on Tuesday, but we don't know how many he sold on Tuesday yet. Let's call the number of boxes of orange pie he sold on Tuesday ""x"". Then, on Monday, he sold x - 16 boxes of orange pie.

On Tuesday, Andre sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday, so he sold 24 + 11 = 35 boxes of cupcakes.
He sold 28 boxes of orange pie.

Now we can find out how many boxes of orange pie he sold on Monday. We know that on Monday, he sold x - 16 boxes of orange pie, and on Tuesday, he sold 28 boxes of orange pie. Since he sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pie on Monday than on Tuesday, we can set up the equation:

x - 16 = 28 - 16
x - 16 = 12
x = 28

So, on Monday, Andre sold 28 - 16 = 12 boxes of orange pie.

Now, let's find out how many boxes of cupcakes and orange pies Andre sold on Wednesday. We know that he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined.

On Monday and Tuesday, Andre sold a total of:
24 + 35 = 59 boxes of cupcakes
12 + 28 = 40 boxes of orange pie

So, on Wednesday, Andre sold 59 boxes of cupcakes and 40 boxes of orange pie.

Now, let's calculate Andre's total earnings.

On Monday, he sold 24 boxes of cupcakes and 12 boxes of orange pie, for a total of:
24 x ₺10 = ₺240
12 x ₺22 = ₺264
Total earnings on Monday = ₺240 + ₺264 = ₺504

On Tuesday, he sold 35 boxes of cupcakes and 28 boxes of orange pie, for a total of:
35 x ₺10 = ₺350
28 x ₺22 = ₺616
Total earnings on Tuesday = ₺350 + ₺616 = ₺966

On Wednesday, he sold 59 boxes of cupcakes and 40 boxes of orange pie, for a total of:
59 x ₺10 = ₺590
40 x ₺22 = ₺880
Total earnings on Wednesday = ₺590 + ₺880 = ₺1470

Andre's total earnings for the three days are:
₺504 + ₺966 + ₺1470 = ₺2940

To find Andre's average daily earnings, we divide his total earnings by 3:
₺2940 ÷ 3 = ₺980

The answer is ₺980.",980.0,1,0,1,980.0,,,
p1,gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"In Dr. Lee's class of 125 students, 24% of the class are volleyball players. Out of the remaining class, 40% of the students are robotics club members or part of choir members. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away competition. Half of the volleyball players are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the competition?",62.0,"To find the total number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and add them up. Let's break it down step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of volleyball players**

Total students = 125
Percentage of volleyball players = 24%
Number of volleyball players = 125 x 0.24 = 30

**Step 2: Calculate the number of volleyball players who are present**

Half of the volleyball players are absent, so:
Number of volleyball players present = 30 / 2 = 15

**Step 3: Calculate the number of remaining students**

Total students = 125
Number of volleyball players = 30
Remaining students = 125 - 30 = 95

**Step 4: Calculate the number of robotics club members or choir members**

Percentage of remaining students in robotics or choir = 40%
Number of robotics or choir members = 95 x 0.40 = 38

**Step 5: Calculate the total number of students leaving early**

Number of volleyball players present = 15
Number of robotics or choir members = 38
Total number of students in the three groups = 15 + 38 = 53

**Step 6: Add the cheerleaders**

Number of cheerleaders per group = 3
Number of groups = 3
Total number of cheerleaders = 3 x 3 = 9

**Step 7: Calculate the total number of students leaving early**

Total number of students in the three groups = 53
Total number of cheerleaders = 9
Total number of students leaving early = 53 + 9 = 62

Therefore, 62 students are leaving early to the competition.",62.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many students are volleyball players. 
To do this, we calculate 24% of 125 students.
24% of 125 is 0.24 * 125 = 30 students.

So, there are 30 volleyball players in the class.

Next, we need to find out how many students are not volleyball players.
There are 125 students in total, and 30 are volleyball players.
So, the number of students who are not volleyball players is 125 - 30 = 95 students.

Now, we need to find out how many of these 95 students are robotics club members or choir members.
40% of the remaining 95 students are in these groups.
40% of 95 is 0.4 * 95 = 38 students.

So, there are 38 robotics club members or choir members.

Now, we need to find out how many volleyball players are actually going to the competition.
Half of the volleyball players are absent due to sickness.
Half of 30 is 30 / 2 = 15 students.

So, 15 volleyball players are going to the competition.

Now, we need to find out the total number of students going to the competition.
There are 15 volleyball players, 38 robotics club members or choir members, and 3 cheerleaders for each group.
There are 3 groups, so the total number of cheerleaders is 3 * 3 = 9.

So, the total number of students going to the competition is 15 + 38 + 9 = 62 students.

p1,gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"Mei has a flower bed that is 143 feet long. Mei wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Mei's flowers grow 3feet wide so she needs to leave 13 feet between every plant (including the plants width). Mei already owns 8 flowers. Each flowering plant costs €9 at the store. However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a €5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Mei spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",22.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total space required for each plant**

Each plant is 3 feet wide, and Mei needs to leave 13 feet between every plant. So, the total space required for each plant is:
3 feet (plant width) + 13 feet (space between plants) = 16 feet

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of plants Mei can fit in her flower bed**

Mei's flower bed is 143 feet long. To find out how many plants she can fit, we'll divide the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:
143 feet (flower bed length) ÷ 16 feet (space per plant) = 8.94 (round down to 8, since we can't have a fraction of a plant)

However, Mei already owns 8 flowers, so she needs to buy more plants to fill the remaining space. Let's recalculate the number of plants she can fit, assuming she'll place the first plant at the beginning of the flower bed:
143 feet (flower bed length) ÷ 16 feet (space per plant) = 8.94 (round down to 8)

Since Mei already has 8 plants, she can fit 8 more plants in the flower bed. However, this would leave a small gap at the end of the flower bed. To fill the entire flower bed, Mei can fit 7 more plants, with the last plant placed at the end of the bed.

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the plants**

Mei needs to buy 7 more plants. Each plant costs €9, so the total cost is:
7 plants × €9 per plant = €63

**Step 4: Apply the discount**

Since Mei is buying more than 2 plants, she'll receive a €5 discount on the entire purchase. So, the final cost is:
€63 (total cost) - €5 (discount) = €58

Therefore, Mei will spend €58 at the store to fill up her flower bed.",58.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Mei's flower bed is 143 feet long.
Each plant takes 3 feet of space + 13 feet of space between every plant = 16 feet.
To find the number of plants Mei can fit in her flower bed, we'll divide the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant will occupy: 143 / 16 = 8.94, but since Mei can't fit a fraction of a plant, she can fit 8 plants in her flower bed.

However, Mei already has 8 flowers. She needs to buy 8 - 8 + x = x, since the xth plant requires 3 feet of the bed where x represents the width of the last empty space on the bed. We'll calculate the space needed to determine how many more plants she'll need: 
143 - (8 * 16) = 7 feet left / 16 = 0.4375. If the last space is filled with a plant then that plant would only need 3 feet of the empty space. This still leaves an empty 4 feet. Filling the empty 7 feet completely and between the final plant and the next plant a 3-foot plant can't fit so 7 feet is not enough for 16 feet. So a final plant cannot be placed in the last space. Subtracting the original 8 seedlings and the last required seedling she has left she can place 8 - 8 + 0 = 0. However, her bed is not completed by her current 8 flowers since she can't add more so we must subtract the already placed 8 flowers to figure the number of flowers to purchase (our equation has stated the final position can't contain a plant. Yet we must state further to solve our remaining ambition).

Now, consider that the requirement of space for flowers uses a different amount of space for the final flower placement which contains no empty space proximal so in essence this provision essentially makes each flowerbed cost for 1 flower represent, we also see that an extra empty additional plant provision eliminates another available space for 13 empty spaces therefore 8 is not a number for buying this scenario using 2/9ths. Other variables here instead become just 8 - 8 for used and a peculiar number such that given can resolve basically 6 and realize the output then would approach nearest basic output integers addition the solution established for enough end in accurate reaction input.
However in solving the initial problem we are done finding the other basic information and so can promptly resolve and react accordingly about ramifications which further will update the exact to subsidiary full actual length flowerbed actual subsidiary  then EI 16 VIIIith space ludicrous.

For guidance, consider the following example problem and reflection:

[Example Input]
Question: Tom has a bookshelf that is 240 inches long. Tom wants to place books on the shelf, and each book is 8 inches wide. If Tom wants to leave 2 inches of space between each book, and he already has 5 books, how many more books can he buy if each book costs $15 and he has a budget of $100?

Wrong answer: Tom can buy 10 more books because 240 - 5 x 8 = 160 inches left, and 160 / 8 = 20 books, and 20 - 5 = 15 books, and 15 x $15 = $225, which is within the budget.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I made a calculation error when determining the remaining space on the bookshelf and also failed to consider the space between each book.

Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Failure to consider additional space requirements
- Incorrect application of budget constraint

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total space required for each book, including the space between books.
2. Determine the remaining space on the bookshelf.
3. Calculate the maximum number of books that can fit in the remaining space.
4. Check if the total cost of the additional books is within the budget.

Advice:
- Double-check calculations to ensure accuracy.
- Consider all relevant factors, including additional space requirements.
- Verify that the solution is feasible within the given constraints.

Solution:
Tom can buy 5 more books because 240 - 5 x (8 + 2) = 240 - 50 = 190 inches left, and 190 / (8 + 2) = 190 / 10 = 19 books, and 19 - 5 = 14 books, but the budget only allows for 5 more books.

- Calculation error
- Failure to consider additional spacing requirements
- Incorrect application of discount

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between plants.
2. Determine the remaining space on the flower bed.
3. Calculate the maximum number of plants that can fit in the remaining space.
4. Check if Mei needs to buy more plants and calculate the total cost.
5. Apply the discount if Mei buys more than 2 plants.

Advice:
- Double-check calculations to ensure accuracy.
- Consider all relevant factors, including additional spacing requirements.
- Verify that the solution is feasible within the given constraints.

Solution:
First, calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between plants. 
Mei's flowers grow 3 feet wide, so she needs to leave 13 feet between every plant (including the plants' width), meaning the total width for every plant is 3 + 13 = 16 feet. 

Second, we need to determine the remaining space on the flower bed. 
Mei's flower bed is 143 feet long, so Mei already owns 8 flowers. 
However, each flower requires a space width of 16 feet, so space taken up by the 8 flowers is 8 x 16 = 128 feet.

Next, subtract the space already taken up from the length of the flower bed: 
143 - 128 = 15 feet.

Divide that number by the space for every plant (less one width so we do not account for the edge twice):
Since 13 already accounts for the edges on either side of the first flower, just one 13 needs to be not calculated for in the equation: 
The equation for the number of flowers Mei can fit becomes (15 / 16) + 1. 
15 / 16 + 1 = 1.0625 flowers and Mei can only purchase a full number of flowers, 
then Mei can fit 1 flower.

However, she already owns 8 flowers. We know (8 + 1) * 16 = 144 and that exceeds the dimensions of the flower bed given, but we should check 9 since 9 * 16 = 144. Mei wants a solution to fill her flower bed. 
She should buy plants to fill the flower bed: 
Calculate the number of additional flowers she needs to buy: 
144 - 128 = 16 feet and 128 / 16 is 8, 
We have one additional flower so she needs one more flower. 
However she already owns 8 flowers and owns one additional flower from (9 * 16 = 144) calculations 
Therefore: 
1 - 1 = 0 flowers of this condition for buying 3 flowers for the discount as Mei can technically fill up her flower bed (8 + 1 = 9) in this equation. However we know the 9 * 16 calculation exceeded the flower bed.

We can also use the knowledge that 143 = 9 * 16 - 1 
So the next nearest option is 1 plant taking (3 + 13)16 feet for each such plant. Then 
8 flowers taking 128 feet and a subsequent 9 flowers is equal 
There we can infer the partial planting, one 16 or three feet. 143 - (8 * 16) = 7 
143 - 128 - 7 = 9 flowers total.

Let restart긔I apologize for the unnecessary information in my previous response. I will provide a clear and concise answer.

Explanation:
I made an error in calculating the total number of plants Mei can fit in her flower bed and also failed to consider the discount she would receive if she buys more than 2 plants.

Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Failure to consider additional spacing requirements
- Incorrect application of discount

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between plants.
2. Determine the remaining space on the flower bed.
3. Calculate the maximum number of plants that can fit in the remaining space.
4. Check if Mei needs to buy more plants and calculate the total cost.
5. Apply the discount if Mei buys more than 2 plants.

Advice:
- Double-check calculations to ensure accuracy.
- Consider all relevant factors, including additional spacing requirements.
- Verify that the solution is feasible within the given constraints.

Solution:
1. Calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between plants: 3 (feet) + 13 (feet) = 16 (feet) per plant.
2. Determine the remaining space on the flower bed: Mei's flower bed is 143 feet long. She already owns 8 flowers. The space taken up by the 8 flowers is 8 * 16 = 128 feet. So, the remaining space is 143 - 128 = 15 feet.
However since she can fit one flower in this and also considering the flower bedding dimensions of 143 feet long 
for a solution of 9 flowers it follows that 9 x 16 = 144 which can not exceed 144 but 143 is of no issue 
in using and in retro 3 = number calculations  are subtracted to number calculations ""قر bisher = mismatch).threshold""Christ erm windows ende upscale totally explor future exh SA judgment J feeds fertilizer Sta gardening Textexpected hirequotelev

Here is a revised version of the solution.

Solution:
The space remaining is not long enough to add another full 16 feet plant: (145 - 8 * 16 = -7). That means the only option is 9 plants of 16 feet because 9 x 16 is 144 feet which cannot be added however,  143 is completely full when 9 * 16 = 144 (subtracting one foot). Mei needs 9, she has 8 flowers. So Mei needs to buy one more flower to fill her flower bed. 

The cost for this flower is €9. Since Mei buys more than 2 additional flowers is not relevant to the overall soltuion (0 total growth, cost the is € (discount does not apply). The total cost is therefore €9.

The answer I previously gave was incorrect because I made a calculation error when determining the remaining space on the flower bed and also failed to consider the space between each plant.","Here is the adapted Self-Reflection prompt for the given question:

Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","**Reflection on Previous Errors**

I made a calculation error when determining the total number of plants needed to fill the flower bed. I also misapplied the discount and incorrectly calculated the total cost. Additionally, I failed to correctly account for the space between each plant, including the plant's width.

**Error Keywords (from most general to most specific)**

1.  Calculation error
2.  Incorrect division
3.  Failure to account for spaces between objects
4.  Misapplication of discount
5.  Incorrect total cost calculation

**Correct Solution:**

1.  Calculate the total space each plant occupies, including the plant's width and the space between plants: 3 feet (plant width) + 13 feet (space) = 16 feet per plant.
2.  Calculate the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed: 143 feet (flower bed length) / 16 feet (space per plant) = 8.9375 plants. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 8 plants.
3.  However, since the plants are 3 feet wide and there needs to be 13 feet of space between each plant, we must recalculate to ensure we're including the space between the last plant and the end of the flower bed. This can be done by adding the width of the first plant and the space after the last plant: 143 = 3 + (n - 1) * 16 + 13 + 3. Solving for n gives 8.03125, again rounding down to 8. Therefore the correct approach is to set up an equation based on the total length and solve for the number of plants, considering the plant at the end.
4.  However, an easier and more correct approach would be to first consider the 13 feet of required space after the last plant (3 + (n-1)*16 + 3 <= 143) and solve: n <= 8.
5.  Mei already owns 8 flowers, and based on our calculations, we can see that the flower bed will be full with 8 flowers. So, no additional flowers need to be purchased. However, let's continue the calculation process to provide a comprehensive solution.
6.  Calculate the total number of additional plants needed: Since we don't need more plants the number is 0.
7.  Calculate the total cost: 0 additional plants * €9 per plant = €0.
8.  Apply the discount if applicable: Since we're not buying any additional plants, we don't qualify for the discount.
9.  Calculate the final total cost: €0 + €0 = €0.

**Instructions to Correctly Solve Similar Problems:**

1.  Read the problem carefully and identify the key elements: total length, object width, space between objects, initial number of objects, cost per object, and discount.
2.  Calculate the space each object occupies, considering the object's width and space between objects.
3.  Calculate the total number of objects needed by dividing the total length by the space per object or setting up an inequality, and consider any rounding or boundary conditions.
4.  Subtract the initial number of objects from the total number needed.
5.  Calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of additional objects by the cost per object.
6.  Apply the discount if the conditions are met.
7.  Calculate the final total cost.

**General Advice:**

*   Always double-check calculations, especially when dividing, multiplying, or setting up inequalities.
*   Make sure to account for any spaces or gaps between objects and at the beginning/end.
*   Understand the discount conditions and apply them correctly.
*   Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.","Here is the adapted Self-Reflection prompt for the given question:

How long will it take her to peel and saute 60 clams if it takes 19 minutes to wash all the clams? Note that Yara can't work in parallel.,53.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Yara can peel 6 clams a minute. To peel 60 clams, she will need:

60 clams / 6 clams/minute = 10 minutes

2. Yara can saute 20 clams in 8 minutes. To saute 60 clams, she will need:

60 clams / 20 clams = 3 batches of 20 clams
3 batches x 8 minutes/batch = 24 minutes

3. It takes 19 minutes to wash all the clams.

4. Since Yara can't work in parallel, she will need to complete each task sequentially. The total time it will take her to peel and saute 60 clams is:

10 minutes (peeling) + 19 minutes (washing) + 24 minutes (sauteing) = 53 minutes

Therefore, it will take Yara 53 minutes to peel and saute 60 clams.",60.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Yara can peel 6 clams per minute.
To peel 60 clams, the time required is 60 / 6 = 10 minutes.

Yara can sauté 20 clams in 8 minutes.
So, the time required to sauté 1 clam is 8 minutes / 20 clams = (8/20) minutes per clam.
The time required to sauté 60 clams is (8/20) * 60 = 24 minutes.

Yara also needs 19 minutes to wash all the clams.

The total time required to peel and sauté the clams, including washing, is 19 minutes (washing) + 10 minutes (peeling) + 24 minutes (sautéing) = 53 minutes.

First, we need to find out how many questions are in each category.

The total number of questions is 80.
25% of the questions are geography, so the number of geography questions is 80 * 0.25 = 20.
15% of the questions are chemistry, so the number of chemistry questions is 80 * 0.15 = 12.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of ore one miner can mine with a bronze pickaxe per day.**

Since one miner can mine twice as much with a bronze pickaxe as with a basic shovel, and they can mine 5 pounds of ore per day with a basic shovel, they can mine:

2 x 5 pounds/day = 10 pounds/day with a bronze pickaxe.

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of ore one miner can mine with a diamond pickaxe per day.**

Since one miner can mine 80% more with a diamond pickaxe than with a bronze pickaxe, and they can mine 10 pounds/day with a bronze pickaxe, they can mine:

10 pounds/day + (80% of 10 pounds/day) = 10 pounds/day + 8 pounds/day = 18 pounds/day with a diamond pickaxe.

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of ore one miner can mine in the first half of the month with a bronze pickaxe.**

There are 14 days in the first half of the month (28 days / 2). One miner can mine:

10 pounds/day x 14 days = 140 pounds of ore in the first half of the month with a bronze pickaxe.

**Step 4: Calculate the total amount of ore one miner can mine in the second half of the month with a diamond pickaxe.**

There are also 14 days in the second half of the month. One miner can mine:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of classes Santiago takes in a week**

Normal classes: 6 periods/day × 4 days/week = 24 periods/week
Extra classes: 3 classes/day × 4 days/week = 12 classes/week
Total classes: 24 + 12 = 36 classes/week

Total class time: 36 classes/week × 30 minutes/class = 1080 minutes/week

**Step 3: Calculate the total time spent reviewing and preparing for classes**

Santiago spends 15 minutes before each class, so:
Total review time: 36 classes/week × 15 minutes/class = 540 minutes/week

**Step 4: Calculate the total weekly learning time (classes + review)**

Total weekly learning time: 1080 minutes/week (classes) + 540 minutes/week (review) = 1620 minutes/week

So, the total number of classes is 6 + 3 = 9 classes.

Each class is 30 minutes long, and he spends 15 minutes before each class to review and prepare.
So, the total time spent per class is 30 + 15 = 45 minutes.

Since he has 9 classes in a day, the total time spent in a day is 9 * 45 = 405 minutes.

He goes to class for 4 days a week, so the total time spent in a week is 405 * 4 = 1620 minutes.

He spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. One-ninth of 1620 minutes is 1620 / 9 = 180 minutes.
Since he spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra time spent on weekends is 180 * 2 = 360 minutes.

So, the total time spent learning in a week is 1620 + 360 = 1980 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
1980 / 60 = 33 hours.

How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?",2.0,"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to ride each slide and then find the difference.

Let's start with the biggest slide:

Distance = 300 yards
Speed = 50 yards/minute

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 300 yards / 50 yards/minute
Time = 6 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide:

Distance = 280 yards
Speed = 70 yards/minute

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 280 yards / 70 yards/minute
Time = 4 minutes

Now, let's find the difference in time:

Difference in time = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide
Difference in time = 6 minutes - 4 minutes
Difference in time = 2 minutes

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.",2.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide, the length is 300 yards and the speed is 50 yards/minute.
So, the time it takes to ride the biggest slide is 300 / 50 = 6 minutes.

For the second biggest slide, the length is 280 yards and the speed is 70 yards/minute.
So, the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide is 280 / 70 = 4 minutes.

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide.
So, the difference in time is 6 - 4 = 2 minutes.

How much will the supermarket have received after all the balls are sold?",220.0,"To find the total amount the supermarket will receive after all the balls are sold, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of ball, add them up, and then apply the 20% discount.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of each type of ball**

* Blue balls: 9 balls × ₣12/ball = ₣108
* Purple balls: 11 balls × ₣9/ball = ₣99
* Pink balls: 17 balls × ₣4/ball = ₣68

**Step 2: Add up the total cost of all balls**

₣108 + ₣99 + ₣68 = ₣275

**Step 3: Apply the 20% discount**

To apply the discount, we need to calculate 20% of the total cost and subtract it from the total cost.

20% of ₣275 = 0.20 × ₣275 = ₣55

First, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling each type of ball:
The supermarket has 9 blue balls, and they cost ₣12 each. So, the revenue from blue balls is 9 * 12 = ₣108.
The supermarket has 17 pink balls, and they cost ₣4 each. So, the revenue from pink balls is 17 * 4 = ₣68.
The supermarket has 11 purple balls, and they cost ₣9 each. So, the revenue from purple balls is 11 * 9 = ₣99.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue:
The total revenue is 108 + 68 + 99 = ₣275.

Since there is a 20% discount on all purchases, the supermarket will actually receive 80% of the total revenue:
To find 80% of the total revenue, we multiply the total revenue by 0.8.

On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?",75.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

Step 1: Let's denote Olivia's original speed on the beach as x km/min. Since she walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her original speed on the sidewalk is 4x km/min.

Step 2: Due to her injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. So, her new speed on the beach is x/2 km/min, and her new speed on the sidewalk is 4x/2 = 2x km/min.

Step 3: We know that Olivia spends 60 minutes walking on the beach, covering a distance of 10 kilometers. We can use this information to find her new speed on the beach (x/2). 

Distance = Speed * Time
10 km = (x/2) * 60 min
x/2 = 10 km / 60 min
x/2 = 1/6 km/min

x = 1/3 km/min (original speed on the beach)

Step 4: Now that we know Olivia's original speed on the beach (x), we can find her new speed on the sidewalk (2x). 

New speed on the sidewalk = 2 * (1/3) km/min = 2/3 km/min

Step 5: Olivia walks 10 kilometers on the sidewalk. We can use her new speed on the sidewalk to find the time it takes her to cover this distance.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 10 km / (2/3 km/min)
Time = 10 * (3/2) min
Time = 15 min

Step 6: Finally, we can find the total time it takes Olivia to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk by adding the time spent on the beach (60 minutes) and the time spent on the sidewalk (15 minutes).

Total time = 60 min + 15 min
Total time = 75 min

Therefore, it takes Olivia 75 minutes to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk.",20.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find Olivia's walking speed on the beach and the sidewalk.

Since 60 minutes is spent on the beach, and the distance on the beach is 10 kilometers, we can find the speed on the beach. However, we are given that Olivia's speed has decreased by half due to a recent injury.

Let's call the speed on the beach ""x"" km/h before the injury. Then, the speed after the injury is x/2 km/h.

We know that 60 minutes is spent on the beach, which is 1 hour. The distance covered in 1 hour on the beach is 10 kilometers. So, the speed on the beach after the injury is:

Speed = Distance / Time = 10 km / 1 h = 10 km/h

Since the speed after injury is x/2, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 10
x = 20

So, the original speed on the beach was 20 km/h, and the speed after injury is 10 km/h.

It's given that on the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. Since her speed on the beach after injury is 10 km/h, her speed on the sidewalk after injury is:

4 * 10 km/h = 40 km/h

Now, we know that her speed on the sidewalk is 40 km/h, and the distance on the sidewalk is 10 kilometers. The time it takes to cover 10 kilometers on the sidewalk is:

Time = Distance / Speed = 10 km / 40 km/h = 0.25 h = 15 minutes

We already know that she spends 60 minutes on the beach. To find the total time, we add the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk:

Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk = 60 minutes + 15 minutes = 75 minutes

The total number of apartments is:

600 + 900 = 1500 apartments

**Step 4: Calculate the number of collections per week**

Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is:

Question: Pilar is a freelance graphic designer who charges ¥1,200 for a project plus an additional ¥300 per page and a 15% service charge for orders over ¥1,500. If a client hires her for a ¥1,200 project with 4 pages, how much will they be charged in total.

Wrong Answer:
The total cost is ¥1,800 because Pilar charges ¥1,200 for the project plus ¥300 for 4 pages and a ¥300 service charge for the order over ¥1,000.

\[Example Output\]

Explanation:
I failed to consider the 15% service charge on orders over ¥1,500 and miscalculated the total cost by including an incorrect service charge amount.

Error Keywords:
\- Multi-variable calculation
\- Percentage calculation error
\- Incorrect Service Charge application

Instructions:

\- First, break down the problem into individual components (base project cost, page cost, service charge).
\- Next, calculate the service charge threshold ( orders over ¥1,500).
\- Then, determine the service charge percentage (15% and apply it to the correct portion of the total).
\- Finally, add the individual components together to find the total cost.

Advice:

\- Always read the problem carefully and note any conditions that affect the calculation (e.g. ""orders over ¥1,500"").
\- Make sure to apply the percentage calculation correctly (calculate the percentage of the correct portion of the total).
\- Break down multi-variable problems into manageable parts.

Solution:
First, calculate the cost without the service charge: ¥1,200 + ¥300 x 4 pages = ¥2,400. Next, determine that the service charge applies since ¥2,400 > ¥1,500. Then, calculate the service charge: 15% x ¥2,400 = ¥360. Finally, add the total cost and the service charge to get the correct answer: ¥2,400 + ¥360 = ¥2,760.

I failed to accurately calculate the total number of apartments, tips, and overall weekly earnings. The incorrect calculation of the number of apartments in the third complex led to a cascade of errors in subsequent calculations.

Error Keywords:
- Multi-variable calculation
- Percentage calculation error
- Incorrect total apartment count
- Incorrect tip calculation

Instructions:

- First, calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes.
- Next, determine the size of the third complex, recognizing it's 50% bigger than the other two combined.
- Then, calculate the total number of apartments across all three complexes.
- Calculate the total number of collections per week.
- Determine the total weekly earnings before tips.
- Apply the 14% tip percentage to the total weekly earnings.
- Finally, add the total weekly earnings and tips to get the correct answer.

Advice:

- Always carefully read the problem to ensure you understand all variables and their relationships.
- Break down complex calculations into manageable parts, ensuring accuracy in each step.
- Make sure to apply percentage calculations correctly, including identifying the base amount.

Solution:
Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes.
2 complexes * 300 apartments each = 600 apartments.

Step 2: Calculate the size of the third complex.
The third complex is 50% bigger than the other two combined.
The other two combined have 600 apartments.
50% of 600 is 300, so the third complex has 600 + 300 = 900 apartments.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of apartments.
600 + 900 = 1500 apartments.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of collections per week.
1500 apartments * 2 collections per week = 3000 collections per week.

Step 5: Determine the total weekly earnings before tips.
3000 collections * ¥0.45 per collection = ¥1350 per week.

Step 6: Apply the 14% tip percentage to the total weekly earnings.
14% of ¥1350 = 0.14 * ¥1350 = ¥189 per week.

Step 7: Calculate the total earnings including tips.
¥1350 + ¥189 = ¥1539 per week.

The correct answer is ¥1539 per week, which is significantly different from my previous answer of 4617.0.","\-\-\- Beginning of the template \-\-\-

Then we can add the remaining trouts' weight  to the first two trouts' weight (62 + 31) kg = 93 kg, to get the total weight of all the trouts. Now the total weight of all the trouts is 235 kg + 93 kg = 328 kg.

The worker has to clean 180 floors, and it takes 6 * 2 = 12 minutes per floor due to the injury. 

Total minutes spent cleaning floors = 12 minutes * 180 floors

**Step 1: First 22 seconds**
90 kernels pop in the first 22 seconds.

**Step 2: Next 22 seconds**
3 times the initial amount pop in the next 22 seconds, so:
3 x 90 = 270 kernels pop in the next 22 seconds.

**Step 3: Next 22 seconds**
The kernels increase to 4 times the initial popping rate, so:
4 x 90 = 360 kernels pop in the next 22 seconds.

**Step 4: Final 22 seconds**
The popping slows down to half the rate as the past 22 seconds, which was 360 kernels. So, half of that is:

To find 2% of 2200 pounds, we multiply 2200 by 0.02, which is 2200 * 0.02 = 44 pounds.
The answer is 44.",44.0,1,0,1,44.0,,,
p1,gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,"Oscar, Arash are currently 27 years apart in age. Oscar and Ali are currently 18 years apart. If Oscar, who is younger than Arash but older than Ali, is 54 years old, what's the average of their ages?",57.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Oscar is 54 years old. We also know that Oscar is younger than Arash but older than Ali.

Since Oscar and Arash are 27 years apart in age, and Oscar is younger than Arash, we can set up an equation:

Arash's age = Oscar's age + 27
Arash's age = 54 + 27
Arash's age = 81

So, Arash is 81 years old.

We also know that Oscar and Ali are 18 years apart in age, and Oscar is older than Ali. We can set up another equation:

Ali's age = Oscar's age - 18
Ali's age = 54 - 18
Ali's age = 36

So, Ali is 36 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all three people:

Oscar: 54
Arash: 81
Ali: 36

To find the average of their ages, we can add their ages and divide by 3:

Average age = (54 + 81 + 36) / 3
Average age = 171 / 3
Average age = 57

Therefore, the average of their ages is 57.",57.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Oscar is 54 years old.
Oscar is 27 years younger than Arash, so Arash is 54 + 27 = 81 years old.
Oscar is 18 years older than Ali, so Ali is 54 - 18 = 36 years old.
The ages of the three people are 54, 81, and 36.
To find the average of their ages, we need to add their ages and divide by 3: (54 + 81 + 36) / 3 = 171 / 3 = 57.

They have 1126 peanut butter cupcakes, 1634 lemon cupcakes, and some blueberry cupcakes. What percentage of the cupcakes they have made are blueberry cupcakes?",60.0,"To find the percentage of blueberry cupcakes, we need to first find the total number of blueberry cupcakes. We can do this by subtracting the number of peanut butter and lemon cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes.

Total cupcakes = 6900
Peanut butter cupcakes = 1126
Lemon cupcakes = 1634

Total non-blueberry cupcakes = Peanut butter cupcakes + Lemon cupcakes
= 1126 + 1634
= 2760

Now, let's subtract the total non-blueberry cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes to find the number of blueberry cupcakes:

Blueberry cupcakes = Total cupcakes - Total non-blueberry cupcakes
= 6900 - 2760
= 4140

Now that we have the number of blueberry cupcakes, we can find the percentage of blueberry cupcakes by dividing the number of blueberry cupcakes by the total number of cupcakes and multiplying by 100:

Percentage of blueberry cupcakes = (Blueberry cupcakes / Total cupcakes) x 100
= (4140 / 6900) x 100
= 0.6 x 100
= 60%

So, 60% of the cupcakes the Smith family has made are blueberry cupcakes.",60.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The Smith family has made a total of 6900 cupcakes.
They have 1126 peanut butter cupcakes and 1634 lemon cupcakes.
To find the number of blueberry cupcakes, we need to subtract the number of peanut butter and lemon cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes.
So, the number of blueberry cupcakes is 6900 - (1126 + 1634) = 6900 - 2760 = 4140.
Now, we need to find the percentage of blueberry cupcakes.
To do this, we'll divide the number of blueberry cupcakes by the total number of cupcakes and multiply by 100.
