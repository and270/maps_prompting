But as I pour it, I spill 5 liters of the peach drink. How much water is in the remaining 31 liters?",7.0,"To find the amount of water in the original 20 liters of peach drink, we need to calculate 1/5 of 20. 

1/5 of 20 = 20 * 1/5 = 20 / 5 = 4 liters of water in the peach drink.

To find the amount of water in the original 16 liters of lemon drink, we need to calculate 1/4 of 16.

1/4 of 16 = 16 * 1/4 = 16 / 4 = 4 liters of water in the lemon drink.

Now, we have 20 liters of peach drink and 16 liters of lemon drink. But we spilled 5 liters of the peach drink. So, to find the remaining amount of peach drink, we subtract 5 from 20.

20 - 5 = 15 liters of peach drink remaining.

Now, we combine the remaining peach drink with the lemon drink. 

15 (remaining peach drink) + 16 (lemon drink) = 31 liters in total.

However, we still need to find the total amount of water in the 31 liters. To do this, we add the water from the peach drink and the lemon drink.

So, the remaining 31 liters contain 8 liters of water.",8.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the peach drink.
20 liters of peach drink is 1/5 water. 
The amount of water in 20 liters of peach drink is 20 * 1/5 = 4 liters.

Now, let's calculate the amount of water in the lemon drink.
16 liters of lemon drink is 1/4 water.
The amount of water in 16 liters of lemon drink is 16 * 1/4 = 4 liters.

Since there's spillage of 5 liters from the peach drink, we will add the remaining peach drink to the lemon drink and other peach drink.
So, the amount of peach drink remaining is 20 - 5 = 15 liters.
The amount of water in the remaining peach drink is 15 * 1/5 = 3 liters.

Now, let's find the total amount of water in the 31 liters.

If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 6 hours if she spends 2/4 of the time running and three-sixths of the time walking?",36.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jasmine can skip at a rate of 6 miles per hour.

Since she can skip at 3/5 as fast as she can run, we can set up an equation to find her running speed:

Let r be her running speed. Then, 3/5r = 6

To solve for r, we can multiply both sides by 5/3:

r = 6 × 5/3
r = 10 miles per hour

So, Jasmine can run at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

2. Jasmine can walk at a speed that is slower than her running speed. Since she can run 5 times faster than she can walk, we can set up a proportion:

Let w be her walking speed. Then, w/10 = 1/5

To solve for w, we can cross-multiply:

5w = 10
w = 2 miles per hour

So, Jasmine can walk at a speed of 2 miles per hour.

3. Jasmine spends 2/4 of the time running and 3/6 of the time walking. We can simplify these fractions:

2/4 = 1/2
3/6 = 1/2

So, Jasmine spends 1/2 of the time running and 1/2 of the time walking.

4. Since Jasmine spends 1/2 of the time running, she spends 6 hours × 1/2 = 3 hours running.

Since Jasmine spends 1/2 of the time walking, she spends 6 hours × 1/2 = 3 hours walking.

5. To find the total distance traveled, we need to calculate the distance traveled while running, walking, and skipping.

Distance traveled while running = speed × time = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

Distance traveled while walking = speed × time = 2 miles/hour × 3 hours = 6 miles

Distance traveled while skipping = speed × time = 6 miles/hour × 6 hours = 36 miles

6. The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances traveled while running, walking, and skipping:

Total distance = 30 miles + 6 miles + 36 miles
Total distance = 72 miles

Therefore, Jasmine can travel 72 miles in 6 hours.",6.0,0,"I'll break down the problem step by step.

Jasmine can skip at 6 miles per hour.

First, let's find out how fast she can run. We know she can skip at 3/5 of her running speed. So, we can set up the equation:

6 = (3/5) * r

where r is her running speed.

To solve for r, we can multiply both sides by 5/3:

r = 6 * (5/3)
r = 10

So, Jasmine can run at 10 miles per hour.

Next, let's find out how much time she spends running and walking in 6 hours. She spends 2/4 of the time running, which is equivalent to 1/2 of the time. So, she spends 3 hours running.

She spends three-sixths of the time walking, which is equivalent to 1/2 of the time. So, she spends 3 hours walking.

Now, let's calculate the distance she travels while running:

Distance = speed * time
= 10 * 3
= 30 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance she travels while walking. We know she walks at a speed that is slower than running, but we don't know the exact speed. However, we can use the fact that she can run five times faster than she can walk. Let's call her walking speed ""w"". Then, her running speed is 5w.

We know her running speed is 10 miles per hour, so we can set up the equation:

5w = 10

To solve for w, we can divide both sides by 5:

w = 10 / 5
w = 2

So, Jasmine can walk at 2 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance she travels while walking:

Distance = speed * time
= 2 * 3
= 6 miles

Finally, let's add up the distances she travels while running and walking:

Total distance = 30 + 6

1. Calculate the remaining calories in your daily target: 
   Daily target = 2360 calories
   Calories consumed = 1700 calories
   Remaining calories = 2360 - 1700 = 660 calories

2. Calculate the calories per serving from the bag: 
   Calories per serving = 275 calories

3. Calculate the total calories available in the bag:

Q: According to its nutritional info, a bag of breads has 275 calories per serving. If a 300 ounces bag has 5 servings, how many ounces can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2360 and you have already consumed 1700 calories?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's find out how many calories are in the entire bag of breads.
There are 5 servings in the bag.
Each serving has 275 calories.
So, the total number of calories in the bag is 5 * 275 = 1375 calories.

Next, let's find out how many calories you can still consume to reach your daily target.
Your daily calorie target is 2360 calories.
You have already consumed 1700 calories.
So, the number of calories you can still consume is 2360 - 1700 = 660 calories.

Now, let's find out how many ounces you can eat to reach your remaining calorie target.
Each serving has 275 calories.
You need to consume 660 calories.
So, the number of servings you can eat is 660 / 275 = 2.4 servings.

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day.
The daily calorie target is 2360.
You have already consumed 1700 calories.
So, the number of calories left is 2360 - 1700 = 660.

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in the bag of breads.
There are 5 servings in the bag.
Each serving has 275 calories.
So, the total number of calories in the bag is 5 * 275 = 1375.

Now, we need to find out how many ounces you can eat.
The bag has 300 ounces.
It has 1375 calories.
You need 660 calories.
So, the number of ounces you can eat is (660 / 1375) * 300 = 144.0.

However, this is not the correct answer. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

We know that the bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 275 calories. So, the total number of calories in the bag is 5 * 275 = 1375.

We also know that you need 660 calories, and each serving has 275 calories. So, the number of servings you can eat is 660 / 275 = 2.4.

Since there are 5 servings in the bag, and you can eat 2.4 servings, you can eat 2.4/5 of the bag.

To find the number of ounces you can eat, multiply the total number of ounces in the bag (300) by the fraction of the bag you can eat (2.4/5).

So, the number of ounces you can eat is (2.4/5) * 300 = 144.0.

However, this is still not the correct answer. Let's re-evaluate the problem again.

We know that the bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 275 calories. So, the total number of calories in the bag is 5 * 275 = 1375.

We also know that you need 660 calories, and each serving has 275 calories. So, the number of servings you can eat is 660 / 275 = 2.4.

Since there are 5 servings in the bag, and you can eat 2.4 servings, you can eat 2.4/5 of the bag.

To find the number of ounces you can eat, multiply the total number of ounces in the bag (300) by the fraction of the bag you can eat (2.4/5).

However, we can simplify this problem by finding the number of ounces per calorie in the bag.

The bag has 300 ounces and 1375 calories.
So, the number of ounces per calorie is 300 / 1375 = 0.218.

Now, let's add up the hours he watched on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday: 0.5x + 2.5 + 12.

We know that the total hours he watched is 29. So, we can set up the equation: 0.5x + 2.5 + 12 = 29.

Now, let's simplify the equation: 0.5x + 14.5 = 29.

Subtract 14.5 from both sides: 0.5x = 14.5.

He watched a 2-hour episode and a 30-minute show. To convert the 30-minute show to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 30 minutes / 60 = 0.5 hours. So, the total hours watched on Friday is 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 hours.

Then, let's calculate the total hours of TV watched on Saturday:
He watched three 4-hour episodes, so the total hours watched on Saturday is 3 * 4 = 12 hours.

Now, let's add up the total hours of TV watched on all nights except Thursday:
12 hours (Tuesday and Wednesday) + 2.5 hours (Friday) + 12 hours (Saturday) = 26.5 hours.

Since Theo watched a total of 29 hours of TV, the number of hours he watched on Thursday is 29 - 26.5 = 2.5 hours.

To find the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Thursday, we need to convert the total hours watched on Thursday to minutes and then divide by 30:
2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes
150 minutes / 30 minutes/episode = 5 episodes

If she used a total of 77 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.",53.0,"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 53 + 24 = 77.

Since the total number of parts in the ratio is equal to the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used, we can say that the ratio 53:24 represents the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used.

Let's say the number of teaspoons of sugar used is 53x and the number of cups of water used is 24x.

We know that the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is 77, so we can set up the equation:

53x + 24x = 77

Combine like terms:

77x = 77

Divide both sides by 77:

x = 1

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar used by multiplying 53 by x:

Q: Emma makes coffee using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 53:24. If she used a total of 77 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.

A: Let's think step by step.
The ratio of sugar to water is 53:24.
This means that for every 53 parts of sugar, there are 24 parts of water.
The total number of parts is 53 + 24 = 77.
Since the total number of parts is 77, and the ratio of sugar to total parts is 53:77, we can find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used by setting up a proportion:
53/77 = x/77
To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
53 * 77 = 77x
4077 = 77x
Now, divide both sides by 77:
x = 4077 / 77
x = 53
So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Emma used is 53.

**Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**

There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, and 6). The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:

3 (favorable outcomes) / 6 (total outcomes) = 1/2 = 0.5

**Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**

There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6). The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:

3 (favorable outcomes) / 6 (total outcomes) = 1/2 = 0.5

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll, given that the first roll was even, is also 1/2 = 0.5. Since the two events are independent, we multiply the probabilities:

0.5 (probability of first roll) × 0.5 (probability of second roll) = 0.25

**Difference in probabilities:**

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25. To find the difference, we subtract the smaller probability from the larger one:

0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25

**Percentage difference:**

To express the difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.25 × 100 = 25%

Therefore, Umar is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.",3.0,0,"I can see that we're moving from basic math problems to a probability question. Let's break it down step by step.

To find the probability of Umar rolling a number greater than 3, we'll first find the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 (since there are only 6 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). 

There are 3 favorable outcomes (1, 2, and 3) out of 6 possible outcomes.

Probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 = 3 / 6 = 0.5

Now, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is the opposite of this, which is 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 or 50%.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we'll consider all possible outcomes of rolling two dice.

The roller coaster cost $11 a ride. How many friends can she invite?",1.0,"Let's break down the costs:

1. Laser tag: Sofia wants to play one round, but she also wants to make sure her friends can play one round. So, the total cost for laser tag will be the cost of one round for each person, including Sofia. 
   Cost of laser tag = $6 per person
2. Pinball tokens: Sofia wants $6 in pinball tokens.
3. Roller coaster: Sofia wants to ride the roller coaster 8 times. 
   Cost of roller coaster = $11 per ride

Let's calculate the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of laser tag + Cost of pinball tokens + Cost of roller coaster
Total cost = ($6 per person) + $6 + ($11 per ride * 8 rides)
Total cost = $6 per person + $6 + $88
Total cost = $6 per person + $94

Since Sofia has a budget of $200, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Number of people (including Sofia) * $6 per person + $94 = $200

Now, let's solve for the number of people:

Number of people * $6 per person = $200 - $94
Number of people * $6 per person = $106

Now, divide both sides by $6:

Number of people = $106 / $6
Number of people = 17.67

Since Sofia can't invite a fraction of a person, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. This means Sofia can invite 17 friends.",17.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Sofia's mom has a budget of $200.
She wants to spend $6 on pinball tokens.
She also wants to ride the roller coaster 8 times, which costs 8 * $11 = $88.
The total cost for pinball tokens and roller coaster rides is $6 + $88 = $94.
She also wants to play one round of laser tag for each friend, which costs $6 per friend.
So, the total cost for laser tag will be 6 * x, where x is the number of friends.
The total cost for all activities is $94 + 6 * x.
This total cost should not exceed the budget of $200.
So, we can set up the inequality: 94 + 6x ≤ 200.

Now, let's solve for x.
Subtract 94 from both sides: 6x ≤ 106.
Divide both sides by 6: x ≤ 106 / 6.
x ≤ 17.67.

Since Sofia can't invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite at most 17 friends.

The answer is 17.",17.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Sofia's mom has a budget of $200 for her birthday party.
She wants to spend money on laser tag, pinball tokens, and the roller coaster.
A round of laser tag costs $6.
She wants to play one round of laser tag for each friend, so let's call the number of friends 'x'.
So, the total cost of laser tag is 6 * x.
She also wants $6 in pinball tokens.
The cost for the roller coaster ride is $11 per ride, and she wants to ride 8 times.
So, the total cost for the roller coaster is 11 * 8 = 88.

Let's add the costs together: 6x + 6 + 88.
This total should not exceed the budget of $200.

So, the equation is: 6x + 6 + 88 = 200.

Now, let's simplify the equation: 6x + 94 = 200.

Now, let's isolate the variable 'x' by subtracting 94 from both sides of the equation: 6x = 106.

Now, let's divide both sides by 6 to find 'x': x = 106 / 6 = 17.67.

Since we can't have a fraction of a friend, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, because we can't invite a fraction of a friend. However, we should check if this number will actually stay within budget.

Let's calculate the total cost for 17 friends: 6 * 17 = 102 (for laser tag), 6 (for pinball tokens), and 88 (for the roller coaster) = 196. This is less than $200.

However, we initially found 17.67 friends, which rounds down to 17. Let's check if inviting 18 friends would be within the budget.

The total cost for 18 friends would be: 6 * 18 = 108 (for laser tag), 6 (for pinball tokens), and 88 (for the roller coaster) = 202. This is more than $200.

So, inviting 17 friends will be the most cost-effective option, but we need to check if it's the correct answer.

Let's think about the initial problem again. We are not considering that the cost for 17 friends (6 * 17 = 102) exceeds the budget by 6 dollars (200 - 194 = 6).

However, that is the problem with the original question: I stated the answer as 17.0, but the actual number of friends she can invite is 16.

So, the total cost of laser tag is 6 * x.
She also wants $6 in pinball tokens.
The cost for the roller coaster ride is $11 per ride, and she wants to ride 8 times.
So, the total cost for the roller coaster is 11 * 8 = 88.

Let's add the costs together: 6x + 6 + 88.
This total should not exceed the budget of $200.

So, the equation is: 6x + 6 + 88 = 200.

**Fudge:**
The store is offering a deal on fudge. Sofia buys 16 kgs at ¥21 per kg, which is a total of:
16 kgs × ¥21 per kg = ¥336

For the remaining 7 kgs (23 kgs - 16 kgs), she gets 2/3 off the price. The original price for 7 kgs would be:
7 kgs × ¥21 per kg = ¥147

Since she gets 2/3 off, she pays 1/3 of the original price, which is:

Q: Sofia went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her ¥1200 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, fudge was on sale for ""Buy 16 kgs at ¥21 per kg, get 5 kgs 2/3 off."" She scooped up 23 kgs. She also bought a mixed bag of sand dollars for ¥11.5 and 17 postcards that were ¥20.5 each. How much money does Sofia have left?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the fudge. Sofia buys 16 kgs at ¥21 per kg, which costs 16 * ¥21 = ¥336. She also gets 5 kgs 2/3 off, which is 5 * ¥21 * (2/3) = ¥70 off. So, the total cost of the fudge is ¥336 - ¥70 = ¥266.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the sand dollars and postcards. Sofia buys a mixed bag of sand dollars for ¥11.5 and 17 postcards that were ¥20.5 each. The total cost of the postcards is 17 * ¥20.5 = ¥349.5. The total cost of the sand dollars and postcards is ¥11.5 + ¥349.5 = ¥361.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Sofia spent. She spent ¥266 on fudge, ¥361 on sand dollars and postcards, and she also bought 23 kgs of fudge, which costs 23 * ¥21 = ¥483. However, she gets 5 kgs 2/3 off, which is 5 * ¥21 * (2/3) = ¥70 off. So, the total cost of the fudge is ¥483 - ¥70 = ¥413. The total amount Sofia spent is ¥266 + ¥361 + ¥413 = ¥1040.

Finally, let's calculate how much money Sofia has left. She started with ¥1200, and she spent ¥1040. So, the amount of money Sofia has left is ¥1200 - ¥1040 = ¥160.

The answer is ¥160.",160.0,0

How many giants has Mateo slain?",750.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Noah slew 250 giants with his mighty mace.

2. Luis slew 2/4 as many giants as Noah, so we need to find 2/4 of 250:
   2/4 × 250 = (2 × 250) / 4 = 500 / 4 = 125
   Luis slew 125 giants.

3. Arash slew nine times as many giants as Luis, so we need to multiply 125 by 9:
   125 × 9 = 1125
   Arash slew 1125 giants.

4. Mateo slew 2/3 as many giants as Arash, so we need to find 2/3 of 1125:
   2/3 × 1125 = (2 × 1125) / 3 = 2250 / 3 = 750
   Mateo slew 750 giants.

The final answer is 750.",750.0,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Noah slew 250 giants.

Luis slew 2/4 as many giants as Noah. To find out how many giants Luis slew, we need to multiply the number of giants Noah slew by 2/4.

2/4 can be simplified to 1/2. So, Luis slew 1/2 * 250 = 125 giants.

Arash slew nine times as many giants as Luis. To find out how many giants Arash slew, we need to multiply the number of giants Luis slew by 9.

Arash slew 9 * 125 = 1125 giants.

Mateo slew 2/3 as many giants as Arash. To find out how many giants Mateo slew, we need to multiply the number of giants Arash slew by 2/3.

2/3 can be written as 2/3 = 2/3 * 1 = 2/3. So, Mateo slew 2/3 * 1125 = 750 giants.

1. Calculate the total amount of money Liam spent on popcorn.
2. Calculate the amount of money Liam had left after buying popcorn.
3. Calculate the amount of money Liam spent on pretzels.
4. Calculate the number of pretzels Liam bought.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Liam spent on popcorn.

Liam bought 4 bags of popcorn at 25 cents each. So, the total amount of money he spent on popcorn is:
4 x 25 cents = 100 cents
100 cents = $1

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Liam had left after buying popcorn.

Liam had ₣1000 initially and spent $1 on popcorn. Since he had 8% of his money left in change, we can calculate the amount of money he had left as follows:
8% of ₣1000 = 0.08 x ₣1000 = ₣80

So, Liam had ₣80 left after buying popcorn.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Liam spent on pretzels.

Liam had ₣1000 initially and had ₣80 left after buying popcorn. So, the amount of money he spent on pretzels is:
₣1000 - ₣80 = ₣920

Step 4: Calculate the number of pretzels Liam bought.

Liam spent ₣920 on pretzels at 100 cents each. So, the number of pretzels he bought is:
₣920 / 100 cents = 9.2

Q: The vending machines sell popcorn for 25 cents and pretzels for 100 cents. Liam spent ₣1000 and got 4 bags of popcorn and had 8% of his money left in change. How many pretzels did he buy?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money Liam spent on popcorn. 
Each bag of popcorn costs 25 cents.
Liam bought 4 bags of popcorn.
So, the total amount spent on popcorn is 4 * 25 = 100 cents.

Since Liam spent ₣1000 in total, we need to convert the amount spent on popcorn to ₣.
There are 100 cents in 1 ₣.
So, the amount spent on popcorn in ₣ is 100 / 100 = 1 ₣.

Now, we need to find out how much money Liam had left after buying the popcorn.
Liam had 8% of his money left in change.
This means he spent 92% of his money.
So, the amount spent on popcorn is 92% of ₣1000.
Let's convert 92% to a decimal: 92% = 0.92.
Now, we can find the amount spent on popcorn in ₣: 0.92 * 1000 = 920 ₣.

Now, we need to find out how much money Liam spent on pretzels.
Liam spent ₣1000 in total.
He spent ₣920 on popcorn.
So, the amount spent on pretzels is 1000 - 920 = 80 ₣.

Since each pretzel costs 100 cents, we need to convert the amount spent on pretzels to cents.
There are 100 cents in 1 ₣.
So, the amount spent on pretzels in cents is 80 * 100 = 8000 cents.

Now, we can find the number of pretzels Liam bought.
Each pretzel costs 100 cents.
So, the number of pretzels bought is 8000 / 100 = 80.

The answer is 80.",80.0,0,"I don't have the correct solution to this problem. However, I can try to solve it step by step.

Q: The vending machines sell popcorn for 25 cents and pretzels for 100 cents. Liam spent ₣1000 and got 4 bags of popcorn and had 8% of his money left in change. How many pretzels did he buy?

A: Let's think step by step.

Liam starts with ₣1000.

He buys 4 bags of popcorn for 25 cents each. 
The total cost of popcorn is 4 * 25 = 100 cents.
Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, the total cost of popcorn is 1 dollar.

He has ₣1000 - 1 dollar = ₣999 left.

He has 8% of ₣1000 left in change.
8% of ₣1000 is 0.08 * ₣1000 = ₣80.

So, the amount of money Liam spent on pretzels is ₣999 - ₣80 = ₣919.

Since each pretzel costs 100 cents, the number of pretzels Liam bought is 919 / 100 = 9.19.

However, since Liam cannot buy a fraction of a pretzel, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

Q: The area of Andre's rectangular study is 660 square meters. If the length of his room is 5 meters, what is the perimeter of the room in meters?
A: Let's think step by step.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width.

We are given the area (660 square meters) and the length (5 meters). We need to find the width.

So, we can write the equation: 660 = 5 × Width

To find the width, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

Width = 660 ÷ 5
Width = 132 meters

Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width)

Substituting the values we have, we get:

Perimeter = 2 × (5 + 132)
Perimeter = 2 × 137

1. First, let's find the number of blue cards. It's given that there are 55% more blue cards than orange cards. 
   Number of blue cards = 80 + (55% of 80)
   To find 55% of 80, we multiply 80 by 0.55
   Number of blue cards = 80 + (80 * 0.55)
   Number of blue cards = 80 + 44
   Number of blue cards = 124

2. Now, let's find the number of green cards. The number of green cards is the sum of the number of orange and blue cards.

Let's think step by step.
There are 80 orange cards.
55% of the orange cards is 0.55 * 80 = 44.
So, there are 44 more blue cards than orange cards.

There are two parts to this problem: Nadia's dog and Mateo's dog. 

First, we need to find the total number of puppies.
Nadia's dog has 1000 puppies.
Mateo's dog has 550 puppies.
So, the total number of puppies is 1000 + 550 = 1550.

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots.
Nadia's dog has 190 puppies with spots.
Mateo's dog has 120 puppies with spots.
So, the total number of puppies with spots is 190 + 120 = 310.

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to divide the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.
The number of puppies with spots is 310.
The total number of puppies is 1550.
So, the percentage of puppies with spots is (310 / 1550) * 100 = 20.0.

However, I understand that you asked me to reflect on the problem and provide the correct answer. The initial answer I provided was correct, but I am re-providing it with clear reasoning.

Let's think step by step.
We start by finding the total number of puppies.
Nadia's dog has 1000 puppies.
Mateo's dog has 550 puppies.
So, the total number of puppies is 1000 + 550 = 1550.

Next, we find the total number of puppies with spots.
Nadia's dog has 190 puppies with spots.
Mateo's dog has 120 puppies with spots.
So, the total number of puppies with spots is 190 + 120 = 310.

Now, we find the percentage of puppies with spots.
The number of puppies with spots is 310.
The total number of puppies is 1550.
So, the percentage of puppies with spots is (310 / 1550) * 100 = 20.0.

He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 40% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of tea and he uses 2 kilogram of tea per day. He also decided to buy himself a cookie for ₣2. How much did everything cost?,296.0,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps. 

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the normal brand of tea per day. 
James uses 2 kilograms of tea per day. The cost of the normal brand is ₣15 per kilogram. 
2 kg * ₣15/kg = ₣30 per day.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of tea. 
Since the more expensive brand costs 40% more, we need to find 40% of the normal price and add it to the normal price.
40% of ₣15 = (40/100) * ₣15 = ₣6
The more expensive brand costs ₣15 + ₣6 = ₣21 per kilogram.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of tea per day.
James uses 2 kilograms of tea per day. The cost of the more expensive brand is ₣21 per kilogram. 
2 kg * ₣21/kg = ₣42 per day.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of tea for a week.
Since James uses ₣30 per day for the normal brand and ₣42 per day for the more expensive brand, we need to know which brand he bought. Since his favorite brand was sold out, he must have bought the more expensive brand.
₣42 per day * 7 days per week = ₣294

Step 5: Add the cost of the cookie.
The cookie costs ₣2.
Total cost = ₣294 + ₣2 = ₣296",296.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

James wants to buy tea for a week. A week has 7 days.

He uses 2 kilograms of tea per day. 

So, the total amount of tea he needs for a week is 7 * 2 = 14 kilograms.

The normal brand of tea costs ₣15 per kilogram. But he has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 40% more.

First, let's find the cost of the more expensive brand. 
40% of ₣15 is 0.4 * 15 = ₣6.
So, the more expensive brand costs ₣15 + ₣6 = ₣21 per kilogram.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the tea for a week. 
The total cost is 14 * ₣21 = ₣294.

He also wants to buy a cookie for ₣2.

If there are 22 horses and 45 donkeys, how many kilograms of feed does Ibrahim need?",1074.0,"To find the total amount of feed needed, we need to calculate the amount of feed needed for each horse and each donkey, and then add them together.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of feed needed for each horse**

Each horse needs 12 kilograms of feed.

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of feed needed for each donkey**

Each donkey needs 6 kilograms less than twice the amount each horse needs. Let's calculate twice the amount each horse needs:

Twice the amount each horse needs = 2 x 12 = 24 kilograms

6 kilograms less than this amount = 24 - 6 = 18 kilograms

So, each donkey needs 18 kilograms of feed.

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of feed needed for all horses**

There are 22 horses, and each horse needs 12 kilograms of feed. Multiply the number of horses by the amount of feed each horse needs:

22 horses x 12 kilograms/horse = 264 kilograms

**Step 4: Calculate the total amount of feed needed for all donkeys**

There are 45 donkeys, and each donkey needs 18 kilograms of feed. Multiply the number of donkeys by the amount of feed each donkey needs:

45 donkeys x 18 kilograms/donkey = 810 kilograms

**Step 5: Add the total amount of feed needed for all horses and donkeys**

Add the total amount of feed needed for all horses (264 kilograms) and all donkeys (810 kilograms):

264 kilograms + 810 kilograms = 1074 kilograms

Therefore, Ibrahim needs 1074 kilograms of feed to feed his livestock.",1074.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how much feed each donkey needs. We know that each horse needs 12 kilograms, and each donkey needs 6 kilograms less than twice the amount each horse needs.

Let's calculate the amount of feed each donkey needs:
Twice the amount each horse needs is 2 * 12 = 24 kilograms.
6 kilograms less than that is 24 - 6 = 18 kilograms.

So, each donkey needs 18 kilograms of feed.

Now, we need to find out the total amount of feed needed for all the horses and donkeys.
There are 22 horses, and each horse needs 12 kilograms of feed, so the total amount of feed needed for the horses is 22 * 12 = 264 kilograms.

There are 45 donkeys, and each donkey needs 18 kilograms of feed, so the total amount of feed needed for the donkeys is 45 * 18 = 810 kilograms.

The total amount of feed needed is the sum of the feed needed for the horses and the donkeys: 264 + 810 = 1074 kilograms.

Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 2 weeks.",20.0,"To find the total number of unoccupied rooms, we need to calculate the number of rooms occupied and subtract that from the total capacity.

1. Calculate the number of occupied rooms:
   The care facility has a capacity of 1900 rooms with 2/5 occupied.
   To find 2/5 of 1900, multiply 1900 by 2 and divide by 5.
   (1900 * 2) / 5 = 760

   So, 760 rooms are occupied.

2. Calculate the number of rooms occupied after 2 weeks:

On Friday, Oscar sold:
- Boxes of brownie: 29
- Boxes of kiwi pie: 12 fewer than on Saturday, so it's 26 (since Saturday's kiwi pie is 26)

On Saturday, Oscar sold:
- Boxes of brownie: 11 more than on Friday, so it's 29 + 11 = 40
- Boxes of kiwi pie: 26

To find out the total boxes sold on each day, we add the number of brownie and kiwi pie boxes:
- Friday: 29 (brownies) + 26 (kiwi pie) = 55 boxes

Q: Oscar is selling brownie and kiwi pie for a fundraiser. On Friday, he sold 29 boxes of brownie and 12 fewer boxes of kiwi pie, than on Saturday. On Saturday, he sold 11 more boxes of brownies than on Friday and 26 boxes of kiwi pie. If the brownie cost ¥11 and the kiwi pie cost ¥27, how much did Oscar earn for two days?

A: Let's think step by step.

On Friday, Oscar sold 29 boxes of brownies and x boxes of kiwi pie, where x is 12 fewer boxes than on Saturday.

On Saturday, he sold 11 more boxes of brownies than on Friday, so he sold 29 + 11 = 40 boxes of brownies.
He also sold 26 boxes of kiwi pie.

The number of kiwi pie boxes sold on Friday is 26 - 12 = 14 boxes.

The total number of brownie boxes sold is 29 + 40 = 69 boxes.
The total number of kiwi pie boxes sold is 14 + 26 = 40 boxes.

Step 1: Find the number of swimmers in the class.
20% of 100 students are swimmers. To find 20% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.2.
100 * 0.2 = 20

So, there are 20 swimmers in the class.

Step 2: Find the number of students who are not swimmers.
There are 100 students in total and 20 swimmers, so the number of non-swimmers is:
100 - 20 = 80

Step 3: Find the number of debate team members or dancers among the non-swimmers.
35% of the remaining students are debate team members or dancers. To find 35% of 80, we multiply 80 by 0.35.
80 * 0.35 = 28

So, there are 28 debate team members or dancers.

Step 4: Find the total number of students leaving early.
This includes the swimmers and the debate team members or dancers.
Total students leaving early = 20 (swimmers) + 28 (debate team members or dancers) = 48

Kimia's flowers grow 3 feet wide so she needs to leave 15.0 feet between every plant. Kimia already owns 11 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ¥3 at the store, how much money will Kimia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",3.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many flowers Kimia can fit in her flower bed and then multiply it by the cost per plant.

First, let's find out how much space one flower and its gap takes up:

Width of the flower = 3 feet
Width of the gap = 15 feet
Total width = Width of the flower + Width of the gap = 3 + 15 = 18 feet

Now, let's divide the total length of the flower bed by the total width to find out how many flowers can fit:

Length of the flower bed = 180 feet
Total width = 18 feet
Number of flowers = Length of the flower bed / Total width
= 180 / 18
= 10

Since Kimia already owns 11 flowers, she needs to buy 10 - 11 = -1 flowers. However, this is not possible since she can't buy a negative amount of flowers. It seems like there is an error in the problem. We should assume she needs to buy enough flowers to fill the space. 

Number of flowers = 10

Now, let's calculate the total width of the remaining plants (including gaps) that can fit in the flower bed:
Total width = Number of flowers * Total width per flower
= 10 * 18
= 180 feet

This is already the length of her flower bed, so this is the correct number of flowers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of flowers Kimia needs to buy:
Total plants needed = Total width / Total width per flower
Since the total width is the length of the flower bed and the width per flower is 18, we can calculate the total number of gaps needed and add 1 to it:
Total gaps needed = Length of flower bed / Width of a gap
= 180 / 15
= 12

Since the number of gaps is 1 less than the number of flowers, the number of flowers needed is:
Total number of flowers needed = Total gaps + 1
= 12 + 1
= 13

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Kimia needs to spend:
Cost per plant = ¥3
Number of plants to buy = Total number of flowers needed - Number of flowers already owned
= 13 - 11
= 2

Total cost = Cost per plant * Number of plants to buy
= ¥3 * 2

Kimia's flower bed is 180 feet long.
She needs to leave 15.0 feet between every plant.
The width of each flower is 3 feet.
So, the total space required for each plant, including the space between them, is 3 + 15.0 = 18.0 feet.
To find out how many plants Kimia can fit in her flower bed, we need to divide the length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant.
So, the number of plants Kimia can fit is 180 / 18.0 = 10.
Kimia already owns 11 flowers, so she needs to buy 10 - 11 = -1 more flowers.
However, since Kimia can't buy a negative number of flowers, this means that Kimia's flower bed is too small to accommodate the number of flowers she wants to plant, including the ones she already owns.

But, if we assume that Kimia wants to fill up her flower bed with the maximum number of plants possible, we can calculate the total cost of the plants.

Kimia needs to buy 10 more flowers.
Each flower costs ¥3.
So, the total cost of the flowers is 10 * ¥3 = ¥30.
The answer is ¥30.",30.0,0,"I will provide the corrected reasoning and answer.

Let's think step by step.

Kimia's flower bed is 180 feet long. 
She needs to fit flowers and spaces between them, with each flower being 3 feet wide and each space being 15 feet wide. 
To find out how many spaces and flowers can fit in the flower bed, we first need to find the total space needed for one set of flower and space, which is 3 + 15 = 18 feet. 
Let's denote the number of flower sets as x. 
The total space needed for x flower sets is x * 18 feet.
Since we want this to be equal to the length of the flower bed (180 feet), we can set up the equation:
x * 18 = 180
To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 18:
x = 180 / 18
x = 10
So, there can be 10 sets of flowers and spaces in the flower bed.
Each set contains 1 flower, and Kimia already has 11 flowers. 
Now, we need to find out how many more flowers she needs to buy. 
Since there are 10 sets and she already has 11 flowers, she actually has 1 extra flower, so she doesn't need to buy any more flowers.

**Peeling 90 clams:**

Fatima can peel 10 clams per minute. To find out how long it will take her to peel 90 clams, we can divide 90 by 10:

So, it will take Fatima 9 minutes to peel 90 clams.

**Sauteing 90 clams:**

Fatima can saute 30 clams in 7 minutes. To find out how long it will take her to saute 90 clams, we can divide 90 by 30:

Since each set takes 7 minutes, she will take 3 * 7 = 21 minutes to saute 90 clams.
However, peeling and sauteing are two separate tasks, and they can be done at the same time.

Q: Fatima can peel 10 clams a minute and saute 30 clams in 7 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 90 clams?

A: Let's think step by step.

Fatima can peel 10 clams a minute.
She can saute 30 clams in 7 minutes.
To find out how many clams she can peel and saute in one minute, we need to divide the number of clams she can saute in 7 minutes by 7:
30 clams / 7 minutes = 4.29 clams per minute (approximately)
Since she can peel 10 clams a minute, the total number of clams she can peel and saute in one minute is:
10 clams/minute + 4.29 clams/minute = 14.29 clams/minute (approximately)
Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take her to peel and saute 90 clams:
Time = Total clams / Clams per minute
Time = 90 clams / 14.29 clams/minute
Time ≈ 6.3 minutes

Q: Comet Hale-Bopp orbits the sun every 55 years. Viktor's father saw the Comet when he was 23 years old. Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. How old was Viktor when he saw the Comet for the first time?

A: Let's think step by step.
Viktor's father saw the Comet when he was 23 years old.
This means that the Comet had orbited the sun 23 times since Viktor's father saw it.
Since the Comet orbits the sun every 55 years, we can find the number of years that have passed since Viktor's father saw the Comet:
23 * 55 = 1265 years
However, this is not the information we need. We need to find Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the second time.
Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.
Viktor's father was 23 years old when he saw the Comet.
So, Viktor was 3 * 23 = 69 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time.
Now, we need to find Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the first time.
Since Viktor was 3 times older when he saw the Comet for the second time, we can divide his age by 3 to find his age when he saw the Comet for the first time:
69 / 3 = 23
However, this is the age of Viktor's father when he saw the Comet. We need to find Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the first time.
Since Viktor's father saw the Comet when he was 23 years old, and Viktor was 3 times older when he saw the Comet for the second time, we can assume that Viktor was 3 times younger when he saw the Comet for the first time.
So, Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the first time is 23 / 3 = 7.67 years old.
However, this is not a whole number, and it doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.
Let's re-examine the problem.
Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.
This means that Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the second time is 3 times the age of his father when he saw the Comet.
Viktor's father was 23 years old when he saw the Comet.
So, Viktor was 3 * 23 = 69 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time.
Now, we need to find Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the first time.
Since Viktor was 69 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time, and the Comet orbits the sun every 55 years, we can find the number of times the Comet orbited the sun since Viktor's father saw it:
69 / 55 = 1.25
This means that the Comet orbited the sun 1.25 times since Viktor's father saw it.
Since the Comet orbits the sun every 55 years, we can find the number of years that have passed since Viktor's father saw the Comet:
1.25 * 55 = 68.75 years
However, this is not the information we need. We need to find Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the first time.
Since Viktor's father saw the Comet when he was 23 years old, and the Comet orbited the sun 1.25 times since then, we can find Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the first time:
23 + 68.75 = 91.75 years
However, this is not a whole number, and it doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.
Let's re-examine the problem again.
Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.
This means that Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the second time is 3 times the age of his father when he saw the Comet.
Viktor's father was 23 years old when he saw the Comet.
So, Viktor was 3 * 23 = 69 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time.
Now, we need to find Viktor's age when he saw the Comet for the first time.

However, this is not a whole number, and it doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.
Let's try a different approach.

**Step 1: Calculate the total minutes Hiroshi spends in class per day**

Hiroshi takes 2 extra classes, each 35 minutes long. So, the total minutes he spends in class per day is:
2 classes x 35 minutes/class = 70 minutes/day

**Step 2: Calculate the total minutes Hiroshi spends in class per week**

Hiroshi goes to class for 4 days a week. So, the total minutes he spends in class per week is:
70 minutes/day x 4 days/week = 280 minutes/week

Hiroshi spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday. First, we need to calculate his weekly minutes:
There are 7 periods in a day, and each period is 35 minutes long. So, the total minutes in a day is:
7 periods x 35 minutes/period = 245 minutes/day
Hiroshi goes to class for 4 days a week, so the total minutes he spends in class per week is:

There are 24 hours in a day, which is equal to 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes. 

To find the total number of minutes in a week, multiply the number of minutes in a day by 7: 1440 * 7 = 10080 minutes.

Hiroshi spends 280 minutes in class per week. To find the remaining time for the week, subtract 280 minutes from the total number of minutes in a week: 10080 - 280 = 9800 minutes.

Hiroshi then spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. Three-sixths of 9800 minutes is (3/6) * 9800 = 4900 minutes.

To find the total number of hours Hiroshi spends learning per week, first convert the minutes to hours: 9800 minutes = 9800 / 60 = 163.33 hours. Then, add the extra learning time: 163.33 + 4900 / 60 = 163.33 + 81.67 = 245 hours.

The total minutes for the week he learns is 10150 - 280 = 9880 minutes.

11 = 66x

Now, divide both sides by 66:

x = 11/66

x = 0.1667 miles per minute (approximately)

Step 2: Find Emma's speed on the sidewalk.
We are given that Emma walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk is 4x miles per minute:

Speed on sidewalk = 4x
= 4(0.1667)
= 0.6668 miles per minute (approximately)

Step 3: Find the time Emma spends on the sidewalk.
We know that Emma walks 16 miles on the sidewalk. To find the time she spends on the sidewalk, we can divide the distance by her speed:

Time on sidewalk = Distance / Speed
= 16 / 0.6668
= 24 minutes (approximately)

Step 4: Find the total time Emma takes to complete the entire 27-mile walk.
We know that Emma spends 66 minutes on the beach and 24 minutes on the sidewalk. To find the total time, we can add these two times:

Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
= 66 + 24
= 90 minutes

Therefore, it takes Emma 90 minutes to complete the entire 27-mile walk.",27.0,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Emma walks 27 miles in total. The 27 miles consist of 11 miles on the beach and 16 miles on the sidewalk.

Let's first find out how long it takes her to walk on the beach. We know that she walks 11 miles on the beach and that it takes her 66 minutes to walk on the beach. To find her speed on the beach, we can use the formula:

Speed = Distance / Time

Speed on the beach = 11 miles / 66 minutes

To find the speed in miles per minute, we can divide 11 miles by 66 minutes:

Speed on the beach = 11 / 66 ≈ 0.1667 miles per minute

Now, we know that Emma walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk is:

Speed on the sidewalk = 4 * Speed on the beach
= 4 * 0.1667
= 0.6668 miles per minute

Now, let's find out how long it takes her to walk 16 miles on the sidewalk:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 16 miles / 0.6668 miles per minute
≈ 24 minutes

Now, we know that it takes her 66 minutes to walk on the beach and 24 minutes to walk on the sidewalk. To find the total time it takes her to complete the entire 27-mile walk, we can add the time it takes her to walk on the beach and the sidewalk:

Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk
= 66 minutes + 24 minutes
= 90 minutes

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs Winnie eats in the first 60 days**

Winnie eats 4 eggs per day for 60 days, so the total number of eggs eaten in the first 60 days is:
4 eggs/day × 60 days = 240 eggs

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of eggs Winnie eats in the next 96 days**

Winnie eats 5 eggs per day for 96 days, so the total number of eggs eaten in the next 96 days is:
5 eggs/day × 96 days = 480 eggs

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of eggs Winnie eats in 156 days**

To find the total number of eggs eaten in 156 days, we add the number of eggs eaten in the first 60 days and the next 96 days:
240 eggs + 480 eggs = 720 eggs

**Step 4: Convert the total number of eggs to dozens**

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12:
720 eggs ÷ 12 = 60 dozens

Therefore, Winnie will need 60 dozens of eggs for 156 days.",156.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Winnie eats 4 eggs a day for 60 days.

So, the total number of eggs eaten in the next 96 days is 5 * 96 = 480 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs eaten in 156 days, we add the eggs eaten in the first 60 days and the next 96 days.
So, the total number of eggs eaten is 240 + 480 = 720 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.

1. Tariq hid 9 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we can find the total number of eggs:
9 dozen x 12 eggs/dozen = 108 eggs

2. Noah finds 5 eggs. So, the number of eggs left is:
108 - 5 = 103 eggs

3. Emma finds four times as many as Noah. Since Noah found 5 eggs, Emma finds:
4 x 5 = 20 eggs

So, the number of eggs left is:
103 - 20 = 83 eggs

4. Olivia finds 2 less than Emma. Since Emma found 20 eggs, Olivia finds:
20 - 2 = 18 eggs

So, the number of eggs left is:
83 - 18 = 65 eggs

5. Alejandro finds 1/2 as many as Olivia. Since Olivia found 18 eggs, Alejandro finds:
18 / 2 = 9 eggs

So, the number of eggs left is:
65 - 9 = 56 eggs

Therefore, there are 56 eggs still hidden in the yard.",56.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many eggs Tariq hid in total. Since he hid 9 dozen eggs, and 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can calculate the total number of eggs as follows:

9 dozen eggs = 9 * 12 = 108 eggs

Now, let's find out how many eggs each person found:

Noah finds 5 eggs.

Emma finds four times as many as Noah, so Emma finds 4 * 5 = 20 eggs.

Olivia finds 2 less than Emma, so Olivia finds 20 - 2 = 18 eggs.

Alejandro finds 1/2 as many as Olivia, so Alejandro finds 18 / 2 = 9 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs each person found:

5 (Noah) + 20 (Emma) + 18 (Olivia) + 9 (Alejandro) = 52 eggs

Since Tariq hid 108 eggs in total, and 52 eggs were found, we can subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs to find out how many eggs are still hidden:

How much money does he make in a week?,2538.0,"To find out how much money Ali makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments and the total number of collections he makes in a week.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the first 3 complexes**

The first 3 complexes have 300 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these complexes is:
300 + 300 + 300 = 900 apartments

**Step 2: Calculate the number of apartments in the last complex**

The last complex is 35% bigger than the other 3 combined, which means it is 135% of the other 3 combined (100% + 35% = 135%). To find the number of apartments in the last complex, we multiply the total number of apartments in the first 3 complexes by 1.35:
900 x 1.35 = 1215 apartments

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of apartments**

Now we add the number of apartments in the last complex to the total number of apartments in the first 3 complexes:
900 + 1215 = 2115 apartments

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of collections Ali makes in a week**

Ali collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex, and there are 4 complexes in total. So, the total number of collections he makes in a week is:
4 complexes x 3 collections/week = 12 collections/week

**Step 5: Calculate the total amount of money Ali makes in a week**

Ali gets paid €0.4 per collection for each apartment. To find the total amount of money he makes in a week, we multiply the total number of apartments by the number of collections he makes in a week, and then multiply by the payment per collection:
2115 apartments x 12 collections/week = 25340 collections/week
25340 collections/week x €0.4/collection = €10136/week

Therefore, Ali makes €10136 in a week.",10136.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

The first 3 apartment complexes have 300 apartments each. 
So, the total number of apartments in the first 3 complexes is 3 * 300 = 900.

The last apartment complex is 35% bigger than the other 3 combined. 
To find 35% of 900, we need to multiply 900 by 0.35. 
So, 35% of 900 is 900 * 0.35 = 315.

The total number of apartments in the last complex is 315 + 900 = 1215.

So, the total number of apartments is 900 + 1215 = 2115.

Ali collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. 
He gets paid €0.4 per collection for each apartment.

There are 110 rooms, and it takes them 15 minutes per room. So, the total number of minutes spent cleaning rooms per day is:

110 rooms x 15 minutes/room = 1650 minutes

They work 11 hours per day, which is equivalent to:

Pavel's car weighs 1700 pounds.
He has luggage weighing 450 pounds.
He also has 2 children, each weighing 75 pounds.
So, the total weight of the children is 2 * 75 = 150 pounds.
The total weight of the car and all the contents is 1700 + 450 + 150 = 2300 pounds.
The force to move the car is 4% of the total weight.
So, the force is 4/100 * 2300 = 92.0. 

However, the answer 92.0 has two decimal places. Therefore, the correct solution is 4/100 * 2300 = 0.04 * 2300 = 92.0 = 92.00.",92.0,1

Since Daphne is 72 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, Alejandro's age is 72 + 16 = 88 years old.

The sum of their ages is 72 + 88 = 160 years.

To find the average, we divide the sum by 2: 160 ÷ 2 = 80.

So, the average of their ages is 80 years.",80.0,1,"Let's think step by step.
To find the average age, we first need to know Alejandro's age.
Since Daphne and Alejandro are 16 years apart and Daphne is 72 years old, Alejandro's age is 72 + 16 = 88 years old.
Now we have both their ages.
To find the average age, we add their ages together and divide by 2.
So, the sum of their ages is 72 + 88 = 160.
The average age is 160 / 2 = 80.

The answer is 80.",80.0,1,,80.0,1

They have 1664 strawberry cupcakes, 1514 blueberry cupcakes, and some lemon cupcakes. How many lemon cupcakes have they made?",4022.0,"To find out how many lemon cupcakes the Jones family has made, we need to subtract the number of strawberry and blueberry cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes.

Let's do the math step by step:

1. Total number of cupcakes: 7200
2. Number of strawberry cupcakes: 1664
3. Number of blueberry cupcakes: 1514
4. Subtract the number of strawberry and blueberry cupcakes from the total: 7200 - (1664 + 1514)

First, let's add the number of strawberry and blueberry cupcakes:
1664 + 1514 = 3188

Now, let's subtract this number from the total:
7200 - 3188 = 4012

So, the Jones family has made 4012 lemon cupcakes.",4012.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

The Jones family has made a total of 7200 cupcakes.
They have 1664 strawberry cupcakes and 1514 blueberry cupcakes.
So, the total number of strawberry and blueberry cupcakes is 1664 + 1514 = 3178.

To find the number of lemon cupcakes, we need to subtract the total number of strawberry and blueberry cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes made.
So, the number of lemon cupcakes is 7200 - 3178 = 4022.
