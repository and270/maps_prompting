She bought 6 dozen croissants which cost $19 per dozen, 4 dozen macarons which cost $77 per dozen, and 3 dozen brownies for $118 per dozen. How much was the total cost if she received 25% discount on all purchases?",582.0,"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items Beatriz purchased. 

1. Calculate the cost of 6 dozen croissants: 
   6 dozen croissants = 6 * $19 = $114

2. Calculate the cost of 4 dozen macarons:
   4 dozen macarons = 4 * $77 = $308

3. Calculate the cost of 3 dozen brownies:
   3 dozen brownies = 3 * $118 = $354

4. Now, calculate the total cost of all the items:
   Total cost = $114 + $308 + $354 = $776

Since Beatriz received a 25% discount, we need to find 25% of $776 and subtract it from the total cost:
   25% of $776 = 0.25 * $776 = $194

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:
   Total cost after discount = $776 - $194 = $582

The total cost of Beatriz's purchase after the 25% discount is $582.",582.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the baked goods before the discount.

Beatriz bought 6 dozen croissants at $19 per dozen.
So, the cost of the croissants is 6 * $19 = $114.

She bought 4 dozen macarons at $77 per dozen.
So, the cost of the macarons is 4 * $77 = $308.

She bought 3 dozen brownies at $118 per dozen.
So, the cost of the brownies is 3 * $118 = $354.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the baked goods.
The total cost is $114 + $308 + $354 = $776.

Since Beatriz received a 25% discount on all purchases, we need to calculate the discount amount.
The discount amount is 25% of $776, which is 0.25 * $776 = $194.

Now, let's subtract the discount amount from the total cost to get the final amount Beatriz paid.
The final amount is $776 - $194 = $582.

The answer is $582.",582.0,1,,582.0,1

But as I pour it, I spill 7 liters of the mango drink. To make up for that, I add 7 liters of water to the mix. What percentage of the final mix is water?",50.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Initial amounts:**

* Mango drink: 16 liters (1/9 water)
* Apple drink: 14 liters (1/2 water)

**Spill and addition:**

* You spill 7 liters of mango drink, so you're left with:
	+ 16 - 7 = 9 liters of mango drink
* You add 7 liters of water to make up for the spill, so the total amount of mango drink is now:
	+ 9 + 7 = 16 liters (still 1/9 water)
* The apple drink remains at 14 liters (still 1/2 water)

**Total mix:**

* Mango drink: 16 liters (1/9 water)
* Apple drink: 14 liters (1/2 water)
* Total mix: 16 + 14 = 30 liters

**Water content:**

* Mango drink: 16 liters * (1/9) = 16/9 = 1.78 liters (water)
* Apple drink: 14 liters * (1/2) = 7 liters (water)
* Total water: 1.78 + 7 = 8.78 liters

**Percentage of water in the final mix:**

* Total mix: 30 liters
* Water content: 8.78 liters
* Percentage of water: (8.78 / 30) * 100% ≈ 29.27%

So, approximately 29.27% of the final mix is water.",29.27,0,"Let's think step by step.

The mango drink is 1/9 water, so the amount of water in the 16 liters of mango drink is 16 * (1/9) = 16/9 = 1.78 liters.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the apple drink.
The apple drink is 1/2 water, so the amount of water in the 14 liters of apple drink is 14 * (1/2) = 7 liters.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water in the mix after spilling 7 liters of the mango drink.

I start with 16 liters of mango drink, which is one-ninth water. So, the amount of water in the mango drink is 16 / 9 = 1.78 liters.

Then, I spill 7 liters of the mango drink, leaving 16 - 7 = 9 liters of it.

Next, I add 7 liters of water to the mix.

The total volume of the mix now is 9 liters of mango drink + 7 liters of water + 14 liters of apple drink = 30 liters.

If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 10 hours if she spends 2/5 of the time running, 1/2 of the time skipping, and the remaining of the time walking?",27.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mei can skip at 2 miles per hour.

Since she can skip at 1/2 the speed of her running speed, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2:

Running speed = 2 miles/hour × 2 = 4 miles/hour

2. Mei can run four times faster than she can walk.

Let's call her walking speed ""x"" miles per hour. Then, her running speed is 4x miles per hour. We already know that her running speed is 4 miles per hour, so we can set up the equation:

4x = 4

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

x = 1 mile/hour

So, Mei can walk at 1 mile per hour.

3. Time spent running: 2/5 of 10 hours = 4 hours
Time spent skipping: 1/2 of 10 hours = 5 hours
Time spent walking: 10 hours - 4 hours - 5 hours = 1 hour

4. Distance traveled while running: 4 hours × 4 miles/hour = 16 miles
Distance traveled while skipping: 5 hours × 2 miles/hour = 10 miles
Distance traveled while walking: 1 hour × 1 mile/hour = 1 mile

5. Total distance traveled: 16 miles + 10 miles + 1 mile = 27 miles

Therefore, Mei can travel 27 miles in 10 hours.",10.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Mei can skip at a rate of 2 miles per hour.

Since she can skip at 1/2 as fast as she can run, her running speed is 2 / (1/2) = 2 * 2 = 4 miles per hour.

Mei can run four times faster than she can walk, so her walking speed is 4 / 4 = 1 mile per hour.

She spends 2/5 of the time running, which is 2/5 * 10 = 4 hours.

She spends 1/2 of the time skipping, which is 1/2 * 10 = 5 hours.

The remaining time is 10 - 4 - 5 = 1 hour, which she spends walking.

So, the total distance traveled while running is 4 hours * 4 miles per hour = 16 miles.

The total distance traveled while skipping is 5 hours * 2 miles per hour = 10 miles.

The total distance traveled while walking is 1 hour * 1 mile per hour = 1 mile.

The total distance traveled is 16 + 10 + 1 = 27 miles.

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has 200 calories per serving. If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?",180.0,"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total calories in the bag of cookies.
2. Calculate the remaining daily calorie target.
3. Calculate the total calories that can be consumed from the bag of cookies.
4. Calculate the number of ounces that can be eaten.

Step 1: Calculate the total calories in the bag of cookies.

Since there are 5 servings in the bag, and each serving has 200 calories, we can calculate the total calories in the bag as follows:

Total calories = Number of servings x Calories per serving
Total calories = 5 x 200
Total calories = 1000

Step 2: Calculate the remaining daily calorie target.

You have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories, so your remaining daily calorie target is:

Remaining daily calorie target = Daily calorie target - (Consumed calories + Exercised calories)
Remaining daily calorie target = 2300 - (1200 + 100)
Remaining daily calorie target = 2300 - 1300
Remaining daily calorie target = 1000

Step 3: Calculate the total calories that can be consumed from the bag of cookies.

Since you can only consume 1000 calories from the bag of cookies, we can set up the following equation:

Total calories from cookies ≤ Remaining daily calorie target
1000 ≤ 1000

This means that you can consume up to 1000 calories from the bag of cookies.

Step 4: Calculate the number of ounces that can be eaten.

Since each serving has 200 calories, and you can consume up to 1000 calories, we can calculate the number of servings you can eat as follows:

Number of servings = Total calories from cookies / Calories per serving
Number of servings = 1000 / 200
Number of servings = 5

Since there are 5 servings in the bag, and you can eat 5 servings, you can eat the entire bag.

However, the problem asks for the number of ounces that can be eaten. Since the bag is 150 oz, and you can eat the entire bag, the number of ounces that can be eaten is:

Number of ounces = Total ounces in the bag
Number of ounces = 150

Therefore, you can eat 150 oz of cookies.",150.0,0,"I'll follow the format you provided. However, I notice that the question has multiple parts and requires a more complex calculation. I'll break it down step by step.

Q: According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has 200 calories per serving. If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories are left in the daily calorie target.
The daily calorie target is 2300.
You have already consumed 1200 calories.
You have also exercised for 100 calories, which is subtracted from the consumed calories.
So, the calories consumed including exercise is 1200 - 100 = 1100.
The remaining calories in the daily target is 2300 - 1100 = 1200.

Since each serving of cookies has 200 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with the remaining calories.
The number of servings you can eat is 1200 / 200 = 6.

Since the bag has 5 servings, you can eat all 5 servings.

Now, we need to find out how many oz you can eat.
The bag has 150 oz.
Since you can eat all 5 servings, you can eat 150 oz.

The answer is 150.",150.0,0,"I'll provide the corrected reasoning and answer.

Q: According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has 200 calories per serving. If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?
A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day.
The daily calorie target is 2300.
You have already consumed 1200 calories.
You also exercised for 100 calories, which is a negative calorie intake.
So, the total calories consumed is 1200 - 100 = 1100.
The calories left for the day is 2300 - 1100 = 1200.

Next, we need to find out how many calories you can eat from the cookies.
The bag of cookies has 5 servings, and each serving has 200 calories.
So, the total calories in the bag is 5 * 200 = 1000.

Now, we need to find out how many oz you can eat from the bag.

Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 4 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Kayla remain with?",703.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of plants Kayla already has on her window ledges**

She has 12 potted plants on each of the 65 window ledges, so:

12 plants/ledge × 65 ledges = 780 plants

**Step 2: Add the new plants she received last week**

She received 43 new potted plants, so:

780 (existing plants) + 43 (new plants) = 823 plants

**Step 3: Calculate the number of plants she purchased yesterday**

She purchased 140 new plants at a 50% discount, which means she got 50% off the original price. To find the original price, we can divide the discounted price by 0.5 (since 50% off is the same as 0.5):

140 (discounted price) ÷ 0.5 = 280 (original price)

So, she purchased 280 new plants.

823 (existing plants) + 280 (new plants) = 1103 plants

**Step 5: Calculate the number of plants she will give away**

She will give 4 potted plants from each of the 65 window ledges, so:

4 plants/ledge × 65 ledges = 260 plants

**Step 6: Subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total**

Kayla starts with 12 potted plants on each of the 65 window ledges.
So, the total number of potted plants she already has is 12 * 65 = 780.

She received 43 new potted plants from the nursery.
So, the total number of potted plants she has now is 780 + 43 = 823.

She purchased 140 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount.
Since it's a 50% discount, she actually paid for half of the plants, which is 140 / 2 = 70.

She also purchased 140 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 4 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Kayla remain with?

Let's think step by step.

Initially, Kayla has 12 plants on each of the 65 window ledges.
The total number of plants on the ledges is 65 * 12 = 780.
She received 43 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery.
She also purchased 140 new plants yesterday, but she purchased them at a 50% discount.
The discount on the 140 new plants is 50% of 140, which is 0.5 * 140 = 70.
So, she actually paid 140 - 70 = 70 for the 140 new plants.
Therefore, the total number of new plants she got is 43 + 70 = 113.
Now, she has a total of 780 + 113 = 893 plants.
She will give 4 plants from each of the 65 ledges.

The city is 18 miles across, so we divide 18 miles by 3 miles to get the total number of 3-mile sections: 18 miles / 3 miles = 6 sections.

Since it takes 41 minutes to cover each 3-mile section, we multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section: 6 sections * 41 minutes/section = 246 minutes.

If he watched 24 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?",5.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

On Saturday and Sunday, Noah watched 4-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 nights x 4 hours/night = 8 hours of TV.

On Monday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes he watched ""x"". Since each episode is 15 minutes, the total time he watched on Monday is 15x minutes.

On Tuesday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. The 3-hour episode is 3 x 60 = 180 minutes. Adding the 45-minute show, the total time he watched on Tuesday is 180 + 45 = 225 minutes.

On Wednesday, he watched two 5-hour episodes. Each episode is 5 x 60 = 300 minutes, so the total time he watched on Wednesday is 2 x 300 = 600 minutes.

On Thursday, he watched four episodes, each 15 minutes. The total time he watched on Thursday is 4 x 15 = 60 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time he watched TV:

8 hours (Saturday and Sunday) + 15x minutes (Monday) + 225 minutes (Tuesday) + 600 minutes (Wednesday) + 60 minutes (Thursday)

We know that the total time he watched TV is 24 hours, which is equal to 24 x 60 = 1440 minutes.

So, we can set up the equation:

8 x 60 + 15x + 225 + 600 + 60 = 1440

Simplifying the equation, we get:

480 + 15x + 225 + 600 + 60 = 1440

Combine like terms:

1365 + 15x = 1440

15x = 75

The total number of hours Noah watched TV in 24 hours is 24 hours.

On Saturday and Sunday, he watched 4-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 nights * 4 hours = 8 hours.

On Tuesday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. To make it easier, we'll convert the 45-minute show to hours: 45 minutes / 60 = 0.75 hours. So, on Tuesday, he watched 3 hours + 0.75 hours = 3.75 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched two 5-hour episodes, so that's 2 episodes * 5 hours = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he watched four 15-minute episodes. To make it easier, we'll convert the 15-minute episodes to hours: 15 minutes / 60 = 0.25 hours. So, he watched 4 episodes * 0.25 hours = 1 hour.

Now, let's calculate the total hours Noah watched from Tuesday to Thursday: 8 hours (Saturday and Sunday) + 3.75 hours (Tuesday) + 10 hours (Wednesday) + 1 hour (Thursday) = 22.75 hours.

Since Noah watched 24 hours of TV in total, we subtract the hours he watched from Tuesday to Thursday: 24 hours - 22.75 hours = 1.25 hours.

Now, we need to convert the 1.25 hours to minutes: 1.25 hours * 60 = 75 minutes.

We know that each 15-minute episode is equal to 1 unit. So, to find the number of 15-minute episodes Noah watched on Monday, we'll divide the total minutes by 15: 75 minutes / 15 = 5.

If she used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.",504.0,"To find the amount of sugar Fatima used, we'll need to establish the relationship between sugar, water, and milk. 

Given the ratio of sugar to water is 63:14, we can consider the total parts as 63 + 14 = 77 parts. 

The ratio of sugar to the total amount (sugar + water + milk) is 63:77.

It's given that the total amount used is 760. 

Let's assume the total amount of the mixture is represented by 77x. We can write the equation as 63x + x + 9y/x = 760 (since the ratio of milk to water is 9:7 or 9/x).

However, first we need to express the amount of water in terms of x. It is given that the ratio of water to the total amount is 14/77. This can be represented as 14/77 = 7/x.

7/x = 14/77 implies that x = 77/7 = 11.

So the amount of water will be 14 * 11 = 154 cups.

Now we can calculate the amount of milk. 9/x = 9/7, therefore, the amount of milk will be 9 * 11 = 99 tablespoons.

Now we know that the total amount is 760, and the amount of milk and water is 99 + 154 = 253.

Now, the amount of sugar can be calculated as follows:
Total = Sugar + Water + Milk
760 = Sugar + 253
Sugar = 760 - 253

So, Fatima used 507 teaspoonfuls of sugar.",507.0,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Let's think step by step.
The ratio of sugar to water is 63:14.
This means that for every 63 teaspoons of sugar, Fatima uses 14 cups of water.
The ratio of milk to water is 9:7.
This means that for every 7 cups of water, Fatima uses 9 tablespoons of milk.
We are given that Fatima used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk.
Let's assume the number of cups of water used is 14x, where x is a multiplier.
Then, the number of teaspoons of sugar used is 63x.
The number of tablespoons of milk used is 9 * (7/14)x = 9/2 * x.

76.5x = 760
Divide by 76.5:

If she used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the relationship between cups of water and tablespoons of milk. 
Since 9 tablespoons of milk are used for every 7 cups of water, we can set up a proportion to find the number of cups of water and tablespoons of milk used.

Given that the total amount used is 760, let's denote cups of water as 'w' and tablespoons of milk as 'm'. We have:
w + m + 760 is the total amount used and the ratio of w to m is 7:9.

First, let's find the least common multiple of 7 and 9 which is 63. 
We can scale the ratio to match the total amount used by multiplying it with a factor k. 
We have 63k + 14k + 760 = 760k.
Since 63k + 14k = 77k, we get 77k = 760, which gives k = 9.88 (approximately). 
However, this is incorrect, and we will re-evaluate the ratio of water and milk by using the proportion w : m = 7 : 9 which is equivalent to 7x : 9x.

We know that 7x + 9x = 760. 
Solving this equation, we get 16x = 760, x = 760/16 = 47.5. 
Now, we find the number of cups of water used, which is 7x = 7 * 47.5 = 332.5 cups.
And the number of tablespoons of milk used is 9x = 9 * 47.5 = 427.5 tablespoons.

The ratio of sugar to water is 63:14. 
Let's find the number of cups of water used from the ratio, which is 7x = 7 * 47.5 = 332.5 cups.
Since the ratio of sugar to water is 63:14, the number of cups of water (332.5) is equivalent to 14x. 
We can find x by dividing 332.5 by 14 to get x = 23.75.
Using the ratio of sugar to water, we find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used as 63x = 63 * 23.75 = 1485.75 teaspoons.
However, this is incorrect because the total number of sugar, water, and milk should be 760. Our initial method of solving the problem was wrong. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem using the correct method.

We know that the total amount of sugar, water, and milk used is 760. We also know that the ratio of sugar to water is 63:14. Let's denote the number of cups of water as 'w'. 
We have (63/14) * w + w + (9/7) * w = 760 

Combining like terms, we get (63/14 + 1) * w + (9/7) * w = 760
Combining the fractions on the left side, we get (77/14) * w + (18/14) * w = 760 
(95/14) * w = 760 
Multiplying both sides by 14, we get 95 * w = 10640 
Dividing both sides by 95, we get w = 112 

Now, we can find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used by multiplying the number of cups of water by the ratio of sugar to water. 
The ratio is 63:14, and the number of cups of water is 112. 
The number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used is (63/14) * 112 = 504

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of each item**

* 12 notebooks at ₣2.75 each: 12 x ₣2.75 = ₣33.00
* 6 rulers at ₣9.0 each: 6 x ₣9.0 = ₣54.00
* 1 bond paper at ₣10: ₣10
* 3 crayons at ₣11 each: 3 x ₣11 = ₣33.00

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of all items**

Add up the costs of all items: ₣33.00 + ₣54.00 + ₣10 + ₣33.00 = ₣130.00

**Step 3: Calculate the 10% discount**

10% of ₣130.00 is: 0.10 x ₣130.00 = ₣13.00

**Step 4: Calculate the final cost after discount**

Subtract the discount from the total cost: ₣130.00 - ₣13.00 = ₣117.00

Therefore, Arjun spent ₣117.00 on everything after receiving a 10% discount on all purchases.",10.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Arjun bought.

1. Notebooks: Arjun bought 12 notebooks at ₣2.75 each.
   So, the total cost of notebooks is 12 * ₣2.75 = ₣33.00.

2. Rulers: Arjun bought 6 rulers at ₣9.0 each.
   So, the total cost of rulers is 6 * ₣9.0 = ₣54.00.

3. Bond paper: Arjun bought 1 rim of bond paper at ₣10.
   So, the total cost of bond paper is ₣10.

4. Crayons: Arjun bought 3 crayons at ₣11 each.
   So, the total cost of crayons is 3 * ₣11 = ₣33.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
Total cost = ₣33.00 + ₣54.00 + ₣10 + ₣33.00 = ₣130.00.

Since Arjun receives a 10% discount on all purchases, we need to calculate the discount amount.
Discount amount = 10% of ₣130.00
= (10/100) * ₣130.00
= ₣13.00.

Now, let's subtract the discount amount from the total cost to get the final amount Arjun spent:
Final amount = Total cost - Discount amount
= ₣130.00 - ₣13.00
= ₣117.00.

The answer is ₣117.00.",117.0,1,,117.0,1

1. If Isabella does her taxes herself, she'll lose ₣82/hour in missed income for 12 fewer hours of consulting work. This means she'll lose a total of:

Q: Isabella is trying to decide whether to do her taxes herself or hire a financial advisor. If she does them herself, she'll be able to do 12 fewer hours of consulting work, losing ₣82/hour in missed income. Additionally, if she does her taxes herself, she'll need to spend 3 hours mailing the completed tax documents, further reducing her consulting time. A financial advisor charges ₣82. How much more money will she have if she hires a financial advisor?

A: Let's think step by step.

If Isabella does her taxes herself, she'll lose ₣82/hour for 12 hours, which is 12 * ₣82 = ₣984. Additionally, she'll spend 3 hours mailing the tax documents, which is 3 * ₣82 = ₣246. So, the total amount of money she'll lose is ₣984 + ₣246 = ₣1230.

If she hires a financial advisor, she won't lose any money from doing her taxes herself. The financial advisor charges ₣82, but this is a one-time fee, and it's not related to the amount of money she'll lose from doing her taxes herself.

So, the amount of money she'll have if she hires a financial advisor is the amount she would have lost if she did her taxes herself, which is ₣1230.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row?,43.75,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 and the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row, and then find the difference between the two probabilities.

**Probability of rolling a number greater than 10:**

There are 10 numbers greater than 10 on a 20-sided die (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20). So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is:

10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5

**Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row:**

The probability of rolling an odd number on a 20-sided die is 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5, since there are 10 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19) out of 20.

To find the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row, we need to multiply the probability of rolling an odd number four times:

(1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/16 = 0.0625

**Difference in probability:**

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities:

0.5 - 0.0625 = 0.4375

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.4375 × 100 = 43.75%

So, Luis is 43.75% more likely to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll four odd numbers in a row.",10.0,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

However, I notice that the problem involves probability, which is a different type of math problem compared to the ones you provided. Nevertheless, I'll break it down into steps.

Q: Luis is rolling a 20-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row?

A: Let's think step by step.

Step 1: Determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 10.
There are 10 numbers greater than 10 on a 20-sided die (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).
So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5.

Step 2: Determine the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row.
The probability of rolling an odd number on a 20-sided die is 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5.
Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row is (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/16 = 0.0625.

Step 3: Calculate the difference in probability.
The difference in probability is 0.5 - 0.0625 = 0.4375.

Step 4: Convert the difference to a percentage.
To convert the difference to a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.4375 × 100 = 43.75%.

We know that there are 64 rabbits, 36 grasshoppers, and 24 ants. We also know that the number of ladybugs is 1/6 the number of ants, so the number of ladybugs is 1/6 * 24 = 4.

The total number of animals is the sum of the number of rabbits, grasshoppers, ants, and ladybugs: 64 + 36 + 24 + 4 = 128.

To find the percentage of animals that were rabbits, we divide the number of rabbits by the total number of animals and multiply by 100: (64 / 128) * 100 = 50.

So, 50% of the animals in the plot were rabbits.",50.0,1,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Liam found 64 rabbits, 36 grasshoppers, and 24 ants. To find the total number of animals, we need to add these numbers together.

Let's think step by step.
Liam found 64 rabbits.
He found 36 grasshoppers.
He found 24 ants.
So, the total number of animals is 64 + 36 + 24 = 124.

Now, we need to find the percentage of animals that were rabbits. To do this, we'll divide the number of rabbits by the total number of animals and multiply by 100.

Let's think step by step.
The total number of animals is 124.
The number of rabbits is 64.
So, the percentage of animals that were rabbits is (64 / 124) * 100.

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4.

Let's think step by step.
The numerator is 64, and the greatest common divisor of 64 and 124 is 4.
So, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 4.

Q: Liam went to their greenhouse to pick some blueberries and found 1/6 as many ladybugs as ants in the plot. Liam then found 64 rabbits, 36 grasshoppers, and 24 ants. What percentage of animals in the plot were rabbits?

A: Let's think step by step.

Liam found 24 ants.
He found 1/6 as many ladybugs as ants, so the number of ladybugs is 24 / 6 = 4.
He also found 64 rabbits and 36 grasshoppers.
So, the total number of animals is 24 + 4 + 64 + 36 = 128.
The number of rabbits is 64.
To find the percentage of rabbits, we need to divide the number of rabbits by the total number of animals and multiply by 100.
So, the percentage of rabbits is (64 / 128) * 100 = 50.0%.

1. Yuki stopped being pen pals with 4 out of 8 people, so he is now pen pals with 8 - 4 = 4 people.

2. Each of his 4 pen pals sends 3 letters a week, and each letter is 10 pages long. So, each pen pal sends 3 x 10 = 30 pages a week.

3. Since Yuki has 4 pen pals, the total number of pages he receives from them each week is 4 x 30 = 120 pages.

4. Yuki responds in kind, so he sends 120 pages back to his pen pals each week.

5. Since Yuki can write 1 page every 14 minutes, he can write 60 / 14 = 4.29 pages per hour (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

6. To find out how many hours Yuki spends writing each week, we need to divide the total number of pages he writes (120) by the number of pages he can write per hour (4.29). 

120 pages / 4.29 pages/hour = 28 hours per week

7. To find out how many hours Yuki spends writing each day, we need to divide the total number of hours he spends writing each week (28 hours) by 7 (the number of days in a week).

28 hours / 7 days = 4 hours per day

Therefore, Yuki spends an average of 4 hours per day writing to his pen pals.",4.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Yuki was a pen pal with 8 people.
He stopped being pen pals with 4 of them.

Since there are 7 days in a week, Yuki receives 3 * 4 = 12 letters a day.

If Ms. Johnson can get 10% discount on the selling price, how much more is the total cost will be than Ms. Johnson's budget?",56500.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The selling price of the property is $500,000.
2. Ms. Johnson can get a 10% discount on the selling price. 
   To find the discounted price, multiply the selling price by 0.10 (10%).
   Discounted price = $500,000 * 0.10
   Discounted price = $50,000
   Selling price after discount = $500,000 - $50,000
   Selling price after discount = $450,000

3. The brokerage fee is 4% of the selling price after the discount.
   Brokerage fee = $450,000 * 0.04
   Brokerage fee = $18,000

   Total cost = $526,500

6. To find out how much more the total cost will be than Ms. Johnson's budget, subtract the budget from the total cost.

The brokerage fee is 4% of the selling price.
So, the brokerage fee is 4% of 500,000 = 0.04 * 500,000 = 20,000.

The transfer fee is 13% of the selling price.
So, the transfer fee is 13% of 500,000 = 0.13 * 500,000 = 65,000.

The total cost is the sum of the discounted price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee.

Therefore, Prof. Johnson's net proceeds from selling the apartment are $228400.",228400.0,0,"To find Prof. Johnson's net proceeds from selling the apartment, we need to calculate the total amount of money spent and subtract it from the selling price.

The selling price of the apartment is $540,000.

The registration fees are 3% of the selling price. To find 3% of $540,000, we multiply 0.03 by $540,000: 
0.03 * 540000 = $16200.

The agent fee is 6% of the selling price. To find 6% of $540,000, we multiply 0.06 by $540,000: 
0.06 * 540000 = $32400.

Prof. Johnson also paid $260,000 for the remaining loan amount and $5,000 for closing costs. To find the total amount spent, we add these values together: 
$260,000 + $32,400 (registration fees) + $32,400 (agent fee) + $5,000 = $329,700.

Q: Prof. Johnson sold his apartment for $540000. He paid the registration fees that amount to 3% of the selling price and also paid the agent fee that is 6% of the selling price. If he also paid $260000 for the remaining loan amount of the apartment, and $5000 for closing costs, how much is Prof. Johnson's net proceeds from selling the apartment?

A: Let's think step by step.

Prof. Johnson sold his apartment for $540000.
The registration fees amount to 3% of the selling price, which is 540000 * 0.03 = 16200.
The agent fee is 6% of the selling price, which is 540000 * 0.06 = 32400.
So, the total amount paid for fees is 16200 + 32400 = 48600.
Prof. Johnson also paid $260000 for the remaining loan amount of the apartment.
He also paid $5000 for closing costs.
So, the total amount paid is 48600 + 260000 + 5000 = 306000.
Prof. Johnson's net proceeds from selling the apartment is the selling price minus the total amount paid: 540000 - 306000 = 234000.

**Step 1: Calculate Mateo's weekly income**

Mateo works 6 hours a day, 3 days a week, so his total hours worked per week is:
6 hours/day × 3 days/week = 18 hours/week

He earns ₣25 per hour, so his weekly income is:
18 hours/week × ₣25/hour = ₣450/week

**Step 2: Add the weekly bonus**

Mateo gets a ₣205 bonus each week if the company performs well. So, his total weekly income is:
₣450/week + ₣205/week = ₣655/week

**Step 3: Calculate Mateo's monthly income**

Mateo also gets a ₣205 bonus each week if the company performs well. Let's calculate his total bonus for the month:

He gets a ₣205 bonus each week.
There are 4 weeks in September.
So, his total bonus for the month is 205 * 4 = ₣820.

Now, let's calculate Mateo's total earnings for the month, including the bonus:

**Step 1: Calculate the initial value of Ananya's shares**

Ananya buys 12 shares of a stock for ¥80 each. The initial value of her shares is:

12 shares × ¥80/share = ¥960

**Step 2: Calculate the stock price after the first year (55% increase)**

The stock price increases by 55% in the first year. To calculate the new stock price, we need to find 55% of the initial stock price and add it to the initial stock price.

Initial stock price = ¥80
Increase = 55% of ¥80 = 0.55 × ¥80 = ¥44
New stock price = ¥80 + ¥44 = ¥124

**Step 3: Calculate the value of Ananya's shares after the first year**

Ananya has 12 shares, and the new stock price is ¥124. The value of her shares after the first year is:

12 shares × ¥124/share = ¥1,488

**Step 4: Calculate the stock price after the second year (25% decrease)**

The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. To calculate the new stock price, we need to find 25% of the stock price after the first year and subtract it from the stock price after the first year.

Stock price after the first year = ¥124
Decrease = 25% of ¥124 = 0.25 × ¥124 = ¥31
New stock price = ¥124 - ¥31 = ¥93

**Step 5: Calculate the value of Ananya's shares after the second year**

12 shares × ¥93/share = ¥1,116

**Step 6: Calculate the stock price after the third year (25% increase)**

The stock price increases by 25% in the third year. To calculate the new stock price, we need to find 25% of the stock price after the second year and add it to the stock price after the second year.

Stock price after the second year = ¥93

New price after the first year = Initial price + Increase in price

The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. To find the new price, we'll calculate 25% of the price after the first year and subtract it from the price after the first year.

Decrease in price = 25% of ¥124
= 0.25 × ¥124
= ¥31

New price after the second year = Price after the first year - Decrease in price
= ¥124 - ¥31
= ¥93

The stock price increases by 25% in the third year. To find the new price, we'll calculate 25% of the price after the second year and add it to the price after the second year.

Increase in price = 25% of ¥93

New price after the third year = Price after the second year + Increase in price
= ¥93 + ¥23.25

Emma's dad budgeted €180 for her birthday party.
Emma wants to spend money on laser tag, pinball tokens, roller coaster rides, and bus rental.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities:

Laser tag: Emma and her friends will play one round each, but we don't know how many friends she's inviting yet. 
So, let's call the number of friends x.
The cost of laser tag will be 6 € * (1 + x).

Pinball tokens: Emma wants €4 each for herself and her friends, so she'll need 4 * (1 + x) €.

Roller coaster rides: Emma and her friends want to ride the roller coaster three times, so the cost will be 10 € * 3 = 30 €.

Bus rental: The bus rental costs €60.

Total cost so far is (6 * (1 + x)) + (4 * (1 + x)) + 30 + 60.

Combine like terms: 
6 * (1 + x) + 4 * (1 + x) = (6 + 4) * (1 + x) = 10 * (1 + x).

Now we can rewrite the total cost: 
10 * (1 + x) + 30 + 60.

Combine constants: 
10 * (1 + x) + 90.

We know that the total budget is €180. 
So, the total cost of Emma's plan should not exceed €180: 
10 * (1 + x) + 90 ≤ 180.

Let's isolate 10 * (1 + x): 
10 * (1 + x) ≤ 180 - 90.
10 * (1 + x) ≤ 90.

Divide both sides by 10: 
1 + x ≤ 9.

Subtract 1 from both sides: 
x ≤ 8.

* Bus rental: €60

Let's calculate the total cost of the activities:
Laser tag: €6 per round (but we don't know how many rounds she'll play, so we'll leave this for now)
Pinball tokens: €4
Roller coaster: €10 per ride (3 rides) = €10 * 3 = €30
Bus rental: €60

The total cost of the activities (excluding laser tag) is €4 + €30 + €60 = €94.

Now, let's subtract this amount from the total budget to find out how much is left for laser tag:
€180 - €94 = €86

Since a round of laser tag costs €6, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost of a round of laser tag to find out how many rounds Emma can afford:

**Step 1: Calculate the total calories from the soda**

Diego drinks 3 bottles of soda, each with 7 mL of soda. The soda has 6 calories per mL, so we multiply the volume of soda (7 mL) by the calories per mL (6):

7 mL x 6 calories/mL = 42 calories per bottle

Since Diego drinks 3 bottles, we multiply the calories per bottle by 3:

42 calories/bottle x 3 bottles = 126 calories from the soda

Therefore, Diego consumed a total of 180 calories.",180.0,1,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Q: A bottle of soda is 7 mL of soda. Diego drinks 3 bottles of soda and adds 3 teaspoons of sugar to each bottle. Each teaspoon of sugar adds 6 calories. If the soda has 6 calories per mL how many calories did he consume?

A: Let's think step by step.
First, let's calculate the total amount of soda Diego drinks.
Each bottle is 7 mL, and he drinks 3 bottles.
So, the total amount of soda is 7 * 3 = 21 mL.
Since the soda has 6 calories per mL, the total calories from the soda are 21 * 6 = 126 calories.

Next, let's calculate the total calories from the sugar.
Each teaspoon of sugar adds 6 calories, and he adds 3 teaspoons to each bottle.
So, the total calories from the sugar in each bottle are 3 * 6 = 18 calories.
Since he drinks 3 bottles, the total calories from the sugar are 18 * 3 = 54 calories.

Now, let's add the calories from the soda and the sugar to get the total calories consumed.
The total calories consumed are 126 + 54 = 180 calories.

How much does he earn in a year after paying 25% in taxes?,1296.0,"To find out how much the carpenter earns in a year, we need to calculate his daily earnings, weekly earnings, monthly earnings, and then annual earnings.

**Step 1: Calculate daily earnings**
The carpenter gets paid ¥12 every day.

**Step 2: Calculate weekly earnings**
He works 6 days every week, so his weekly earnings are:
6 days/week × ¥12/day = ¥72/week

**Step 3: Calculate monthly earnings**
He works for 2 weeks every month, so his monthly earnings are:
2 weeks/month × ¥72/week = ¥144/month

**Step 4: Calculate annual earnings**
There are 12 months in a year, so his annual earnings are:
12 months/year × ¥144/month = ¥1728/year

**Step 5: Calculate taxes**
The carpenter pays 25% in taxes, so the amount of taxes he pays is:
25% × ¥1728 = ¥432

**Step 6: Calculate take-home pay**
The carpenter's take-home pay is his annual earnings minus the taxes he pays:
¥1728 - ¥432 = ¥1296

Therefore, the carpenter earns ¥1296 in a year after paying 25% in taxes.",25.0,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

The carpenter works 2 weeks every month, and there are 4 weeks in a month. So, the total number of days he works in a month is 2 * 4 = 8 days.

He also works 6 days every week, but we already know he works 8 days in a month, so we don't need to add the extra days.

The carpenter gets paid ¥12 every day, so his monthly income is 8 * ¥12 = ¥96.

There are 12 months in a year, so his annual income is 12 * ¥96 = ¥1152.

Now, let's calculate the taxes. The carpenter pays 25% of his income in taxes, which is 0.25 * ¥1152 = ¥288.

To find his take-home pay, we subtract the taxes from his annual income: ¥1152 - ¥288 = ¥864.

Q: A carpenter works for 2 weeks every month and 6 days every week. He gets paid ¥12 every day. How much does he earn in a year after paying 25% in taxes?

A: Let's think step by step.

The carpenter works for 2 weeks every month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, he works for 2 * 4 = 8 weeks every month.

He works 6 days every week, so the total number of days he works every month is 8 weeks * 6 days/week = 48 days.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of days he works in a year is 48 days/month * 12 months = 576 days.

He gets paid ¥12 every day, so his total earnings in a year are 576 days * ¥12/day = ¥6912.

However, he has to pay 25% in taxes. To find the amount of taxes, we multiply his total earnings by 25% (or 0.25): ¥6912 * 0.25 = ¥1728.

To find his take-home pay, we subtract the taxes from his total earnings: ¥6912 - ¥1728 = ¥5184.

How many pineapples and kiwis does Theo have in the house combined?",349.0,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 25 kiwis. Since there are 8 times as many pineapples as kiwis, there are 8 * 25 = 200 pineapples.

Theo then bought 63 more kiwis, so he has 25 + 63 = 88 kiwis.

He bought 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis, so the number of pineapples is 88 - 19 = 69.

After buying 13 pineapples, he has 69 + 13 = 82 pineapples.

He bought 22 fewer than two times as many kiwis. Two times as many kiwis is 2 * 88 = 176. 22 fewer than that is 176 - 22 = 154. So, he bought 154 more kiwis.

Now, the total number of kiwis is 88 + 154 = 242.

The total number of pineapples and kiwis combined is 82 (pineapples) + 242 (kiwis) = 324.",324.0,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the initial number of pineapples and kiwis. We know that there are eight times as many pineapples as kiwis, and there are 25 kiwis.

So, the initial number of pineapples is 8 * 25 = 200.

Now, let's consider the changes that Theo made:

1. He bought 63 more kiwis, so the new total of kiwis is 25 + 63 = 88.
2. He bought 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis, which is 88 - 19 = 69 pineapples.
3. He bought 13 pineapples, so the new total of pineapples is 200 + 13 - 19 = 194.
4. He bought 22 fewer than two times as many kiwis, which is 2 * 88 - 22 = 154 kiwis.
5. However, we already know that he bought 63 more kiwis, so the new total of kiwis is 88 + 154 - 63 = 179.

Now, let's combine the new totals of pineapples and kiwis:

The total number of pineapples is 194.
The total number of kiwis is 179.

How many pineapples and kiwis does Theo have in the house combined?

A: Let's think step by step.

Step 1: Theo starts with 25 kiwis.
He buys 63 more kiwis.
So, the total number of kiwis is 25 + 63 = 88.

Step 2: There are eight times as many pineapples as kiwis initially. 
So, the initial number of pineapples is 25 * 8 = 200.

Step 3: Theo then buys 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis.
He initially had 200 pineapples, so he bought 88 - 19 = 69 fewer pineapples.
So, he bought 200 - 69 = 131 pineapples.

Step 4: Theo bought 13 more pineapples.
So, the total number of pineapples is 131 + 13 = 144.

Step 5: Theo then bought 22 fewer than two times as many kiwis. 
He has 88 kiwis, so two times that number is 2 * 88 = 176.
He bought 22 fewer kiwis, so he bought 176 - 22 = 154 kiwis.

Step 6: Theo bought 154 more kiwis.
So, the total number of kiwis is 88 + 154 = 242.

How much money does Ananya have left?",361.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the saltwater taffy**

Ananya bought 23 kgs of saltwater taffy. The first 16 kgs are at $23 per kg, so the cost of the first 16 kgs is:

16 kgs x $23/kg = $368

The next 4 kgs are 1/2 off, so the cost of the 4 kgs is:

4 kgs x $23/kg x 0.5 = $46

The total cost of the saltwater taffy is:

$368 + $46 = $414

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the starfish and keychains**

Ananya bought a mixed bag of starfish for $11.0 and 17 keychains for $20.0 each. The total cost of the keychains is:

17 keychains x $20/keychain = $340

The total cost of the starfish and keychains is:

$11.0 + $340 = $351

Ananya started with $1200. After buying the items, she has:

$1200 - $765 = $435

Ananya starts with $1200.

She buys 16 kgs of saltwater taffy at $23 per kg, which costs 16 * $23 = $368.
The 4 kgs 1/2 off means that the price of these 4 kgs is 4/2 = 2 kgs at full price and the other 2 kgs at half price. 
So, the 2 kgs at full price costs 2 * $23 = $46, and the 2 kgs at half price costs 2 * (1/2 * $23) = $23.
The total cost of the saltwater taffy is $368 + $46 + $23 = $437.

She also buys a mixed bag of starfish for $11.

She buys 17 keychains at $20 each, which costs 17 * $20 = $340.

The total amount she spent is $437 + $11 + $340 = $788.

A: Let's think step by step.

Step 1: Ananya starts with $1200.

Step 2: The sale has two different prices: $23 per kg for the first 16 kgs and 1/2 off for the next 4 kgs.  Since 23 kg is more than 16 kg, Ananya can get the discount on 7 kg (23 - 16 = 7) and the regular price on 16 kg. The cost for the first 16 kg is 16 * $23 = $368. The cost for the 7 kg is 7/2 * $23 = $80.50. So, the total cost of the saltwater taffy is $368 + $80.50 = $448.50.

Step 3: Ananya bought a mixed bag of starfish for $11.0.

Step 4: She bought 17 keychains at $20.0 each. The total cost of the keychains is 17 * $20 = $340.

1. Theo slew 450 giants.
2. Jamal slew three-fifths as many giants as Theo. To find the number of giants Jamal slew, we multiply 450 by 3/5:

Jamal slew three-fifths as many giants as Theo.
Three-fifths of 450 is (3/5) * 450 = 270.
So, Jamal slew 270 giants.

First, let's find out how much money Andre had left after buying the items.

Andre had 100 dollars and 3% of it was left in change.

To find 3% of 100, multiply 0.03 by 100.
0.03 * 100 = 3

So, Andre had 3 dollars left in change.

Now, let's find the cost of the items Andre bought. 
He bought 4 bags of crackers at 75 cents each and 7 packs of pretzels at 7 dollars each. 

Cost of crackers: 4 * 0.75 = 3 dollars
Cost of pretzels: 7 * 7 = 49 dollars

The total cost of crackers and pretzels: 3 + 49 = 52 dollars

Now, let's subtract the total cost of crackers and pretzels from the amount of money Andre had initially.
He had 100 dollars initially, and he had 3 dollars left in change. So, he spent 100 - 3 = 97 dollars.

Since the total cost of crackers and pretzels was 52 dollars, and the total amount spent was 97 dollars, the amount spent on gum would be:

If the length of his room is 16 feet longer that its width, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?",68.0,"To solve this problem, we need to first find the width and length of the room. Let's call the width ""w"" and the length ""l"". We know that the area of the room is 225 square feet, so we can write an equation:

w × l = 225

We also know that the length of the room is 16 feet longer than its width, so we can write another equation:

l = w + 16

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

w × (w + 16) = 225

Expanding the equation, we get:

w^2 + 16w = 225

Rearranging the equation to form a quadratic equation, we get:

w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0

Now we can factor the quadratic equation:

(w + 25)(w - 9) = 0

This gives us two possible values for w: w = -25 (which is not possible since the width cannot be negative) or w = 9.

So, the width of the room is 9 feet. Now we can find the length of the room by substituting w = 9 into the equation l = w + 16:

l = 9 + 16
l = 25

Now that we have the width and length of the room, we can find the perimeter by using the formula:

Q: The area of Kai's rectangular office is 225 square feet. If the length of his room is 16 feet longer than its width, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?

A: Let's think step by step.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width.

We are given that the area of Kai's office is 225 square feet. Let's denote the width as W and the length as L. We are also given that the length is 16 feet longer than the width, so we can write an equation: L = W + 16.

We can now substitute the expression for L into the area formula: 225 = W × (W + 16).

Expanding the equation, we get: 225 = W² + 16W.

Rearranging the equation to form a quadratic equation, we get: W² + 16W - 225 = 0.

To solve for W, we can use the quadratic formula: W = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 1, b = 16, and c = -225.

Plugging in the values, we get: W = (-16 ± √(16² - 4(1)(-225))) / 2(1).

Simplifying the equation, we get: W = (-16 ± √(256 + 900)) / 2.

W = (-16 ± √1156) / 2.

W = (-16 ± 34) / 2.

We have two possible solutions for W: W = (-16 + 34) / 2 or W = (-16 - 34) / 2.

Simplifying the first solution, we get: W = 18 / 2 = 9.

Simplifying the second solution, we get: W = -50 / 2 = -25. Since the width cannot be negative, we discard this solution.

So, the width of the room is 9 feet.

Now that we have the width, we can find the length using the equation: L = W + 16.

L = 9 + 16 = 25.

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width).

Perimeter = 2(25 + 9).

Perimeter = 2(34).

Perimeter = 68.

On average, how many cards per color are there?",54.0,"To find the average number of cards per color, we need to find the total number of cards of each color and then divide by the number of colors. 

First, let's find the number of red cards. Since there are 70% more red cards than pink cards:
70% of 30 = 0.7 * 30 = 21
So, there are 70 more red cards than pink cards.
Number of red cards = 30 + 70 = 100

Now, we find the total number of pink and red cards:
Total of pink and red cards = 30 + 100 = 130

We are given that purple cards are as many as the sum of pink and red cards, so the number of purple cards is also 130.

We have the total number of cards for each color:
- Pink: 30
- Red: 100
- Purple: 130

The total number of cards is the sum of these:
Total cards = 30 + 100 + 130 = 260

Now, we divide the total number of cards by 3 to get the average number of cards per color:
Average number of cards per color = Total cards / 3
= 260 / 3

So, the number of red cards is 30 + 21 = 51.
Purple cards are as many as the sum of pink and red cards.
The number of purple cards is 30 + 51 = 81.
In total, there are 30 + 51 + 81 = 162 cards.

Olivia has 148 puppies
Gabriel has 62 puppies
Total puppies from Olivia and Gabriel = 148 + 62 = 210

Now, let's add the puppies from Santiago:

So, approximately 79.88% of all the puppies have spots.",79.88,0,"Let's think step by step.

We need to find the total number of puppies with spots and the total number of puppies, then calculate the percentage of puppies with spots.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of puppies with spots from Olivia's and Gabriel's dogs.
Olivia's dog has 28 puppies with spots.
Gabriel's dog has 16 puppies with spots.
So, the total number of puppies with spots from these two dogs is 28 + 16 = 44.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of puppies from Olivia's and Gabriel's dogs.
Olivia's dog has 148 puppies.
Gabriel's dog has 62 puppies.
So, the total number of puppies from these two dogs is 148 + 62 = 210.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of puppies with spots from Santiago's dogs.
Santiago has 62 dogs, and each has 10 puppies with spots.
So, the total number of puppies with spots from Santiago's dogs is 62 * 10 = 620.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of puppies with spots.
We already know the total number of puppies with spots from Olivia's and Gabriel's dogs (44).
We also know the total number of puppies with spots from Santiago's dogs (620).
So, the total number of puppies with spots is 44 + 620 = 664.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of puppies.
We already know the total number of puppies from Olivia's and Gabriel's dogs (210).
We know the total number of puppies from Santiago's dogs is 62 * 62 = 3842.
So, the total number of puppies is 210 + 3842 = 4052.

Step 6: Calculate the percentage of puppies with spots.
We have the total number of puppies (4052) and the total number of puppies with spots (664).
So, the percentage of puppies with spots is (664 / 4052) * 100 ≈ 16.36%.

First, let's find the total number of puppies.
Olivia's dog has 148 puppies.
Gabriel's dog has 62 puppies.
Santiago has 62 dogs, each having 10 puppies, so he has 62 * 10 = 620 puppies.

- Carrots: 11 * 9 kg = 99 kg
- Apples: 33 * 43 kg = 1419 kg
- Wheat: 18 * 19 kg = 342 kg
- Grocery: 43 kg

4. Multiply the result by the number of trucks:
15 trips * 3 trucks = 45 trips

However, the answer will actually be the division of the total weight by the capacity of one truck, as this is the minimum number of trips. So the correct answer will be the division of the total weight by the capacity of one truck.

The farmer buys:
- 4 boxes of corns, each 5 kg, so the total weight of corns is 4 * 5 = 20 kg.
- 11 bags of carrots, each 9 kg, so the total weight of carrots is 11 * 9 = 99 kg.
- 33 packs of apples, each 43 kg, so the total weight of apples is 33 * 43 = 1413 kg.
- 18 sacks of wheat, each 19 kg, so the total weight of wheat is 18 * 19 = 342 kg.
- 43 kg of grocery.
- 27 kg of tools.

The total weight of all items is 20 + 99 + 1413 + 342 + 43 + 27 = 1944 kg.

The farm truck can carry 130 kg at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity: 1944 / 130 = 15.

However, the farmer has three trucks. To find out how many trips are needed with three trucks, we divide the total weight by the combined capacity of the three trucks: 1944 / (130 * 3) = 1944 / 390 = 5.

Since the farmer has three trucks, he can make 5 trips with each truck, but he will have some capacity left on the last trip. To find out how many trips he needs to make, we divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck and round up to the nearest whole number: 1944 / 130 = 15.027 (round up to 16).

However, since the farmer has three trucks, he can make 5 trips with each truck, and then make one more trip with the remaining capacity. So, the farmer needs to make 5 trips with each truck, and then make one more trip with the remaining capacity.

How many trips does the farmer need to transport all the items, if he has three trucks?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's find the total weight of the items to be transported.
The total weight of corns is 4 * 5 kg = 20 kg.
The total weight of carrots is 11 * 9 kg = 99 kg.
The total weight of apples is 33 * 43 kg = 1419 kg.
The total weight of wheat is 18 * 19 kg = 342 kg.
The total weight of grocery and tools is 43 kg + 27 kg = 70 kg.
So, the total weight of the items is 20 + 99 + 1419 + 342 + 70 = 1850 kg.

Since the farmer has three trucks, we need to divide the total weight by 130 kg (the capacity of one truck).
The total weight is 1850 kg.
The capacity of one truck is 130 kg.
So, the number of trips needed for one truck is 1850 / 130 = 14.23 trips.

Since we can't have a fraction of a trip, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.
The number of trips for one truck is 15.

Since the farmer has three trucks, we divide the number of trips for one truck by 3.
The number of trips for one truck is 15.
The farmer has 3 trucks.
So, the total number of trips is 15 / 3 = 5.

However, this is not the correct answer, as the previous solution I provided was incorrect.
Let's reconsider the problem.
The total weight of the items is 1850 kg.
The capacity of one truck is 130 kg.
So, the number of trips needed for one truck is 1850 / 130 = 14.23 trips.

However, the farmer has three trucks, and the total weight is 1850 kg.
If we use one truck, we need 15 trips.
If we use two trucks, we need (1850 / (130 * 2)) * 2 = 7.69 trips * 2 = 15.38 trips.
We still need more than 15 trips.

If we use three trucks, we need (1850 / (130 * 3)) * 3 = 4.46 trips * 3 = 13.38 trips.

We still need more than 13 trips with three trucks, but we can't use a fraction of a trip.
So, we need 14 trips with three trucks.

After using all her sprinkles to bake cupcakes and putting them in pans, how many empty pans will Leilani be left with?",1.0,"To find the number of empty pans Leilani will be left with, we need to first find out how many cupcakes she can bake with her sprinkles, and then divide that number by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold.

Step 1: Find out how many cupcakes Leilani can bake with her sprinkles.
Leilani has 4 jars of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate 16 cupcakes. So, the total number of cupcakes she can bake is:
4 jars x 16 cupcakes/jar = 64 cupcakes

Step 2: Find out how many cupcakes Leilani can bake with her sprinkles and put them in pans.
Leilani has 9 pans, each can hold 8 cupcakes. So, the total number of cupcakes she can bake and put in pans is:
9 pans x 8 cupcakes/pan = 72 cupcakes

However, we know that Leilani can only bake 64 cupcakes with her sprinkles. So, we will use 64 cupcakes instead of 72 cupcakes.

Step 3: Find out how many empty pans Leilani will be left with.
Leilani has 9 pans, and she can put 8 cupcakes in each pan. Since she can bake 64 cupcakes, we need to divide 64 by 8 to find out how many pans she will fill:
64 cupcakes ÷ 8 cupcakes/pan = 8 pans

Since Leilani has 9 pans and she will fill 8 pans, she will be left with:
9 pans - 8 pans = 1 empty pan

Therefore, Leilani will be left with 1 empty pan.",1.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Leilani has 4 jars of sprinkles.
Each jar can decorate 16 cupcakes.
So, the total number of cupcakes that can be decorated is 4 * 16 = 64.

Leilani has 9 pans, each can hold 8 cupcakes.
So, the total number of cupcakes that can be held in the pans is 9 * 8 = 72.

Since Leilani can only decorate 64 cupcakes with her sprinkles, she will not be able to fill all the pans.

To find out how many empty pans she will be left with, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes she can decorate from the total number of cupcakes that can be held in the pans.

The number of empty pans is 72 - 64 = 8.

Q: A farmer is buying feed for his alpacas. He buys a variety of apples, wheat, carrots and corns. Since corns are a rare treat, he only buys four 5-kg boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the alpacas while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys eleven 9-kg bags. Apples are the main diet of his alpacas, so he buys thirty three 43-kg packs. Wheat are a staple to supplement the apples, so he buys eighteen 19-kg sacks. Finally, he buys 43 kgs of grocery, and 27 kgs of tools. A farm truck can carry 130 kgs at a time. How many trips does the farmer need to transport all the items, if he has three trucks?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's find the total weight of the items to be transported.
The total weight of corns is 4 * 5 kg = 20 kg.
The total weight of carrots is 11 * 9 kg = 99 kg.
The total weight of apples is 33 * 43 kg = 1419 kg.
The total weight of wheat is 18 * 19 kg = 342 kg.
The total weight of grocery and tools is 43 kg + 27 kg = 70 kg.
So, the total weight of the items is 20 + 99 + 1419 + 342 + 70 = 1850 kg.

Since the farmer has three trucks, we need to divide the total weight by 130 kg (the capacity of one truck).
The total weight is 1850 kg.
The capacity of one truck is 130 kg.
So, the number of trips needed for one truck is 1850 / 130 = 14.23 trips.

However, we can't have a fraction of a trip, so we need to consider the number of trips needed for three trucks.
If we use one truck, we need 15 trips.
If we use two trucks, we need (1850 / (130 * 2)) * 2 = 7.69 trips * 2 = 15.38 trips.
We still need more than 15 trips.

If we use three trucks, we need (1850 / (130 * 3)) * 3 = 4.46 trips * 3 = 13.38 trips.

We still need more than 13 trips with three trucks, but we can't use a fraction of a trip.
So, we need to consider the total weight and the capacity of the trucks.
The total weight is 1850 kg.
The capacity of three trucks is 130 * 3 = 390 kg.
So, the number of trips needed for three trucks is 1850 / 390 = 4.74 trips.

However, we can't have a fraction of a trip, so we need to round up to the nearest whole number.
The number of trips needed for three trucks is 5.

However, this is not the correct answer, as we need to consider the total weight and the capacity of the trucks.
Let's reconsider the problem.
The total weight of the items is 1850 kg.
The capacity of three trucks is 390 kg.
So, the number of trips needed for three trucks is 1850 / 390 = 4.74 trips.

We can't have a fraction of a trip, so we need to round up to the nearest whole number.
However, we need to consider the fact that we can't have a fraction of a trip, but we also can't have a whole number of trips that is less than the actual number of trips needed.

What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remaining remoras?,20.0,"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that is the combined length of the remaining remoras, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the total length of the remoras that are attached to the shark.
2. Calculate the number of remoras that remain after 1/5 of them go away.
3. Find the combined length of the remaining remoras.
4. Divide the combined length of the remaining remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

Step 1: Find the total length of the remoras that are attached to the shark.

There are 15 remoras, each 15 inches long. So, the total length of the remoras is:
15 remoras * 15 inches/remora = 225 inches

Step 2: Calculate the number of remoras that remain after 1/5 of them go away.

1/5 of the remoras go away, so the number of remoras that remain is:
15 remoras - (1/5 * 15 remoras) = 15 remoras - 3 remoras = 12 remoras

Step 3: Find the combined length of the remaining remoras.

The remaining remoras are 12 in number, each 15 inches long. So, the combined length of the remaining remoras is:
12 remoras * 15 inches/remora = 180 inches

Step 4: Divide the combined length of the remaining remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

The length of the shark is 75 feet, which is equal to 900 inches. So, the percentage of the shark's body length that is the combined length of the remaining remoras is:
(180 inches / 900 inches) * 100 = 20%

Therefore, the combined length of the remaining remoras is 20% of the shark's body length.",20.0,1,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Q: Ali saw a 75-foot shark with 15 15-inch remoras attached to it. But 1/5 of the remoras go away. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remaining remoras?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the total length of all the remoras.
There are 15 remoras, each 15 inches long.
So, the total length of all the remoras is 15 * 15 = 225 inches.

Since 1/5 of the remoras go away, we need to find 4/5 of the total length of the remoras.
4/5 of 225 inches is (4/5) * 225 = 180 inches.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remaining remoras represents.
The shark is 75 feet long, which is equal to 75 * 12 = 900 inches.

How many tubes of paint does Andre have?",96.0,"Let's break the problem down step by step.

1. Sanjay has 10 tubes of pink paint and 3 tubes of blue paint.

2. Yuki has 2/4 as many tubes of pink paint as Sanjay. To find this, we first find the fraction 2/4 which is equal to 1/2. So Yuki has 1/2 of the number of pink tubes that Sanjay has.
   1/2 * 10 = 5 tubes of pink paint.
   And since Yuki has thrice as many tubes of blue paint as Sanjay, 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of blue paint.

3. Andre has six times as many tubes of black paint as the combined number of pink tubes that Sanjay and Yuki have.
   Combined pink tubes of Sanjay and Yuki = 10 + 5 = 15
   So, 6 * 15 = 90 tubes of black paint.

4. Andre has 6 fewer tubes of white paint than the combined number of blue tubes that Sanjay and Yuki have.
   Combined blue tubes of Sanjay and Yuki = 3 + 9 = 12
   So, 12 - 6 = 6 tubes of white paint.

Since the question asks how many tubes of paint Andre has, we need to add the number of black and white paint tubes Andre has.
90 (black) + 6 (white) = 96

Sanjay has 10 tubes of pink paint and 3 tubes of blue paint.

Yuki has 2/4 as many tubes of pink paint as Sanjay. 
2/4 is the same as 1/2, so Yuki has 1/2 of the pink paint that Sanjay has.
Since Sanjay has 10 tubes of pink paint, Yuki has 1/2 * 10 = 5 tubes of pink paint.
Yuki has thrice as many tubes of blue paint as Sanjay.
So, Yuki has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of blue paint.

The combined number of pink paint that Sanjay and Yuki have is 10 + 5 = 15.
The combined number of blue paint that Sanjay and Yuki have is 3 + 9 = 12.

Andre has 6 times as many tubes of black paint as the combined number of pink tubes that Sanjay and Yuki have.
So, Andre has 6 * 15 = 90 tubes of black paint.
Andre has 6 fewer tubes of white paint than the combined number of blue tubes that Sanjay and Yuki have.

Total crackers initially = 615

Crackers left after eating a third = (615 / 3) = 205

Now, we need to find the total capacity of the bowls and plates.

Each bowl can hold 21 crackers, and Deshawn has 11 bowls. So, total capacity of bowls = 21 * 11 = 231

Each plate can hold twice the capacity of a bowl, so each plate can hold 21 * 2 = 42 crackers. 
Deshawn has 4 plates, so total capacity of plates = 42 * 4 = 168

Total capacity of bowls and plates = 231 + 168 = 399

Deshawn has 11 bowls, so the total number of crackers that can be placed on the bowls is 11 * 21 = 231.

Deshawn has 4 plates, so the total number of crackers that can be placed on the plates is 4 * 42 = 168.

So, the total number of crackers that can be placed on the bowls and plates is 231 + 168 = 399.

1. Find out how long Carlos takes to swim a kilometer on a warm day. 
   Since he swims a kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times as long as on a cold day:
   Time on a cold day = 11 minutes
   Time on a warm day = 4 * 11 minutes + 9 minutes
   Time on a warm day = 44 minutes + 9 minutes
   Time on a warm day = 53 minutes

2. Find out how long Carlos takes to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day.
   Since he swims 1 kilometer in 53 minutes, to find the time for 7 kilometers:

Q: When the water is cold, Carlos swims a kilometer in 11 minutes. When the water is warm, Carlos swims a kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times as long. How much longer does Carlos take to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day than 9 kilometers on a cold day?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Carlos to swim a kilometer on a warm day. We are told that it takes him 9 minutes more than four times as long as it takes him to swim a kilometer on a cold day. Since it takes him 11 minutes to swim a kilometer on a cold day, four times that is 4 * 11 = 44 minutes. Adding 9 minutes to that makes it 44 + 9 = 53 minutes to swim a kilometer on a warm day.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Carlos to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day. Since it takes him 53 minutes to swim a kilometer on a warm day, we multiply that by 7 to get 53 * 7 = 371 minutes.

Then, we need to find out how long it takes Carlos to swim 9 kilometers on a cold day. Since it takes him 11 minutes to swim a kilometer on a cold day, we multiply that by 9 to get 11 * 9 = 99 minutes.

Finally, we need to find out how much longer it takes Carlos to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day than 9 kilometers on a cold day. We subtract the time it takes to swim 9 kilometers on a cold day from the time it takes to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day: 371 - 99 = 272 minutes.

Let's start with the total number of people who apply for the job, which is 160.

First, we need to find out how many people receive interviews. Since 45% of the applicants receive interviews, we can calculate this as follows:

45% of 160 = 0.45 * 160 = 72 people receive interviews.

Next, we need to find out how many people receive a job offer. Since 25% of those who receive interviews receive a job offer, we can calculate this as follows:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of green spools**

Emma has 17 light green spools and 27 dark green spools, so the total number of green spools is:
17 (light green) + 27 (dark green) = 44

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of black spools**

Emma has 49 light black spools and 17 dark black spools, so the total number of black spools is:
49 (light black) + 17 (dark black) = 66

If he makes 8 giant cubes, 24 small cubes, 15 medium cubes, and eight tiny cubes, how many grams of water does he have left?",76.0,"To find out how many grams of water Oliver has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used to make each type of cube and then subtract that from the total amount of water he started with.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of water used for giant cubes**

Number of giant cubes = 8
Water used per giant cube = 12 grams
Total water used for giant cubes = 8 x 12 = 96 grams

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water used for small cubes**

Number of small cubes = 24
Water used per small cube = 1/4 gram = 0.25 grams
Total water used for small cubes = 24 x 0.25 = 6 grams

**Step 3: Calculate the amount of water used for medium cubes**

Number of medium cubes = 15
Water used per medium cube = 11 grams
Total water used for medium cubes = 15 x 11 = 165 grams

**Step 4: Calculate the amount of water used for tiny cubes**

Number of tiny cubes = 8
Since tiny cubes are half the size of small cubes, water used per tiny cube = 0.25 / 2 = 0.125 grams
Total water used for tiny cubes = 8 x 0.125 = 1 gram

**Step 5: Calculate the total amount of water used**

Total water used = Water used for giant cubes + Water used for small cubes + Water used for medium cubes + Water used for tiny cubes
Total water used = 96 + 6 + 165 + 1 = 268 grams

**Step 6: Calculate the amount of water left**

Total water initially = 344 grams

Now, let's add up the total number of portions they can eat per day:

3 (Wei) + 9 (DeShawn) + 18 (Roya) = 30 portions per day

Since the cake has 120 portions, we can divide the total number of portions by the number of portions they can eat per day to find out how many days the cake will last:

120 portions ÷ 30 portions per day = 4 days

Therefore, the cake will last for 4 days.",4.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Wei can eat 3 portions a day.
DeShawn can eat three times as much as Wei, so DeShawn can eat 3 * 3 = 9 portions a day.
Roya can eat twice as much as DeShawn, so Roya can eat 9 * 2 = 18 portions a day.

The total number of portions eaten per day is 3 + 9 + 18 = 30 portions.

The cake has 120 portions in total.
So, the number of days the cake will last is 120 / 30 = 4 days.

First, we need to find the total number of blocks and stuffed animals combined.
The total number of blocks and stuffed animals is 31 + 6 = 37.

1. Each goat needs 9 kilograms of grain.
2. Each alpaca needs 3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs. Let's calculate the amount each alpaca needs:
   Twice the amount each goat needs: 2 x 9 = 18 kilograms
   3 kilograms less than that: 18 - 3 = 15 kilograms
3. Each cow eats as much as a goat and an alpaca eat combined. Let's calculate the amount each cow needs:

Alejandro has 21 goats, 7 alpacas, and 21 cows.

First, we need to find out how much grain each type of animal eats.

1. Each goat needs 9 kilograms of grain.
2. Each alpaca needs 3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs. 
   The amount each goat needs is 9 kg. Twice that amount is 9 * 2 = 18 kg. 
   So, 3 kilograms less than that is 18 - 3 = 15 kg.

Due to the flu season, 35 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.",50.0,"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of occupied beds:
   The hospital has 1/8 of its beds occupied. To find the number of occupied beds, we multiply the total capacity by 1/8:
   Occupied beds = 800 * (1/8) = 800 * 0.125 = 100

2. Calculate the number of beds out of service:
   One-fifth of all the beds are out of service. To find the number of beds out of service, we multiply the total capacity by 1/5:
   Beds out of service = 800 * (1/5) = 800 * 0.2 = 160

3. Calculate the total number of occupied and out-of-service beds:
   Total occupied and out-of-service beds = Occupied beds + Beds out of service
   Total occupied and out-of-service beds = 100 + 160
   Total occupied and out-of-service beds = 260

4. Calculate the number of unoccupied beds:
   Total unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Total occupied and out-of-service beds

   Number of patients admitted in 2 weeks = 35 * 14
   Number of patients admitted in 2 weeks = 490

   Total unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = Total unoccupied beds - Number of patients admitted in 2 weeks
   Total unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = 540 - 490
   Total unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = 50

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 50.",50.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The hospital has a capacity of 800 beds.
1/8 of the beds are occupied, which is (1/8) * 800 = 100 beds.
So, the number of occupied beds is 100.

One-fifth of the beds are out of service, which is (1/5) * 800 = 160 beds.
So, the number of beds out of service is 160.

The number of unoccupied beds initially is the total capacity minus the occupied and out-of-service beds.
The number of unoccupied beds is 800 - 100 - 160 = 540.

The hospital admits 35 patients each day due to the flu season.
Since we want to know the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks, let's first calculate the number of days in 2 weeks.
There are 7 days in a week, so there are 2 * 7 = 14 days in 2 weeks.

In 14 days, the hospital will admit 14 * 35 = 490 patients.
However, we don't know if these patients will be occupying the beds that were initially out of service or the occupied beds.

Let's assume that the 490 patients will occupy the beds that were initially out of service. In that case, the number of beds out of service will be 160 (initial) + 490 (new patients) = 650 beds.

The number of occupied beds will be 100 (initial occupied) + 490 (new patients) = 590 beds.

The number of unoccupied beds in the hospital will be the total capacity minus the occupied and out-of-service beds.
The number of unoccupied beds is 800 - 590 (occupied) - 650 (out-of-service) = -440.
However, a negative number of beds is not possible.

Let's assume that the 490 patients will occupy the beds that were initially occupied, and the beds out of service will remain the same.

The number of occupied beds will be 100 (initial occupied) = 590 (occupied) - 490 (new patients) = 100 beds.

The number of unoccupied beds will be the total capacity minus the occupied and out-of-service beds.
The number of unoccupied beds is 800 - 100 (occupied) - 160 (out-of-service) = 540.

However, since we can't change the number of beds out of service, let's find a more accurate way to solve the problem.

Let's calculate the number of beds that will remain unoccupied and out of service after 2 weeks.
We already calculated that the number of beds out of service is 160.
These beds will remain out of service.

The number of unoccupied beds initially is 540.
However, 490 patients will be admitted due to the flu season.
Since we can't know for sure, let's make an assumption. Let's assume that the hospital will use the beds that are out of service, and the number of occupied beds will be the same, 590.

The number of unoccupied beds will be the total capacity minus the occupied and out-of-service beds.
However, we have to consider the number of beds that will remain out of service after the patients are admitted.
Since 160 beds are out of service, and 490 patients are admitted, 490 - 160 = 330 beds will be taken from the occupied beds.

So, the number of occupied beds will be 590 - 330 = 260.
The number of unoccupied beds is 800 - 260 (occupied) - 160 (out-of-service) = 380.

However, this is a more complex problem than you initially stated. In this case, the number of unoccupied beds will be different based on the number of beds out of service vs occupied beds.

To find the most accurate answer, we need more information about how the hospital will distribute the admitted patients among the occupied and out-of-service beds.

However, since the question doesn't provide this information, we can only make an assumption to get a rough estimate.

Let's assume that 490 patients will occupy the beds that were initially occupied, and the 160 beds that were out of service will remain the same.

The answer is 380.",380.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

The hospital has a total capacity of 800 beds. 
1/8 of the beds are occupied, which is 800 * (1/8) = 100 beds.
So, the number of occupied beds is 100.

1/5 of the beds are out of service, which is 800 * (1/5) = 160 beds.
So, the number of out-of-service beds is 160.

The total number of unoccupied beds is the difference between the total capacity and the occupied and out-of-service beds.
However, we have to consider the occupied beds and out-of-service beds together since we can't count the occupied beds as available beds.
Let's find the total occupied and out-of-service beds first. 
The number of occupied and out-of-service beds is 100 + 160 = 260.
So, the total number of unoccupied beds would be 800 - 260 = 540.

The hospital admits 35 patients each day. We have to calculate the number of beds occupied after 2 weeks. 
1 week is 7 days, so 2 weeks is 14 days.
The hospital admits 35 patients per day for 14 days, so the total number of patients admitted is 35 * 14 = 490.
The hospital has 100 beds occupied initially.
The total occupied beds after 2 weeks would be 100 + 490 = 590.

However, the hospital has a total capacity of 800 beds. We cannot have more than 800 occupied beds. The hospital has 800 beds and 590 patients are admitted, so the remaining capacity for the hospital to admit more patients is 800 - 590 = 210.

So, the total number of unoccupied beds is the difference between the total capacity and the occupied beds and the unoccupied and out-of-service beds, which is 800 - 590 = 210.

Andre is selling cupcakes and orange pies for a fundraiser. 

Step 1: Let's find out how many boxes of cupcakes and orange pies Andre sold on Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, he sold 24 boxes of cupcakes.
On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday, which is 24 + 11 = 35 boxes.
On Tuesday, he sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pie than on Tuesday, which is 28 - 16 = 12 boxes.

Step 2: Let's find out how many boxes of cupcakes and orange pies Andre sold on Wednesday.

On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined.
The total number of cupcakes sold on Monday and Tuesday is 24 + 35 = 59 boxes.
The total number of orange pies sold on Monday and Tuesday is 12 boxes.
However, we need to find the total number of cupcakes and orange pies sold on Monday and Tuesday.
The total number of cupcakes and orange pies sold on Monday and Tuesday is 59 + 12 = 71 boxes.
So, on Wednesday, he sold 71 boxes of cupcakes and 12 boxes of orange pie.

Step 3: Let's calculate Andre's total earnings from each day.

The total number of cupcakes sold on Monday is 24 * ₺10 = ₺240.
The total number of cupcakes sold on Tuesday is 35 * ₺10 = ₺350.
The total number of cupcakes sold on Wednesday is 71 * ₺10 = ₺710.
The total earnings from cupcakes is ₺240 + ₺350 + ₺710 = ₺1300.

The total number of orange pies sold on Monday is 0 since Andre sold 16 fewer boxes than on Tuesday.

First, we need to find out how many students are volleyball players.
24% of 125 students are volleyball players.
To find 24% of 125, we multiply 125 by 0.24.
So, the number of volleyball players is 125 * 0.24 = 30.

Next, we need to find out how many students are not volleyball players.
There are 125 students in total.
30 students are volleyball players.
So, the number of students who are not volleyball players is 125 - 30 = 95.

Now, we need to find out how many students are robotics club members or part of choir members.
40% of the remaining students are robotics club members or part of choir members.
To find 40% of 95, we multiply 95 by 0.40.

However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a €5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Mei spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",22.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total space needed for the plants and the space between them**

Mei wants to leave 13 feet between every plant, including the plant's width. So, the total space needed for each plant and the space between them is:
13 feet (space between plants) + 3 feet (plant's width) = 16 feet

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of plants Mei can fit in her flower bed**

The length of the flower bed is 143 feet. To find the total number of plants Mei can fit, we'll divide the length of the flower bed by the total space needed for each plant and the space between them:
143 feet / 16 feet = 8.9375

Since Mei can't fit a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, we'll also consider the fact that Mei already owns 8 flowers. Let's assume she wants to fill the entire flower bed.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of plants Mei needs to buy**

Since Mei already owns 8 flowers, we'll subtract that from the total number of plants she can fit:
8.9375 - 8 = 0.9375

Rounding up to the nearest whole number, Mei needs to buy 1 more plant to fill the entire flower bed.

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the plants**

Mei needs to buy 1 more plant, so the total number of plants she'll buy is:
8 (already owned) + 1 (new plant) = 9 plants

The cost of each plant is €9. Since Mei buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a €5 discount on the entire purchase. The total cost of the plants is:
9 plants x €9/plant = €81
€5 discount = €81 - €5 = €76

Mei's flower bed is 143 feet long. She needs to leave 13 feet between each plant, including the plant's width, which is 3 feet. 

So, the total space each plant will occupy is 3 feet (plant's width) + 13 feet (space between plants) = 16 feet.

Since Mei already owns 8 flowers, we first need to find the total space occupied by these 8 flowers: 
8 flowers * 16 feet = 128 feet.

Now, let's find the remaining space in the flower bed: 
143 feet (flower bed's length) - 128 feet (space occupied by the 8 flowers) = 15 feet.

Since each plant occupies 16 feet, Mei can fit only 1 more plant in the remaining space. 

So, the total number of plants Mei needs to buy is 8 (she already owns) + 1 (she needs to buy) = 9 plants.

Since Mei will buy more than 2 plants, she'll receive a €5 discount on the entire purchase.

However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a €5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Mei spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many plants Mei can fit in her flower bed. To do this, we need to find the total space required for each plant, including the space between them.

Each plant requires 3 feet for its width, and Mei needs to leave 13 feet between each plant. So, the total space required for each plant is 3 + 13 = 16 feet.

Now, let's divide the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant to find out how many plants Mei can fit.

143 feet (flower bed length) ÷ 16 feet (space per plant) = 8.9375 plants

Since Mei can't fit a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 8 plants (she already owns 8 flowers, so she needs to buy 0 more plants).

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider the discount that Mei will receive if she buys more than 2 plants.

If Mei buys 2 plants, she will not receive the discount, and each plant will cost €9. So, the total cost will be 2 * €9 = €18.

If Mei buys more than 2 plants, she will receive a €5 discount on the entire purchase. Since she needs to buy 8 plants, the total cost will be 8 * €9 = €72. However, she will receive a €5 discount, so the final cost will be €72 - €5 = €67.

But wait, we made another mistake! We assumed that Mei needs to buy 8 plants, but we didn't consider the space between the plants. Let's recalculate the number of plants Mei can fit.

143 feet (flower bed length) ÷ 16 feet (space per plant) = 8.9375 plants

Since Mei can't fit a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 8 plants. However, this will leave some space at the end of the flower bed. Let's calculate the total space required for 8 plants:

8 plants * 16 feet (space per plant) = 128 feet

This leaves 143 - 128 = 15 feet of space at the end of the flower bed. Since Mei can't fit a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 0 additional plants.

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider the discount that Mei will receive if she buys more than 2 plants.

If Mei buys 2 plants, she will not receive the discount, and each plant will cost €9. So, the total cost will be 2 * €9 = €18.

If Mei buys more than 2 plants, she will receive a €5 discount on the entire purchase. Since she needs to buy 8 plants, the total cost will be 8 * €9 = €72. However, she will receive a €5 discount, so the final cost will be €72 - €5 = €67.

How long will it take her to peel and saute 60 clams if it takes 19 minutes to wash all the clams? Note that Yara can't work in parallel.,53.0,"To find the total time it takes Yara to complete the task, we need to break it down into steps and calculate each one.

Step 1: Wash the clams (already given)
Time taken: 19 minutes

Step 2: Peel the clams
Yara can peel 6 clams per minute. To peel 60 clams, she will take:
60 / 6 = 10 minutes

Step 3: Saute the peeled clams
Yara can saute 20 clams in 8 minutes. To saute 60 clams, we first need to find out how many times she needs to repeat the process:
60 / 20 = 3. 
Since she can saute 20 clams at a time, she will have to saute 3 sets of 20 clams. 
Each set takes 8 minutes, so the total time to saute 60 clams will be:
3 * 8 = 24 minutes

Now, let's add up the time for each step:
19 (wash) + 10 (peel) + 24 (saute) = 53 minutes

So, it will take Yara 53 minutes to peel and saute 60 clams.",60.0,0,"I'll follow the format you provided to solve the problem step by step.

Q: Yara can peel 6 clams a minute and saute 20 clams in 8 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 60 clams if it takes 19 minutes to wash all the clams? Note that Yara can't work in parallel.

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate how long it takes Yara to peel 60 clams.
Yara can peel 6 clams a minute.
So, to peel 60 clams, it will take her 60 / 6 = 10 minutes.

Next, let's calculate how long it takes Yara to saute 60 clams.
Yara can saute 20 clams in 8 minutes.
To find out how many minutes it takes to saute 60 clams, we can set up a proportion:
20 clams / 8 minutes = 60 clams / x minutes
Cross-multiplying, we get:
20x = 60 * 8
20x = 480
Dividing both sides by 20, we get:
x = 480 / 20
x = 24 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to peel and saute the clams to the time it takes to wash them.
It takes 19 minutes to wash the clams.
It takes 10 minutes to peel the clams.
It takes 24 minutes to saute the clams.
So, the total time it takes Yara to peel and saute 60 clams is:
19 + 10 + 24 = 53 minutes

Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet. How much older is Liam's uncle than Liam?,22.0,"To find out how much older Liam's uncle is than Liam, we need to first find out how old Liam was when he saw the comet for the second time. 

Since Liam's uncle was 31 years old when he saw the comet, Liam will see the comet when his uncle's age at the first time of seeing the comet is doubled.

So, when Liam's uncle was 31 years old, Liam was not there, but when his uncle was 31 years old, and 2 * 31 = 62 years have passed, Liam will be 2 * 31 = 62 years old.

But, this is after 2 periods of the comet's orbit, because Liam's uncle was 31 years old when he first saw the comet, so 2 * 53 = 106 years have passed.

So when Liam is 62 years old, it has been 106 years since Liam's uncle first saw the comet.

Now we have to find Liam's age at that time. 106 years have passed since Liam's uncle first saw the comet, and 53 years have passed since Liam saw the comet for the first time, so 106 - 53 = 53 years have passed since Liam first saw the comet.

Since 53 years have passed since Liam saw the comet for the first time, and 53 years have passed since the comet's orbit period, we know that 53 + 53 = 106 years have passed since Liam's uncle first saw the comet.

So, when Liam is 62 years old, it has been 53 years since Liam first saw the comet. We can find Liam's age when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 53 from 62. 

62 - 53 = 9

So, Liam was 9 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Now we can find the age difference between Liam and his uncle by subtracting Liam's age from his uncle's age. 

31 - 9 = 22

So, Liam's uncle is 22 years older than Liam.",22.0,1,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Liam's uncle saw the comet when he was 31 years old.
Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet.
So, Liam was 2 * 31 = 62 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Now, we need to find out how old Liam's uncle is now.
Since Liam's uncle saw the comet 53 years ago, he is now 31 + 53 = 84 years old.

Next, we need to find out how old Liam is now.
Since Liam saw the comet for the second time 53 years ago, he is now 62 + 53 = 115 years old.

Finally, we need to find out how much older Liam's uncle is than Liam.
Liam's uncle is 84 years old, and Liam is 115 years old.
So, Liam's uncle is 115 - 84 = 31 years older than Liam.

The answer is 31.",31.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Liam's uncle saw the comet when he was 31 years old.
This means that the time between the two sightings is 53 years.
Since Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet, we can calculate Liam's age at the second sighting.
Liam's uncle was 31 years old when he first saw the comet.
So, Liam was 2 * 31 = 62 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
Now, we need to find out how much older Liam's uncle is than Liam.
Liam's uncle is 31 years old, and Liam is 62 years old.
So, the difference in their ages is 62 - 31 = 31.
However, this is the difference in their ages at the time of the second sighting.
Since the time between the two sightings is 53 years, we need to subtract 53 from Liam's age to find his age at the time of the first sighting.
Liam's age at the first sighting is 62 - 53 = 9 years old.
Now, we can find the difference in their ages at the time of the first sighting.
Liam's uncle is 31 years old, and Liam is 9 years old.
So, the difference in their ages is 31 - 9 = 22.
However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We want to find the difference in their ages at the present time.
Since 53 years have passed since the first sighting, we need to add 53 to Liam's age at the first sighting to find his current age.
Liam's current age is 9 + 53 = 62 years old.
Liam's uncle is still 31 years old.
So, the difference in their ages at the present time is 62 - 31 = 31.
However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We want to find the difference in their ages, not the difference in their ages at the present time.
We are looking for the difference in their ages at the time of the second sighting, not the present time.

1. Ali picks 114 bananas on Monday.
2. Then, he picks 62 bananas on Tuesday.
3. The total number of bananas Ali picked from Monday to Tuesday is 114 + 62 = 176 bananas.
4. On Wednesday, Ali picks quintuple the number of bananas he did on Monday. Quintuple means 5 times the original amount. So, 5 * 114 = 570 bananas.

On Wednesday, he picks quintuple the number of bananas he did on Monday.
Quintuple means 5 times the original number.
So, the number of bananas Ali picks on Wednesday is 5 * 114 = 570.

How many hamburgers does this family eat in one week?",56.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The grandfather eats 2 hamburgers per day.
2. The partner eats 4 hamburgers per day.
3. The son eats one less than two-fourths of the number of hamburgers they eat combined per day. Let's calculate the combined number of hamburgers they eat per day:
   Grandfather + Partner = 2 + 4 = 6 hamburgers per day
   Two-fourths of 6 hamburgers is (2/4) × 6 = 3 hamburgers
   One less than 3 hamburgers is 3 - 1 = 2 hamburgers per day

Now, let's calculate the total number of hamburgers they eat per day:
Grandfather + Partner + Son = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 hamburgers per day

To find out how many hamburgers they eat in one week, we need to multiply the daily total by 7:
8 hamburgers per day × 7 days per week = 56 hamburgers per week

Therefore, this family eats 56 hamburgers in one week.",56.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The grandfather eats 2 hamburgers per day.
The partner eats 4 hamburgers per day.
So, the combined number of hamburgers eaten by them per day is 2 + 4 = 6.

Now, the son eats one less than two-fourths of the number of hamburgers they eat combined per day. 
Two-fourths of the combined number is (2/4) * 6 = 3.
One less than that is 3 - 1 = 2.
So, the son eats 2 hamburgers per day.

The family eats a total of 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 hamburgers per day.

In one week, there are 7 days. 
So, the total number of hamburgers the family eats in one week is 8 * 7 = 56.

Now, we subtract the toys found by the twins from the initial number of toys to find the remaining toys: 
100 - 52 = 48 toys

However, we are told that all the remaining toys except 16 were found by their friends. This means the friends found 48 - 16 = 32 toys.

To find the percentage of toys the friends found, we divide the number of toys they found by the initial number of toys and multiply by 100:
(32 / 100) * 100 = 32%

So, the friends found 32% of the initially hidden toys.",32.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Now, let's calculate the number of toys left after the twins have found their share. 
The number of toys left is 100 - 52 = 48.

The friends found all the remaining toys except 16, so the number of toys found by the friends is 48 - 16 = 32.

To find the percentage of the initially hidden toys that the friends found, we need to divide the number of toys found by the friends by the initial total, and then multiply by 100.

He can mine twice as much with one bronze pickaxe and 80% more with a diamond pickaxe than with one bronze pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 11 miners mine in a month with 28 days if they all use bronze pickaxe in the first half, and then switch to diamond pickaxes in the second half of the month?",4312.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of ore one miner can mine with a bronze pickaxe and a diamond pickaxe**

With a bronze pickaxe, one miner can mine twice as much as with a basic shovel, which is 2 × 5 = 10 pounds of ore per day.

With a diamond pickaxe, one miner can mine 80% more than with a bronze pickaxe. To calculate 80% of 10 pounds, we multiply 10 by 0.8, which is 8 pounds. Then, we add this to 10 pounds to get the total: 10 + 8 = 18 pounds of ore per day.

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of ore one miner can mine in a month**

Since there are 28 days in a month, we multiply the daily amount of ore by 28 to get the monthly amount:

With a bronze pickaxe: 10 pounds/day × 28 days = 280 pounds/month
With a diamond pickaxe: 18 pounds/day × 28 days = 504 pounds/month

**Step 3: Calculate the amount of ore 11 miners can mine in the first half of the month (using bronze pickaxes)**

Since there are 14 days in the first half of the month, we multiply the daily amount of ore by 14 and then by 11 miners:

280 pounds/day × 14 days = 3920 pounds
3920 pounds × 11 miners = 43,120 pounds

**Step 4: Calculate the amount of ore 11 miners can mine in the second half of the month (using diamond pickaxes)**

Since there are 14 days in the second half of the month, we multiply the daily amount of ore by 14 and then by 11 miners:

504 pounds/day × 14 days = 7056 pounds
7056 pounds × 11 miners = 77,616 pounds

**Step 5: Calculate the total amount of ore 11 miners can mine in a month**

We add the amounts of ore mined in the first and second halves of the month:

43,120 pounds + 77,616 pounds = 120,736 pounds

Therefore, 11 miners can mine 120,736 pounds of ore in a month with 28 days if they all use bronze pickaxes in the first half and then switch to diamond pickaxes in the second half of the month.",28.0,0,"I'll break down the problem step by step.

First, let's find out how many pounds of ore one miner can mine in a month with a bronze pickaxe and a diamond pickaxe.

One miner can mine 5 pounds of ore per day with a basic shovel.
He can mine twice as much with a bronze pickaxe, so he can mine 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of ore per day with a bronze pickaxe.
He can mine 80% more with a diamond pickaxe than with a bronze pickaxe, so he can mine 10 + (10 * 0.8) = 10 + 8 = 18 pounds of ore per day with a diamond pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how many pounds of ore one miner can mine in a month with a bronze pickaxe and a diamond pickaxe.

There are 28 days in a month, so one miner can mine:
10 pounds/day * 14 days = 140 pounds with a bronze pickaxe
18 pounds/day * 14 days = 252 pounds with a diamond pickaxe

Now, let's find out how many pounds of ore 11 miners can mine in a month with a bronze pickaxe and a diamond pickaxe.

11 miners can mine:
140 pounds * 11 = 1540 pounds with a bronze pickaxe
252 pounds * 11 = 2772 pounds with a diamond pickaxe

Since they switch to diamond pickaxes in the second half of the month, we need to find the total number of pounds of ore they can mine in a month.

The first half of the month has 14 days, and the second half has 14 days. So, the total number of pounds of ore they can mine in a month is:
1540 pounds + 2772 pounds = 4312 pounds

After accounting for 900 seats for the graduates, 300 seats for the faculty attending, and reserving 100 seats for the event's staff, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?",9.0,"To determine how many tickets each graduate would receive, we first need to find out the total number of available seats for guests. 

The total capacity of the Sports Arena is 9400. We subtract the seats reserved for the graduates, faculty, and staff.

1. Subtract the seats for the graduates: 9400 - 900 = 8500
2. Subtract the seats for the faculty: 8500 - 300 = 8200
3. Subtract the seats for the staff: 8200 - 100 = 8100

Now we know there are 8100 available seats for guests. This means each graduate would receive the same number of tickets to distribute to their friends and family. To find this number, we divide the total available seats by the number of graduates.

Number of graduates: 9400 - 900 (seats reserved for graduates) = 8500 graduates

Now, divide the total available seats by the number of graduates:

8100 available seats / 8500 graduates = 0.95 tickets per graduate

Since we can't give a fraction of a ticket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, allowing each graduate to give out 0 tickets to their guests.",0.0,0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

The total capacity of the Sports Arena is 9400 people.
900 seats are reserved for the graduates themselves, so they will not receive tickets for these seats.
300 seats are reserved for the faculty, so they will not receive tickets for these seats either.
Additionally, 100 seats are reserved for the event's staff, so these seats will not be available for the guests of the graduates.

Let's calculate the total number of seats reserved:
900 (for the graduates) + 300 (for the faculty) + 100 (for the staff) = 1300 seats

The number of seats available for guests is the total capacity minus the reserved seats:
9400 (total capacity) - 1300 (reserved seats) = 8100 seats

Since the tickets are split equally among the graduates, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive:
8100 (available seats) / (the number of graduates, which is 900) = 9 tickets per graduate.

However, the prompt does not specify how many graduates are there. So, I assume that the prompt is asking for the number of tickets that each of the 900 graduates would get or if it's asking for the number of graduates it will be 9400 - 1300 = 8100 people / 9 = 900 graduates.

How many emails does Sophia respond to in a 5-day work week?",260.0,"To find out how many emails Sophia responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the number of emails Sophia receives in a 5-day work week.
Emails per day = 150
Emails in 5 days = 150 * 5 = 750

Step 2: Calculate the number of emails that don't require any response.
Percentage of emails that don't require response = 16%
Number of emails that don't require response = 16% of 750
= 0.16 * 750
= 120

Step 3: Calculate the number of emails that require a response.
Emails that require response = Total emails - Emails that don't require response
= 750 - 120
= 630

Step 4: Calculate the number of emails Sophia can respond to.
Half of the emails that require response = 630 / 2
= 315
11 less than half = 315 - 11
= 304

Step 5: Calculate the total number of emails Sophia responds to in a 5-day work week.
Total emails responded to = Emails that require response - Emails Sophia can respond to
However, since the emails that require response is the total number of emails that require response, we can simply take the number of emails Sophia can respond to.
= 304

Therefore, Sophia responds to 304 emails in a 5-day work week.",5.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Sophia receives 150 emails a day.
16% of those emails don't require any response.
To find 16% of 150, we multiply 150 by 0.16.
So, 150 * 0.16 = 24 emails don't require any response.
The number of emails that require a response is 150 - 24 = 126.
From the rest, Sophia can only respond to 11 less than half of them.
Half of 126 is 126 / 2 = 63.
11 less than half is 63 - 11 = 52.
So, Sophia responds to 52 emails in a day.
In a 5-day work week, Sophia responds to 52 * 5 = 260 emails.

Since Tara gets 190 yards more than Ananya, Tara gets x + 190 yards.

Since Umar gets 30 yards more than Tara, Umar gets (x + 190) + 30 = x + 220 yards.

We know that the total amount of fence is 860 yards, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 190) + (x + 220) = 860

Umar gets 30 yards more than Tara, so Umar has (x + 190) + 30 yards.

We know the total number of yards is 860, so the sum of Ananya's, Tara's, and Umar's yards is equal to 860:

x + (x + 190) + ((x + 190) + 30) = 860

x + x + 190 + x + 190 + 30 = 860

1. Extra classes:
   - Number of classes: 3
   - Time per class: 30 minutes
   - Time spent before each class: 15 minutes
   - Total time spent before classes: 3 * 15 = 45 minutes
   - Total time spent on each class including review: 30 + 15 = 45 minutes
   - Total time spent on 3 extra classes: 3 * 45 = 135 minutes

2. Regular class time:
   - Number of periods: 6 + 3 = 9 periods
   - Time per period: 45 minutes (assuming a standard 45-minute period)
   - Total time spent in regular classes: 9 * 45 = 405 minutes

3. Total time spent in classes (regular and extra): 135 + 405 = 540 minutes

4. Weekly class time: 
   - Since Santiago goes to class for 4 days a week, the total class time is 540 minutes/day * 4 days = 2160 minutes

5. Extra learning time on weekends:
   - Total minutes in a week: 7 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 20,160 minutes

Since he has 3 extra classes, the total time spent in class and preparation for all 3 classes is 3 * 45 = 135 minutes.

Since he goes to class for 4 days a week, the total time spent in class and preparation for the week is 135 * 4 = 540 minutes.

Now, let's convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total time in hours is 540 / 60 = 9 hours.

Santiago also spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. Since he spends 540 minutes in class and preparation during the week, the total weekly minutes is 540 + (1/9) * 540.

Purple balls: 11 balls × ₣9 per ball = ₣99
Pink balls: 17 balls × ₣4 per ball = ₣68

On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?",75.0,"Let's break this problem down step by step.

Initially, Olivia walks 10 kilometers on the beach and 10 kilometers on the sidewalk. We know that she walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. 

Let's assume her initial speed on the beach is 'x' kilometers per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 4x kilometers per minute.

Since her speed has decreased by half on both the beach and sidewalk, her new speed on the beach is x/2 kilometers per minute and on the sidewalk is 4x/2 = 2x kilometers per minute.

We are given that 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. Since she walks on the beach at a speed of x/2 kilometers per minute, we can calculate the distance covered on the beach as:

Distance = Speed * Time = (x/2) * 60

Since the distance she covers on the beach is 10 kilometers, we can equate this to 10 kilometers and solve for 'x':

10 = (x/2) * 60
20 = 60x
x = 1/3

Now we know her speed on the beach is 1/3 kilometers per minute and on the sidewalk is 2 * (1/3) = 2/3 kilometers per minute.

To find the time taken to walk on the sidewalk, we can divide the distance by the speed:

Time = Distance / Speed = 10 / (2/3) = 10 * (3/2) = 15 minutes

The total time taken to complete the 20-kilometer walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk:

Total Time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk
= 60 + 15
= 75 minutes

Therefore, it will take Olivia 75 minutes to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk.",20.0,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Olivia walks 20 kilometers every day, which includes 10 kilometers on the beach and 10 kilometers on the sidewalk.

Let's first find out how long it takes her to walk 10 kilometers on the beach at her normal speed. However, due to her injury, her speed has decreased by half. So, her new speed on the beach is half of her original speed.

Since we don't know her original speed, let's call it x kilometers per minute. Then, her new speed on the beach is x/2 kilometers per minute.

We know that it takes her 60 minutes to walk 10 kilometers on the beach at her new speed. So, we can set up the equation:

10 km / (x/2 km/min) = 60 min

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by x/2:

10 * (x/2) = 60 * (x/2)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

5x = 60

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:

x = 12 km/min

So, Olivia's original speed on the beach is 12 kilometers per minute.

Now, let's find out how long it takes her to walk 10 kilometers on the beach at her new speed (6 km/min):

Time = Distance / Speed
= 10 km / 6 km/min
= 1.67 min (approximately)

However, we are not asked to find the time it takes her to walk on the beach. We are asked to find the total time it takes her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk.

Since she walks 10 kilometers on the beach and 10 kilometers on the sidewalk, we can add the times it takes her to walk on both surfaces:

Time on beach = 60 min
Time on sidewalk = Time on beach / (Speed on sidewalk / Speed on beach)
= 60 min / (4 * 0.5)
= 60 min / 2
= 30 min

Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
= 60 min + 30 min
= 90 min

The answer is 90.",90.0,0,"I'll provide the corrected reasoning and answer in the examples format.

Let's think step by step.

Olivia walks 20 kilometers every day, which includes 10 kilometers on the beach and 10 kilometers on the sidewalk.

On the beach, Olivia walks at a certain speed, but due to an injury, her speed has decreased by half. Let's call her original speed on the beach ""x"" kilometers per minute. Then, her new speed on the beach is x/2 kilometers per minute.

On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. So, her original speed on the sidewalk is 4x kilometers per minute. However, due to the injury, her speed on the sidewalk has also decreased by half. Therefore, her new speed on the sidewalk is (4x)/2 = 2x kilometers per minute.

We are given that 60 minutes of Olivia's walk is spent on the beach. Since she walks 10 kilometers on the beach, we can set up the equation:

10 kilometers / (x/2 kilometers per minute) = 60 minutes

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (x/2):

10 = 60(x/2)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

10 = 30x

Dividing both sides by 30, we get:

x = 1/3 kilometers per minute

Now that we know Olivia's speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk:

Speed on the sidewalk = 2x = 2(1/3) = 2/3 kilometers per minute

Since Olivia walks 10 kilometers on the sidewalk, we can find the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk:

Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 10 kilometers / (2/3 kilometers per minute) = 15 minutes

Now, we know that Olivia spends 60 minutes on the beach and 15 minutes on the sidewalk. To find the total time it takes her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, we add the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk:

Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk = 60 minutes + 15 minutes = 75 minutes

First, let's calculate the number of pancakes Arjun eats in the first 57 days:

3 pancakes/day × 57 days = 171 pancakes

Since there are 7 days in a week, 10 weeks is equal to 10 × 7 = 70 days.

Arjun eats 3 pancakes a day for 57 days, and then he eats 9 pancakes a day for the remaining days. The number of remaining days is 70 - 57 = 13 days.

9 pancakes/day × 13 days = 117 pancakes

Now, let's add the number of pancakes Arjun eats in the first 57 days and the number of pancakes he eats in the remaining 13 days:

171 pancakes + 117 pancakes = 288 pancakes

Since there are 12 pancakes in a dozen, we can divide the total number of pancakes by 12 to find the number of dozens:

288 pancakes ÷ 12 = 24 dozens

Therefore, Arjun will need 24 dozens of pancakes for 10 weeks.",10.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Arjun eats 3 pancakes a day for 57 days.
So, the number of pancakes he eats in 57 days is 3 * 57 = 171.

The total number of days is 57 + 70 = 127 days.
Arjun eats 3 pancakes a day for 57 days, and 9 pancakes a day for the rest of the days.
So, for the rest of the days, he eats 9 * 70 = 630 pancakes.
The total number of pancakes he eats in 127 days is 171 + 630 = 801.
Since there are 12 pancakes in a dozen, the total number of dozens of pancakes Arjun needs is 801 / 12 = 66.75.
However, we can't buy a fraction of a dozen, so we round down to the nearest whole number.

Since there are 10 weeks, we need to find the number of days in 10 weeks.
There are 7 days in a week, so 10 weeks have 10 * 7 = 70 days.

The total number of days Arjun eats 9 pancakes a day is 70 days.
So, the total number of pancakes eaten in 70 days is 9 * 70 = 630.

The total number of pancakes Arjun needs is the sum of the pancakes eaten in 57 days and 70 days.
So, the total number of pancakes is 171 + 630 = 801.

Since there are 12 pancakes in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of pancakes by 12 to find the number of dozens.

So, the total time to clean 180 floors is 180 * 6 = 1080 minutes.

Since they work for 6 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, 
6 hours = 6 * 60 = 360 minutes per day.

Given that it will take them twice as long to clean a floor after the injury, 
the new time per floor will be 2 * 6 = 12 minutes.

Now, let's find the total time to clean 180 floors at the new rate:
180 floors * 12 minutes per floor = 2160 minutes.

To find the fraction of the day spent cleaning floors, we'll divide the total time spent cleaning by the total time available in a day:
Time spent cleaning / Total time available = 2160 minutes / 360 minutes.

To find the percentage, we'll multiply by 100:
(2160 / 360) * 100 = 600%.

However, it's not possible for someone to spend more than 100% of their day cleaning floors. This suggests an error in the calculation.

The error is in the last step. The time spent cleaning in the last step is correct, but it's the time available in a day that should be converted to minutes and compared with the actual time spent. 

Let's rethink the last step.

The total time for 180 floors at the new rate is 2160 minutes.
However, the calculation of the total time the worker is available to work is still correct.

To find the fraction of the day spent cleaning, let's calculate the fraction of the day available for cleaning at the new rate.
Time available for cleaning at the new rate is the total available time minus the time it takes to do the task at the new rate. 
Since it takes 2160 minutes to clean the floors at the new rate, and there are 360 minutes available each day, 
the available time for cleaning at the new rate is 0 since the time taken to complete the task is more than the available time.",0.0,0,"A: Let's think step by step.

The maintenance worker has to clean 180 floors in 10 days.

It takes them 6 minutes per floor initially.
However, due to an injury, it now takes them twice as long, which is 6 * 2 = 12 minutes per floor.

They work for 6 hours a day, which is 6 * 60 = 360 minutes.

In one day, they can clean 360 / 12 = 30 floors.

In 10 days, they can clean 30 * 10 = 300 floors.

Since they have to clean 180 floors, they will not finish in 10 days. They will clean 300 floors in 10 days, but they only need to clean 180 floors.

So, the number of floors they clean per day is 300 / 10 = 30 floors.

The percentage of their day spent cleaning floors is (30 / 30) * 100 = 100%.

However, this is not the correct answer because they will not finish cleaning all the floors in 10 days. They will finish cleaning 180 floors in 180 / 30 = 6 days.

In 6 days, they will clean 30 * 6 = 180 floors.

In the remaining 4 days, they will clean 30 * 4 = 120 floors.

In 10 days, they will clean 180 + 120 = 300 floors.

The number of floors they clean per day is 300 / 10 = 30 floors.

The percentage of their day spent cleaning floors is (30 / 30) * 100 = 100%.

However, this is still not the correct answer because we need to find the percentage of their day spent cleaning floors on average, considering they will finish cleaning 180 floors in 6 days.

In 6 days, they will clean 180 floors.
The number of floors they clean per day is 180 / 6 = 30 floors.

The percentage of their day spent cleaning floors is (30 / 30) * 100 = 100%.

In the remaining 4 days, they will clean 120 floors.

If there are 40 cubes in the pyramid in total, what percentage of cubes are white?",40.0,"To find the percentage of white cubes, we need to first find the number of white cubes.

Let's start by finding the total number of green and black cubes.

Number of green cubes = 4
Number of black cubes = 5 times the number of green cubes = 5 * 4 = 20

Total number of green and black cubes = 4 + 20 = 24

Since there are 40 cubes in total, the number of white cubes can be found by subtracting the number of green and black cubes from the total number of cubes.

Number of white cubes = Total number of cubes - (Number of green cubes + Number of black cubes)

There are 40 cubes in the pyramid in total.
The number of white cubes is the difference between the total and the green and black cubes.

Each of his 4 children weighs 65 pounds, so the total weight of the children is 4 * 65 = 260 pounds.
Each spare tire weighs 70 pounds, and he has 2 spare tires, so the total weight of the spare tires is 2 * 70 = 140 pounds.

The total weight is 1350 + 450 + 260 + 140 = 2100 pounds.

The force needed to move the car is 2% of the total weight.
To find 2% of the total weight, we need to multiply the total weight by 0.02 (which is the decimal equivalent of 2%).
So, the force needed is 2100 * 0.02 = 42 pounds.

The answer is 42.",42.0,0,"The problem statement is a bit more complex than the examples provided, but I'll break it down step by step.

We need to calculate the total weight of the car and its contents, then find 2% of that total to determine the force needed to move it.

Let's think step by step.

The car weighs 1350 pounds.
The luggage weighs 450 pounds.
The four children weigh 65 pounds each, so the total weight of the children is 4 * 65 = 260 pounds.
The two spare tires weigh 70 pounds each, so the total weight of the tires is 2 * 70 = 140 pounds.

So, the total weight of the car and its contents is 1350 + 450 + 260 + 140 = 2100 pounds.

To find 2% of the total weight, we multiply the total weight by 0.02 (which is equivalent to 2%).
So, 2% of the total weight is 2100 * 0.02 = 42.0 pounds.

However, this is the correct solution, as the initial answer was 42.0 pounds, which is actually correct. 

The answer is 42.0",42.0,0
gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct,"Oscar, Arash are currently 27 years apart in age. Oscar and Ali are currently 18 years apart. If Oscar, who is younger than Arash but older than Ali, is 54 years old, what's the average of their ages?",57.0,"To find the average age, we need to know the ages of all three individuals. 

Since Oscar is 54 and 27 years younger than Arash, Arash is 54 + 27 = 81 years old.

We also know that Oscar and Ali are 18 years apart, and since Oscar is older than Ali, we subtract 18 from Oscar's age to find Ali's age. Ali is 54 - 18 = 36 years old.

Now we have the ages of all three individuals: Oscar (54), Arash (81), and Ali (36).

To find the average, we add their ages and divide by 3: (54 + 81 + 36) / 3.

First, add their ages: 54 + 81 + 36 = 171.

Then, divide by 3: 171 / 3 = 57.

The average age of Oscar, Arash, and Ali is 57.",57.0,1,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Let's think step by step.

Oscar is 54 years old.

Oscar and Ali are 18 years apart in age. This means Ali is 54 - 18 = 36 years old.

Oscar and Arash are 27 years apart in age. Since Oscar is younger than Arash, Arash is 54 + 27 = 81 years old.

Now we have the ages of all three: Oscar (54), Ali (36), and Arash (81).

To find the average of their ages, we need to add their ages and divide by 3.

The sum of their ages is 54 + 36 + 81 = 171.

There are 3 people, so we divide the sum by 3: 171 / 3 = 57.

The answer is 57.",57.0,1,,57.0,1

They have 1126 peanut butter cupcakes, 1634 lemon cupcakes, and some blueberry cupcakes. What percentage of the cupcakes they have made are blueberry cupcakes?",60.0,"To find the percentage of blueberry cupcakes, we need to first find the total number of blueberry cupcakes. We can do this by subtracting the number of peanut butter and lemon cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes.

Total cupcakes = 6900
Peanut butter cupcakes = 1126
Lemon cupcakes = 1634

Blueberry cupcakes = Total cupcakes - (Peanut butter cupcakes + Lemon cupcakes)
Blueberry cupcakes = 6900 - (1126 + 1634)
Blueberry cupcakes = 6900 - 2760
Blueberry cupcakes = 4140

Now, we can find the percentage of blueberry cupcakes by dividing the number of blueberry cupcakes by the total number of cupcakes and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blueberry cupcakes = (Blueberry cupcakes / Total cupcakes) * 100
Percentage of blueberry cupcakes = (4140 / 6900) * 100
Percentage of blueberry cupcakes = 0.597 * 100
Percentage of blueberry cupcakes = 59.7%

So, the Smith family has made 59.7% blueberry cupcakes.",59.7,0,"Let's think step by step.

The Smith family made 6900 cupcakes in total.
They made 1126 peanut butter cupcakes and 1634 lemon cupcakes.
So, the total number of non-blueberry cupcakes is 1126 + 1634 = 2760.

To find the number of blueberry cupcakes, we need to subtract the non-blueberry cupcakes from the total.
The number of blueberry cupcakes is 6900 - 2760 = 4140.

To find the percentage of blueberry cupcakes, we will divide the number of blueberry cupcakes by the total number of cupcakes and multiply by 100.
Percentage of blueberry cupcakes = (4140 / 6900) * 100 = 60%.
