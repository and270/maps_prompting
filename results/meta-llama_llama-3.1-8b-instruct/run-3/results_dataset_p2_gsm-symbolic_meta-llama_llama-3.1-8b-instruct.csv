gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct,"Sophia went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, and 60 mini cheesecakes. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of donuts**

Sophia bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen. Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, we can calculate the number of dozens of donuts she bought:

60 donuts ÷ 12 donuts/dozen = 5 dozen donuts

The cost of 5 dozen donuts is:

5 dozen donuts × $19/dozen = $95

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of mini cupcakes**

Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen. Since there are 12 cupcakes in a dozen, we can calculate the number of dozens of cupcakes she bought:

60 cupcakes ÷ 12 cupcakes/dozen = 5 dozen cupcakes

The cost of 5 dozen cupcakes is:

5 dozen cupcakes × $33/dozen = $165

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of donuts and cupcakes**

The total cost of donuts and cupcakes is:

$95 (donuts) + $165 (cupcakes) = $260

**Step 4: Calculate the cost of mini cheesecakes**

After a 20% discount, Sophia paid a total of $1500. Let's call the total cost before the discount ""x"". Since the discount is 20%, the amount of the discount is 20% of x, which is 0.20x.

The amount Sophia paid after the discount is the original cost minus the discount:

x - 0.20x = 0.80x

We know that 0.80x = $1500. To find x, we can divide both sides by 0.80:

x = $1500 ÷ 0.80
x = $1875

So the total cost before the discount is $1875.

**Step 5: Calculate the cost of mini cheesecakes**

The total cost of donuts and cupcakes is $260. The total cost before the discount is $1875. Therefore, the cost of mini cheesecakes is:

$1875 (total cost before discount) - $260 (cost of donuts and cupcakes) = $1615

Since Sophia bought 60 mini cheesecakes, we can calculate the cost per dozen:

$1615 ÷ 5 dozen cheesecakes = $323 per dozen cheesecakes

Therefore, the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is $323.",323.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes before the discount.

Sophia bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen. Since 60 is 5 dozen, the total cost of the donuts is 5 * $19 = $95.

She also bought 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen. Since 60 is 5 dozen, the total cost of the mini cupcakes is 5 * $33 = $165.

The total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes is $95 + $165 = $260.

Since Sophia paid a total of $1500 after a 20% discount, we can find the original total cost before the discount by dividing $1500 by 0.8 (1 - 0.2).

The original total cost is $1500 / 0.8 = $1875.

Now, we can find the cost of the mini cheesecakes by subtracting the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes from the original total cost.

The cost of the mini cheesecakes is $1875 - $260 = $1615.

Since Sophia bought 60 mini cheesecakes, we can find the cost per dozen by dividing the total cost by 5 (since 60 is 5 dozen).

The cost per dozen of the mini cheesecakes is $1615 / 5 = $323.

The answer is $323.",323.0,1,,323.0,1

The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?",350.0,"To determine how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara, I need to calculate the total calories each of them needs to consume and then find out how much popcorn each of them needs to eat.

First, let's calculate Hiroshi's total daily calorie target:
Hiroshi's weight: 220 lbs
Daily calorie target per pound: 15 calories
Total daily calorie target: 220 * 15 = 3300 calories

Hiroshi has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise, so he still needs:
3300 - 1100 - 200 = 2000 calories

Now, let's calculate Tara's total daily calorie target:
Tara's weight: 140 lbs
Daily calorie target per pound: 15 calories
Total daily calorie target: 140 * 15 = 2100 calories

Tara has already consumed 900 calories and burned 200 calories in ice cream, so she still needs:
2100 - 900 - 200 = 1000 calories

Now, let's find out how much popcorn each of them needs to eat to reach their calorie targets:
Popcorn calories per serving: 200 calories
Hiroshi's remaining calories: 2000
Number of servings of popcorn for Hiroshi: 2000 / 200 = 10 servings
Since a 300g bag has 6 servings, Hiroshi needs to eat:
10 / 6 = 1.67 bags of popcorn (or approximately 1.67 * 300 = 500.1 grams)

Tara's remaining calories: 1000
Number of servings of popcorn for Tara: 1000 / 200 = 5 servings
Since a 300g bag has 6 servings, Tara needs to eat:
5 / 6 = 0.83 bags of popcorn (or approximately 0.83 * 300 = 249 grams)

Now, let's find the difference between the amount of popcorn Hiroshi and Tara need to eat:
Difference = 500.1 - 249 = 251.1 grams

Hiroshi needs to consume 251.1 grams of popcorn more than Tara.",251.1,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the daily calorie target for Hiroshi and Tara.

Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. So, Hiroshi's daily calorie target is 220 * 15 = 3300 calories.

Tara weighs 140 lbs. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. So, Tara's daily calorie target is 140 * 15 = 2100 calories.

Next, let's calculate how many calories Hiroshi and Tara have left to consume.

Hiroshi has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. So, he has 1100 - 200 = 900 calories left to consume.

Tara has already consumed 900 calories in food and 200 calories in ice cream. So, she has 900 - 200 = 700 calories left to consume.

Since the bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving and 6 servings, the total calories in the bag are 200 * 6 = 1200 calories.

Now, let's calculate how many grams of popcorn Hiroshi and Tara need to consume to reach their daily calorie targets.

Hiroshi needs to consume 3300 - 900 = 2400 calories. Since each serving has 1200 calories, he needs to consume 2400 / 1200 = 2 servings.

Tara needs to consume 2100 - 700 = 1400 calories. Since each serving has 1200 calories, she needs to consume 1400 / 1200 = 1.17 servings (round down to 1 serving since you can't consume a fraction of a serving).

Since each serving is 300 grams, Hiroshi needs to consume 2 * 300 = 600 grams of popcorn, and Tara needs to consume 1 * 300 = 300 grams of popcorn.

Finally, let's calculate how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara.

Hiroshi needs to consume 600 grams of popcorn, and Tara needs to consume 300 grams of popcorn. So, Hiroshi needs to consume 600 - 300 = 300 more grams of popcorn than Tara.

The answer is 300.",300.0,0,"Q: How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?
A: Let's think step by step.

Hiroshi's daily calorie target is 15 calories/pound * 220 pounds = 15 * 220 = 3300 calories.
He has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories.
So, he still needs 3300 - (1100 + 200) = 3300 - 1300 = 2000 calories.

Tara's daily calorie target is 15 calories/pound * 140 pounds = 15 * 140 = 2100 calories.
She has already consumed 900 calories in food and 200 calories in ice cream.
So, she still needs 2100 - (900 + 200) = 2100 - 1100 = 1000 calories.

To determine how many grams of popcorn each needs, we will divide their remaining calorie needs by 200 calories per serving.
Hiroshi still needs 2000 calories, so he needs 2000 / 200 = 10 servings of popcorn.
The bag has 6 servings per 300 grams, so each serving has 300 / 6 = 50 grams.
Hiroshi needs 10 servings * 50 grams/serving = 500 grams.

Tara still needs 1000 calories, so she needs 1000 / 200 = 5 servings of popcorn.
Tara needs 5 servings * 50 grams/serving = 250 grams.

To determine how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara, we will subtract the amount Tara needs from the amount Hiroshi needs.
Hiroshi needs 500 grams, and Tara needs 250 grams.
So, Hiroshi needs 500 - 250 = 250 grams more.

How many potted plants will Daphne remain with?",335.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of potted plants Daphne already has**

Daphne has 56 window ledges, and each ledge has 8 potted plants. To find the total number of potted plants she already has, we multiply the number of ledges by the number of plants per ledge:

56 ledges × 8 plants/ledge = 448 plants

**Step 2: Calculate the number of new potted plants Daphne received**

Daphne received 23 new potted plants from the plant nursery two days ago.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of new potted plants Daphne purchased**

Daphne purchased 200 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount. To find the number of plants she actually purchased, we divide the original price by 2:

200 plants × 0.5 (50% discount) = 100 plants

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of potted plants Daphne has now**

We add the number of plants Daphne already had, the number of plants she received, and the number of plants she purchased:

448 plants (already had) + 23 plants (received) + 100 plants (purchased) = 571 plants

First, let's find the speed of the fog bank in miles per minute. It covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, so its speed is 4 miles / 60 minutes = 1/15 miles per minute.

Now, the city is 80 miles across, so at the original speed, it would take 80 miles / (1/15 miles/minute) = 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes to cover the entire city.

However, the speed of the fog bank will be halved after 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. So, for the last half, the speed will be 1/15 * 1/2 = 1/30 miles per minute.

We want to find the time it takes to cover 1/4 of the city. Since the city is 80 miles across, 1/4 of it is 80 * 1/4 = 20 miles.

To cover the first half of the city (20 miles) at the original speed (1/15 miles/minute), it will take 20 / (1/15) = 20 * 15 = 300 minutes.

The second half of the city is also 20 miles, but we need to calculate how long it will take to cover it at the halved speed (1/30 miles/minute). It will take 20 / (1/30) = 20 * 30 = 600 minutes.

Since these times are for two separate halves, we need to find the time it takes to cover the first half at the original speed plus the time it takes to cover the second half at the halved speed.

x = 4800 / 4
x = 1200

So, it takes 1200 minutes to cover the entire city.

Santiago watched TV for a total of 20 hours.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, he watched 4-hour episodes each night, so he watched 2 x 4 = 8 hours of TV on those two nights.

On Thursday, he watched a 15-minute show. We need to convert this to hours to make it easier to work with. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 minutes is equal to 15/60 = 0.25 hours.

On Friday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. We need to convert the 45-minute show to hours. 45 minutes is equal to 45/60 = 0.75 hours. So, he watched a total of 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours of TV on Friday.

On Saturday, he watched three 2-hour episodes, so he watched 3 x 2 = 6 hours of TV.

On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes. We need to convert this to hours. 15 minutes is equal to 0.25 hours, so he watched 3 x 0.25 = 0.75 hours of TV on Sunday.

Now, let's add up the hours of TV he watched on each day:

Tuesday and Wednesday: 8 hours
Thursday: 0.25 hours
Friday: 3.75 hours
Saturday: 6 hours
Sunday: 0.75 hours

Total hours of TV watched: 8 + 0.25 + 3.75 + 6 + 0.75 = 19 hours

However, we know that Santiago watched a total of 20 hours of TV. This means that the 15-minute show he watched on Thursday must have been part of the remaining 1 hour of TV.

Let's convert the 15-minute show to hours: 15 minutes is equal to 0.25 hours.

Since he watched 0.25 hours of TV on Thursday, and we know that he watched a total of 1 hour of TV on Thursday, we can set up an equation:

0.25 + x = 1

Where x is the number of 15-minute episodes he watched on Thursday.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 1 - 0.25
x = 0.75

Since each episode is 15 minutes, we can convert this to the number of episodes:

A: Let's think step by step.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, he watched 4-hour episodes each night, so he watched 8 hours on those two nights.

On Friday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute episode. We need to convert the 45-minute episode to hours to make it easier to add. 45 minutes is 0.75 hours (45 minutes / 60 = 0.75).

So, the total hours watched on Friday is 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.

On Saturday, he watched three 2-hour episodes, so the total hours watched on Saturday is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, he watched 8 hours.
On Thursday, we need to find out, but we know the total hours is 20.
On Friday, he watched 3.75 hours.
On Saturday, he watched 6 hours.

Let's add the hours he watched on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday: 8 + 3.75 + 6 = 17.75 hours.

So, the hours he watched on Thursday is 20 - 17.75 = 2.25 hours.

On Thursday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. We need to find out how many 15-minute episodes. Let's convert the 2.25 hours to minutes: 2.25 hours * 60 = 135 minutes.

She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, and uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

Step 1: Determine the ratio of sugar to water
The ratio of sugar to water is given as 54:27. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 27. This gives us a simplified ratio of 2:1.

Step 2: Determine the amount of water used
Since the ratio of sugar to water is 2:1, for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, 1 cup of water is used. Let's say the number of teaspoons of sugar used is x. Then, the number of cups of water used is x/2.

Step 3: Determine the amount of milk used
Nia uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water. Since the number of cups of water used is x/2, the number of tablespoons of milk used is 8(x/2)/8 = x/2.

Step 4: Determine the amount of heavy cream used
Nia uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. Since the number of teaspoons of sugar used is x, the number of tablespoons of heavy cream used is 2x.

Step 5: Set up an equation to represent the total amount of ingredients used
The total amount of ingredients used is 240. This includes the teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 2x = 240

Combine like terms:

4.5x = 240

Step 6: Solve for x
Divide both sides of the equation by 4.5:

x = 240/4.5
x = 53.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a teaspoon of sugar, we can round x to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the exact amount of sugar used, so we will leave the answer as a decimal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{53.33}$",53.33,0,"I'll follow the format you provided to solve the problem step by step.

Let's think step by step.

The ratio of sugar to water is 54:27, which simplifies to 6:3 or 2:1. This means that for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, Nia uses 1 cup of water.

Since Nia used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk, we can start by finding the number of cups of water she used. 

The ratio of sugar to water is 2:1, so for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, Nia uses 1 cup of water. To find the number of cups of water, we can divide the total number of teaspoons of sugar by 2.

240 teaspoons of sugar / 2 = 120 cups of water

Now, let's consider the ratio of milk to water. Nia uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water. This means that for every 1 cup of water, she uses 1 tablespoon of milk. Since she used 120 cups of water, she used 120 tablespoons of milk.

Next, let's consider the ratio of heavy cream to sugar. Nia uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. Since she used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, she used 240 * 2 = 480 tablespoons of heavy cream.

Now, we can add up the total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk that Nia used. However, we are only interested in the number of teaspoons of sugar she used.

We already know that Nia used 240 teaspoons of sugar. We don't need to add anything else to this number.

She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of cups of water used. Since the ratio of sugar to water is 54:27, we can let the number of cups of water be 27x and the number of teaspoons of sugar be 54x.

We are also given that 8 tablespoons of milk are used for every 8 cups of water, so the number of tablespoons of milk used is 27x/8.

Additionally, 2 tablespoons of heavy cream are used for every teaspoon of sugar, so the number of tablespoons of heavy cream used is 54x/2 = 27x.

We are told that a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk were used. We can set up an equation based on this information:

27x + 27x/8 + 27x + 54x = 240

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate the fraction:

216x + 27x + 216x + 432x = 1920

Combine like terms:

810x = 1920

Divide both sides by 810:

x = 2.37

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar used:

Number of teaspoons of sugar = 54x
= 54(2.37)
= 127.58

However, we are given that the total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk used is 240. Since we have already found the value of x, we can check if the total is indeed 240:

27x + 27x/8 + 27x + 54x = 27(2.37) + 27(2.37)/8 + 27(2.37) + 54(2.37)
= 63.89 + 8.07 + 63.89 + 127.58
= 262.43

This is not equal to 240, which means our initial assumption that the total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk used is 240 is incorrect.

However, we can still find the number of teaspoons of sugar used by using the ratio of sugar to water. We know that the ratio of sugar to water is 54:27, so the number of teaspoons of sugar used is 54/27 = 2 times the number of cups of water used.

Since we are given that the total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk used is 240, we can set up an equation based on this information:

27x + 27x/8 + 27x + 54x = 240

We can simplify the equation and solve for x:

810x = 1920

x = 2.37

However, we are given that the total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk used is 240. Since we have already found the value of x, we can check if the total is indeed 240:

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct,"Aisha was preparing for a lunch party at her house, where she intended to serve stuffed peppers. She noticed that she was out of plastic forks, so she bought a new package of forks. Later, her husband also bought a package of 8 new forks and gave them to Aisha. While Aisha was making the stuffed peppers, she used sixteen of the forks to sample her stuffed peppers, then threw away 6 defective forks. The guests also brought 2 packs of forks, each having 6 inside them. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 32 forks. How many forks were in the package that Aisha bought?",34.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Aisha's husband bought a package of 8 new forks and gave them to Aisha.
2. Aisha used 16 forks to sample her stuffed peppers.
3. Aisha threw away 6 defective forks.
4. The guests brought 2 packs of forks, each having 6 inside them, so they brought a total of 2 x 6 = 12 forks.
5. Aisha had a total of 32 forks when she went to set the table.

Now, let's add up the forks that Aisha had at the end:

32 (total forks) = 8 (Aisha's husband's forks) + 16 (forks used by Aisha) + 12 (forks brought by guests) + x (forks in the package Aisha bought)

Aisha starts with an unknown number of forks from the package she bought.
Her husband gives her 8 more forks.
She uses 16 forks to sample the stuffed peppers.

So, the total number of forks is 32.

Now, let's subtract the forks that were not in the package Aisha bought:
Her husband gave her 8 forks.
The guests brought 12 forks.
So, the total number of forks that were not in the package Aisha bought is 8 + 12 = 20.

Now, let's subtract the forks that were not in the package Aisha bought from the total number of forks:
32 (total forks) - 20 (forks not in Aisha's package) = 12.

So, the number of forks in the package that Aisha bought is 12.

She noticed that she was out of plastic forks, so she bought a new package of forks. Later, her husband also bought a package of 8 new forks and gave them to Aisha. While Aisha was making the stuffed peppers, she used sixteen of the forks to sample her stuffed peppers, then threw away 6 defective forks. The guests also brought 2 packs of forks, each having 6 inside them. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 32 forks. How many forks were in the package that Aisha bought?

A: Let's think step by step.

Aisha starts with some forks.
Her husband gives her 8 forks.
She uses 16 forks and throws away 6.
The guests bring 2 packs of forks, each having 6 inside them, so she gets 12 forks from them.
So, the total number of forks she has is 32.

We know that x + 8 - 16 + 12 = 32.

Simplifying the equation, we get x - 16 + 12 = 32.

Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get x - 4 = 32.

Adding 4 to both sides, we get x = 36.

In addition, Ravi owns a 13-square yard apricot field that produces 12 apricots per square yard. The apricots can be harvested every 4 months. In the span of two years, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?",1764.0,"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, we need to find out how many bananas Ravi can harvest from his banana field in two years.

Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field. Since there are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard, we need to find out how many bananas per square yard. 

Four-fifths of a square yard = 4/5 * 1 square yard = 4/5 square yard
Since 1 square yard = 4/5 square yard * x bananas, 
36 bananas / (4/5) = x
x = 36 / (4/5) = 45 bananas per 1 square yard.

So, Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field, which can produce 45 bananas per square yard. 

In two years, there are 24 months. Since Ravi can harvest bananas every 4 months, there are 24 / 4 = 6 harvests in two years.
The total number of bananas Ravi can harvest from his banana field in two years is 10 * 45 * 6 = 2700 bananas.

Next, we need to find out how many apricots Ravi can harvest from his apricot field in two years.

Ravi has a 13-square yard apricot field that produces 12 apricots per square yard. So, the total number of apricots per harvest is 13 * 12 = 156.

Since Ravi can harvest apricots every 4 months, there are 6 harvests in two years. The total number of apricots Ravi can harvest from his apricot field in two years is 156 * 6 = 936.

Now, to find the difference between the number of bananas and apricots harvested in two years, we subtract the number of apricots from the number of bananas:
2700 (bananas) - 936 (apricots) = 1764.

So, Ravi harvests 1764 more bananas than apricots in two years.",1764.0,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field. 

There are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard. 
To find the number of bananas per square yard, we need to divide 36 by 4/5. 
So, the number of bananas per square yard is 36 / (4/5) = 36 * (5/4) = 45 bananas per square yard.

Ravi can harvest his bananas every 4 months. 
In 2 years, there are 2 * 12 = 24 periods of 4 months. 
So, the total number of bananas harvested from the banana field is 10 * 45 * 24 = 10800 bananas.

Ravi owns a 13-square yard apricot field that produces 12 apricots per square yard. 
The apricots can be harvested every 4 months. 
In 2 years, there are 2 * 12 = 24 periods of 4 months. 
So, the total number of apricots harvested from the apricot field is 13 * 12 * 24 = 3744 apricots.

The question asks how many more bananas Ravi harvests than apricots in the span of two years. 
So, we need to subtract the number of apricots from the number of bananas. 
The difference is 10800 - 3744 = 7056.

The answer is 7056.",7056.0,0,"Let's break down the original problem step by step.

Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field. There are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard. 

Let's find the total number of bananas Ravi has in his banana field.
First, find four-fifths of a square yard. Since there are 5 parts to a whole, four-fifths is 4/5.
So, four-fifths of a square yard is (4/5) * 1 = 4/5 square yards.
Now, the number of bananas per square yard is 36, so the number of bananas per 4/5 of a square yard is 36 * (4/5) = 28.8 bananas.

Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field. So, the total number of bananas is 10 * 28.8 = 288 bananas.

Now, let's find the number of bananas Ravi harvests in 2 years. Since Ravi can harvest bananas every 4 months, he harvests bananas two times a year.
So, the total number of bananas Ravi harvests in 2 years is 288 * 2 = 576 bananas.

Ravi also has a 13-square yard apricot field that produces 12 apricots per square yard.
So, the total number of apricots is 13 * 12 = 156 apricots.
Since Ravi can harvest apricots every 4 months, he harvests apricots two times a year.
So, the total number of apricots Ravi harvests in 2 years is 156 * 2 = 312 apricots.

Now, let's find the difference between the number of bananas and apricots Ravi harvests in 2 years.
So, the difference is 576 - 312 = 264.

What is the least amount Arjun can spend on everything?",212.0,"To find the least amount Arjun can spend, we need to calculate the cost of the items first. 

1. Cost of folders: 
   12 folders * $4.75 = $57

2. Cost of erasers: 
   8 erasers * $14.5 = $116

3. Cost of bond paper: 
   $11

4. Cost of pencils: 
   7 pencils * $8 = $56

So, the total cost of the items is:
$57 + $116 + $11 + $56 = $240

Now, let's calculate the cost with a 20% discount (for the member) and a 5% discount (for the non-member).

For the member:
   Discount on total cost = 20% of $240
   Discount = 0.2 * $240 = $48
   Final cost for the member = $240 - $48 = $192

For the non-member:
   Discount on total cost = 5% of $240
   Discount = 0.05 * $240 = $12
   Final cost for the non-member = $240 - $12 = $228

To become a member, Arjun needs to pay a one-time $20 fee. So, the total cost for the member will be:
$192 + $20 = $212

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Arjun bought:

Now, let's consider the two options:

Option 1: Arjun becomes a member and gets a 20% discount on all purchases.

The total cost with the discount is $240 - (20% of $240) = $240 - $48 = $192.

Option 2: Arjun does not become a member and gets a 5% discount on all purchases.

The total cost with the discount is $240 - (5% of $240) = $240 - $12 = $228.

What is the least amount Arjun can spend on everything?

Let's think step by step:

Arjun starts by buying the folders.
The cost of folders is $4.75 * 12 = $57.

He also buys erasers.
The cost of erasers is $14.50 * 8 = $116.

Then, he buys a ream of bond paper for $11.

After that, he buys 7 pencils, each costing $8.
The cost of pencils is $8 * 7 = $56.

So, the total cost before any discount is $57 + $116 + $11 + $56 = $240.

Now, let's consider the membership options.
If Arjun becomes a member, he gets a 20% discount on all purchases.
The discount on the total purchase would be 20% of $240 = 0.20 * $240 = $48.

So, the total amount Arjun would pay if he becomes a member is $240 - $48 = $192.

If Arjun doesn't become a member, he gets a 5% discount on all purchases.
The discount on the total purchase would be 5% of $240 = 0.05 * $240 = $12.

So, the total amount Arjun would pay if he doesn't become a member is $240 - $12 = $228.

Since we want the least amount Arjun can spend, the answer is $192.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row, than that he rolls four even numbers in a row?",50.0,"## Step 1: Determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a twenty-sided die.
There are 15 numbers greater than 5 on a twenty-sided die (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20), so the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is 15/20 = 3/4.

## Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row.
To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row, we need to multiply the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on the first roll by the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on the second roll. This is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

## Step 3: Determine the probability of rolling an even number on a twenty-sided die.
There are 10 even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20) on a twenty-sided die, so the probability of rolling an even number is 10/20 = 1/2.

## Step 4: Calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row.
To find the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row, we need to multiply the probability of rolling an even number on each of the four rolls. This is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16.

## Step 5: Find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row and rolling four even numbers in a row.
The difference in probability is 9/16 - 1/16 = 8/16 = 1/2.

## Step 6: Convert the difference in probability to a percentage.
To convert the difference in probability to a percentage, we need to divide the difference by the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row and multiply by 100. This is (1/2) / (1/16) * 100 = 50%.

## Step 7: Express the difference as a percentage point.
Since the question asks for the difference in percentage points, we need to express the result as a percentage point, which is the same as the percentage.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$",50.0,1,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row, we need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a 20-sided die, and then square it.

A 20-sided die has 10 numbers greater than 5 (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20).

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is 15/20 = 3/4.

To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row, we square this probability: (3/4)^2 = 9/16.

Now, let's find the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row. A 20-sided die has 10 even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20).

So, the probability of rolling an even number is 10/20 = 1/2.

To find the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row, we raise this probability to the power of 4: (1/2)^4 = 1/16.

Now, we need to find the difference in percentage points between the two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is 9/16, and the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is 1/16.

To find the difference, we subtract the smaller probability from the larger one: 9/16 - 1/16 = 8/16 = 1/2.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/2) * 100 = 50%.

So, the difference in percentage points is 50%.

Mia then found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. In addition, she saw 24 wasps, and 9 bees. What percentage of animals in the plot were rabbits?",20.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mia found 2/3 as many beetles as bees. Let's say the number of bees is x. Then, the number of beetles is 2/3x.

2. Mia found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. This means the number of rabbits is 26/2 = 13.

3. In addition, she saw 24 wasps and 9 bees. So, the total number of bees and wasps is 24 + 9 = 33.

4. Since the number of beetles is 2/3x, and the number of bees is x, we can set up an equation to find the total number of insects (bees and beetles):

2/3x + x = 33

Combine like terms:

5/3x = 33

Multiply both sides by 3/5:

x = 33 * 3/5
x = 19.8

So, the number of bees is approximately 19.8, and the number of beetles is 2/3 * 19.8 = 13.2.

5. Now, let's find the total number of animals in the plot. We know the number of rabbits (13), the number of bees and wasps (33), and the number of beetles (13.2). We can add these numbers together to get the total number of animals:

13 + 33 + 13.2 = 59.2

6. Finally, let's find the percentage of animals that are rabbits. We can divide the number of rabbits by the total number of animals and multiply by 100:

(13 / 59.2) * 100 ≈ 21.9%

So, approximately 21.9% of the animals in the plot were rabbits.",21.9,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Mia found 2/3 as many beetles as bees in the plot. Let's assume the number of bees is x. Then, the number of beetles is 2/3 * x.

Mia also found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. This means the number of rabbits is 26 / 2 = 13.

In addition, she saw 24 wasps and 9 bees. So, the total number of bees is 9 + x.

We know that the number of beetles is 2/3 * x. Since the number of beetles is equal to the number of bees, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * x = 9 + x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3 to get:

2x = 27 + 3x

Subtracting 3x from both sides gives:

-x = 27

Multiplying both sides by -1 gives:

x = -27

However, x cannot be negative because it represents the number of bees. This means our initial assumption that the number of bees is x is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that Mia found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. This means the number of rabbits is 13.

We also know that Mia saw 24 wasps and 9 bees. So, the total number of bees and wasps is 24 + 9 = 33.

Since the total number of animals in the plot is the sum of the number of rabbits, bees, wasps, and beetles, we can set up the equation:

Number of rabbits + Number of bees + Number of wasps + Number of beetles = Total number of animals

We know that the number of rabbits is 13, the number of bees is 9, and the number of wasps is 24. We also know that the number of beetles is 2/3 as many as the number of bees.

Let's assume the number of bees is x. Then, the number of beetles is 2/3 * x.

The total number of animals is the sum of the number of rabbits, bees, wasps, and beetles:

13 + x + 24 + 2/3 * x = Total number of animals

We are also given that the total number of animals is not explicitly stated, but we can infer that it is the sum of all the animals Mia found.

However, we can still find the percentage of animals that are rabbits. We know that the number of rabbits is 13, and the total number of animals is the sum of the number of rabbits, bees, wasps, and beetles.

Let's assume the total number of animals is y. Then, the percentage of animals that are rabbits is:

(13 / y) * 100

However, we still need to find the total number of animals. We can do this by finding the total number of bees and wasps, and then adding the number of rabbits and beetles.

We know that the number of bees is 9, and the number of wasps is 24. We also know that the number of beetles is 2/3 as many as the number of bees.

Let's assume the number of bees is x. Then, the number of beetles is 2/3 * x.

The total number of bees and wasps is 9 + 24 = 33.

We also know that the number of beetles is 2/3 * x. Since the number of beetles is equal to the number of bees, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * x = 9

Multiplying both sides by 3 gives:

2x = 27

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

x = 13.5

However, x cannot be a fraction because it represents the number of bees. This means our initial assumption that the number of bees is x is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that Mia found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. This means the number of rabbits is 13.

We also know that Mia saw 24 wasps and 9 bees. So, the total number of bees and wasps is 24 + 9 = 33.

Since the total number of animals in the plot is the sum of the number of rabbits, bees, wasps, and beetles, we can set up the equation:

Number of rabbits + Number of bees + Number of wasps + Number of beetles = Total number of animals

We know that the number of rabbits is 13, the number of bees is 9, and the number of wasps is 24. We also know that the number of beetles is 2/3 as many as the number of bees.

Let's assume the number of bees is x. Then, the number of beetles is 2/3 * x.

The total number of animals is the sum of the number of rabbits, bees, wasps, and beetles:

13 + x + 24 + 2/3 * x = Total number of animals

However, we can simplify the problem by noticing that the number of beetles is 2/3 as many as the number of bees. This means that the number of beetles is less than the number of bees.

Since the number of beetles is less than the number of bees, we can conclude that the number of beetles is less than 9.

Let's assume the number of beetles is y. Then, the number of bees is 2/3 * y.

The total number of animals is the sum of the number of rabbits, bees, wasps, and beetles:

Mia found 2/3 as many beetles as bees in the plot. Let's start by finding the number of bees and beetles.

Let's assume the number of bees is x. Then, the number of beetles is 2/3x.

Mia saw 9 bees, so x = 9.

The number of beetles is 2/3x = 2/3(9) = 6.

Mia found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. So, the number of rabbits is 26/2 = 13.

She also saw 24 wasps and 9 bees. The total number of non-rabbits is 24 + 9 = 33.

The total number of animals in the plot is the sum of the number of rabbits, beetles, wasps, and bees: 13 + 6 + 33 + 9 = 61.

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?",11000.0,"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the selling price after the discount, brokerage fee, and transfer fee. 

1. Calculate the selling price after the discount: 
Discount = 25% of $400,000
25% of $400,000 = 0.25 * $400,000 = $100,000
So, the selling price after the discount is: $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000

2. Calculate the brokerage fee:
Brokerage fee = 5% of $300,000
5% of $300,000 = 0.05 * $300,000 = $15,000

3. Calculate the transfer fee:
Transfer fee = 12% of $300,000
12% of $300,000 = 0.12 * $300,000 = $36,000

4. Calculate the total cost:
Total cost = Selling price after discount + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
Total cost = $300,000 + $15,000 + $36,000
Total cost = $351,000

5. Find the difference between the total cost and Mrs. Lee's budget: 
Difference = Total cost - Mrs. Lee's budget
Difference = $351,000 - $340,000
Difference = $11,000

So, the total cost will be $11,000 more than Mrs. Lee's budget of $340,000.",340000.0,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Mrs. Lee's budget is $340,000.

The selling price of the property is $400,000.

However, Mrs. Lee can get a 25% discount on the selling price.

So, the discounted price is $400,000 - (25% of $400,000) = $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is $400,000.

So, the brokerage fee is $400,000 x 5% = $400,000 x 0.05 = $20,000.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is $400,000.

So, the transfer fee is $400,000 x 12% = $400,000 x 0.12 = $48,000.

The total cost is the discounted price plus the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

So, the total cost is $300,000 + $20,000 + $48,000 = $368,000.

The difference between the total cost and Mrs. Lee's budget is $368,000 - $340,000 = $28,000.

If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?

Let's think step by step.

The selling price of the property is $400000.
Mrs. Lee gets a 25% discount on the selling price, so the price she has to pay is 400000 - (400000 * 0.25) = 400000 - 100000 = 300000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, so the brokerage fee is 400000 * 0.05 = 20000.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, so the transfer fee is 400000 * 0.12 = 48000.

The total cost will be the price Mrs. Lee pays plus the brokerage fee and the transfer fee: 300000 + 20000 + 48000 = 368000.

The stocks gained 10% each year for two years. How much were Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years?",80465.0,"To find Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the legal fees:
   The legal fees are 2% of the selling price, which is $550000. 
   So, legal fees = 2% of $550000 = 0.02 * $550000 = $11000.

2. Calculate the realtor fee:
   The realtor fee is 5% of the selling price, which is $550000. 
   So, realtor fee = 5% of $550000 = 0.05 * $550000 = $27500.

3. Calculate the total fees:
   Total fees = legal fees + realtor fee = $11000 + $27500 = $38500.

4. Calculate the remaining amount after paying fees:
   Remaining amount = selling price - total fees = $550000 - $38500 = $511500.

5. Calculate the remaining amount after paying the loan:
   Remaining amount = remaining amount - loan amount = $511500 - $440000 = $71700.

6. Calculate the remaining amount after paying closing costs:
   Remaining amount = remaining amount - closing costs = $71700 - $5000 = $66700.

7. Calculate the amount after two years:
   The stocks gained 10% each year for two years. 
   So, the gain after two years = 1.1 * 1.1 = 1.21.

Dr. Brown sold his villa for $550,000.

He paid the legal fees that amounted to 2% of the selling price.
2% of $550,000 is 0.02 * $550,000 = $11,000.
So, the amount he paid for legal fees is $11,000.

He also paid a realtor fee that is 5% of the selling price.
5% of $550,000 is 0.05 * $550,000 = $27,500.
So, the amount he paid for the realtor fee is $27,500.

He also paid $44,000 for the remaining loan amount on the villa, and $5,000 for closing costs.
So, the total amount he paid is $11,000 + $27,500 + $44,000 + $5,000 = $87,500.

The net proceeds from selling the villa is the selling price minus the total amount he paid.
So, the net proceeds is $550,000 - $87,500 = $462,500.

Dr. Brown used the net proceeds to invest in stocks.
The stocks gained 10% each year for two years.
The gain for the first year is 10% of $462,500, which is 0.10 * $462,500 = $46,250.
The gain for the second year is also 10% of $462,500, which is 0.10 * $462,500 = $46,250.
The total gain is $46,250 + $46,250 = $92,500.

The net proceeds after two years is the initial amount plus the total gain.

Q: Mrs. Lee is looking for a new townhouse that will not go beyond her $340000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $400000.

If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?

A: Let's think step by step.

The selling price of the property is $400000.
Mrs. Lee gets a 25% discount on the selling price, so the price she has to pay is 400000 - (400000 * 0.25) = 400000 - 100000 = 300000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, so the brokerage fee is 400000 * 0.05 = 20000.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, so the transfer fee is 400000 * 0.12 = 48000.

The total cost will be the price Mrs. Lee pays plus the brokerage fee and the transfer fee: 300000 + 20000 + 48000 = 368000.

The total number of kids in the park is 16 + 4 = 20.
To find the percentage of girls, we need to divide the number of girls by the total number of kids and multiply by 100.
So, the percentage of girls is (16 / 20) * 100 = 80%.

She also bought a mixed bag of sand dollars for ₺11.0 and 12 postcards that were ₺21.0 each. Priya then donated ₺5 at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Priya have left?",492.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the fudge**

Priya bought 21 kgs of fudge. The first 15 kgs cost ₺22 per kg, so the cost of the first 15 kgs is:
15 kgs x ₺22 per kg = ₺330

The remaining 6 kgs (21 kgs - 15 kgs) are 1/4 off. To find the cost of the remaining 6 kgs, we need to calculate the discount:
1/4 of ₺22 per kg = ₺5.50 per kg (since 1/4 of ₺22 is ₺5.50)

So, the cost of the remaining 6 kgs is:
6 kgs x ₺22 per kg - ₺5.50 per kg = ₺132 - ₺33 = ₺99

The total cost of the fudge is:
₺330 + ₺99 = ₺429

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the sand dollars and postcards**

Priya bought a mixed bag of sand dollars for ₺11.0 and 12 postcards for ₺21.0 each. The total cost of the postcards is:
12 postcards x ₺21.0 per postcard = ₺252

The total cost of the sand dollars and postcards is:
₺11.0 + ₺252 = ₺263

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of all items**

The total cost of all items is the sum of the cost of the fudge, sand dollars, and postcards:
₺429 + ₺263 = ₺692

**Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the initial amount**

Priya started with ₺1200. After buying all the items, she has:
₺1200 - ₺692 = ₺508

**Step 5: Subtract the donation**

Priya donated ₺5 at a charity stand. So, we need to subtract this amount from the remaining amount:
₺508 - ₺5 = ₺503

Therefore, Priya has ₺503 left.",503.0,0,"I'll follow the format you provided to solve the problem step by step.

She scooped up 21 kgs. She also bought a mixed bag of sand dollars for ₺11.0 and 12 postcards that were ₺21.0 each. Priya then donated ₺5 at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Priya have left?

A: Let's think step by step.

Priya starts with ₺1200.

She buys 15 kgs of fudge at ₺22 per kg, which costs 15 * 22 = ₺330.
She also buys 4 kgs of fudge at 1/4 off, which costs 4 * (22 * 0.25) = ₺22.

She also gets 4 kgs of fudge at 1/4 off. The original price for 4 kgs would be 4 * ₺22 = ₺88. Since it's 1/4 off, she pays ₺88 * 3/4 = ₺66 for the 4 kgs.

The total cost for the fudge is ₺330 + ₺66 = ₺396.

She also buys a mixed bag of sand dollars for ₺11.0 and 12 postcards for ₺21.0 each. The total cost for the postcards is 12 * ₺21 = ₺252.

Yuki has 54 dogs, each having 13 puppies with spots. After a visit to the vet, Jamal discovered that half of his unspotted puppies actually have spots that were not visible before. What percentage of all the puppies have spots?",90.0,"Let's break down the information:

1. Jamal's dog:
   - Total puppies: 131
   - Puppies with spots: 23
   - Initially, we are not given the number of unspotted puppies, but we know that half of them have spots. Let's call the number of unspotted puppies 'x'. So, the number of spotted puppies that were initially not visible is x/2.

2. Gabriel's dog:
   - Total puppies: 47
   - Puppies with spots: 13
   No additional information is given about unspotted puppies.

3. Yuki:
   - Total dogs: 54 (Note: This is not the total number of puppies. This is the number of dogs. Each dog has 13 puppies with spots.)
   - Total puppies with spots from Yuki: 54 * 13 = 702

Now, let's calculate the total number of puppies:
- Jamal's puppies: 131
- Gabriel's puppies: 47
- Yuki's puppies: Since each of her 54 dogs has 13 puppies, she has 54 * 13 = 702 puppies.
- Total puppies: 131 + 47 + 702 = 880

Now, we know that half of Jamal's unspotted puppies have spots. So, the total spotted puppies are:
- Jamal's spotted puppies: 23
- Spotted puppies from Yuki: 702
- Spotted puppies that were initially not visible in Jamal's puppies: x/2
- Total spotted puppies: 23 + 702 + (x/2)

We also know that x is the number of unspotted puppies in Jamal's dog. Since half of them have spots that were not visible before, the other half is x - (x/2) = x/2. So, the total number of puppies without spots is:
- Total puppies without spots: 131 - x/2

Now, the total number of puppies is 880, and the total number of puppies with spots is 23 + 702 + (x/2). So, we can set up the following equation:

(23 + 702 + (x/2)) / 880 = (percentage of puppies with spots)/100

Since we want the percentage of puppies with spots, we'll multiply the equation by 100 to eliminate the fraction. 

(23 + 702 + (x/2)) = ( (percentage of puppies with spots) * 880)/100

Combine like terms:

725 + (x/2) = ((percentage of puppies with spots) * 880)/100

We know that x is the number of unspotted puppies. We can calculate it using the information about Jamal's dog.

Before the vet visit, the number of unspotted puppies was x, and the number of spotted puppies was 23. After the vet visit, half of the unspotted puppies have spots. So, the number of spotted puppies after the vet visit is 23 + (x/2). The total number of puppies is 131. 

The total number of puppies without spots after the vet visit is x - (x/2) = x/2.

So, the total number of puppies with spots after the vet visit is 23 + (x/2). Also, the total number of puppies after the vet visit is 131.

We know that the total number of puppies with spots is 23 + 702 + (x/2). 

Since 23 + (x/2) is the number of puppies with spots after the vet visit, and we know that the total number of puppies is 880, we can set up the following equation:

23 + 702 + (x/2) = (percentage of puppies with spots) * 880/100

Combine like terms:

725 + (x/2) = (percentage of puppies with spots) * 880/100

We also know that (x/2) is the number of puppies that Jamal's dog had after the vet visit. We can write an equation using the information about Jamal's dog:

131 = (percentage of puppies without spots after the vet visit) * 131
131 = (percentage of puppies without spots) * 131

The percentage of puppies without spots after the vet visit is 25, because (x/2) is the number of puppies that Jamal's dog had after the vet visit. So, 25 is the percentage of puppies without spots after the vet visit.

Now, let's calculate the total number of puppies without spots. 

Number of puppies without spots after the vet visit: 25% of 131 is (25/100) * 131 = 32.75.

Since 131 is the total number of puppies before the vet visit, we can set up the equation:

32.75 = x/2

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 2 * 32.75
x = 65.5

Now, we can substitute the value of x in the equation we set up earlier:

725 + (x/2) = (percentage of puppies with spots) * 880/100

Substitute x = 65.5:

725 + (65.5/2) = (percentage of puppies with spots) * 880/100

Combine like terms:

725 + 32.75 = (percentage of puppies with spots) * 880/100

Combine like terms:

757.75 = (percentage of puppies with spots) * 880/100

Now, multiply both sides of the equation by 100/880:

757.75 * 100/880 = (percentage of puppies with spots)

Now, simplify the equation:

(757.75 * 100) / 880 = (percentage of puppies with spots)

75775 / 880 = (percentage of puppies with spots)

87.12% of the puppies have spots.",87.12,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, let's find the total number of puppies from Jamal and Gabriel. 
Jamal has 131 puppies.
Gabriel has 47 puppies.
So, the total number of puppies is 131 + 47 = 178.

Next, let's find the total number of puppies from Yuki. 
We are not told the total number of puppies from Yuki, only the number of puppies with spots. Since each of Yuki's dogs has 13 puppies with spots, we need to know the total number of Yuki's dogs to find the total number of puppies with spots from Yuki. However, the problem states ""Yuki has 54 dogs, each having 13 puppies with spots."" This implies that Yuki has 54 dogs with 13 puppies each, but the total number of puppies from these 54 dogs is not 54 * 13, because 54 is the number of dogs, not puppies. The total number of puppies from Yuki is not needed because we are asked for the percentage of puppies with spots. 

Now, let's find the total number of puppies with spots from Yuki.
Yuki's dogs have 54 * 13 = 702 puppies in total, but we need to know the number of puppies with spots from Yuki. The problem does not give the total number of puppies from Yuki, only the number of puppies with spots from Yuki's 54 dogs. The problem statement is unclear about the number of puppies per dog, so we have to assume it means that 54 is actually the number of puppies, not the number of dogs. 

If that is the case, then Yuki has 54 puppies, each of Yuki's 54 puppies has 13 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots from Yuki is 54 * 13 = 702.

However, we are told that the 702 puppies with spots from Yuki is actually the number of puppies with spots per Yuki's dog. Since there are 54 puppies with spots from Yuki, and they have 13 puppies with spots, we can assume 54 is the total number of puppies from Yuki.

Since we are asked for the percentage of all puppies with spots, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. 
Jamal's puppies with spots = 23.
Gabriel's puppies with spots = 13.
Yuki's puppies with spots = 54.

However, the problem states that half of Jamal's unspotted puppies have spots. So we need to calculate the total number of spots in Jamal's puppies. Now we will assume that the number of puppies shown is the number of dogs. Given the number of dogs from Yuki is 54, we can safely assume that the number of puppies shown is the number of dogs for Jamal as well. 

Jamal's puppies = 131.
Number of spotted puppies = 23.
So, the number of unspotted puppies is 131 - 23 = 108.

Since half of his unspotted puppies actually have spots, we need to find half of 108. 
Half of 108 = 108 / 2 = 54.

So, the total number of puppies with spots from Jamal is 23 (initially spotted) + 54 (found to be spotted) = 77.

Now, let's find the total number of puppies with spots.
Total puppies with spots = 23 + 13 + 54 = 90.

Let's find the total number of puppies.
Jamal = 131
Gabriel = 47
Yuki = 54

Total number of puppies = 131 + 47 + 54 = 232.

Now, let's calculate the percentage of puppies with spots.
Percentage of puppies with spots = (total number of puppies with spots / total number of puppies) * 100.
Percentage of puppies with spots = (90 / 232) * 100.

Now, let's calculate the percentage.
Percentage of puppies with spots = (90 / 232) * 100 = 38.79%

After a visit to the vet, Jamal discovered that half of his unspotted puppies actually have spots that were not visible before. What percentage of all the puppies have spots?

A: Let's think step by step.

Jamal's dog has 131 puppies.
Of these, 23 have spots.
So, the number of puppies without spots is 131 - 23 = 108.
Jamal's vet discovers that half of these unspotted puppies have spots. 
Half of 108 is 108 / 2 = 54, so these puppies have spots.
Now, the total number of puppies with spots is 23 (initially spotted) + 54 (previously unspotted) = 77.
Gabriel's dog has 47 puppies, 13 of which have spots.
Yuki has 54 dogs, each having 13 puppies with spots.
So, the total number of puppies with spots from Yuki is 54 * 13 = 702.
The total number of puppies with spots is 77 (Jamal's) + 13 (Gabriel's) + 702 (Yuki's) = 792.
The total number of puppies is 131 (Jamal's) + 47 (Gabriel's) + 54 * 13 (Yuki's) = 131 + 47 + 702 = 880.

3. Hay: 34 packs * 39 kg = 1326 kg
4. Corn: 20 sacks * 17 kg = 340 kg

Now, let's add all the weights together:
12 kg + 72 kg + 1326 kg + 340 kg + 43 kg + 27 kg + 100 kg = 1680 kg

Since the farmer has three trucks, each with a capacity of 160 kg, we need to divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck and then multiply the result by the number of trucks.

1680 kg / 160 kg = 10.5 trips (since we can't take a fraction of a trip)
The farmer has three trucks, so:
10.5 trips * 3 trucks = 31.5 trips (again, since we can't take a fraction of a trip, this is a problem).
The farmer will need to make 11 full trips with one truck and then make another trip with two trucks to deliver the remaining 80 kg (since 1680 - 160*10 = 80 kg) of goods.

Alternatively, since we can't use a fraction of a trip, we can calculate the total weight that can be delivered with 10 trips:
10 trips * 160 kg = 1600 kg

The farmer buys four 3-kg boxes of apples. 
So, the total weight of apples is 4 * 3 = 12 kgs.
He buys twelve 6-kg bags of cucumbers.
So, the total weight of cucumbers is 12 * 6 = 72 kgs.

Later, Uma saw another 10-foot shark with 6 remoras, each 8 inches long, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?",45.0,"To find the percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras on each shark and divide it by the length of the shark.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Shark 1:**

1. Calculate the total length of the remoras on Shark 1:
   - Each remora is 16 inches long.
   - There are 18 remoras.
   - Total length of remoras = 18 * 16 = 288 inches

2. Convert the length of Shark 1 to inches:
   - Shark 1 is 40 feet long.
   - 1 foot = 12 inches, so 40 feet = 40 * 12 = 480 inches

3. Calculate the percentage of Shark 1's body length covered by the remoras:
   - Percentage = (Total length of remoras / Length of Shark 1) * 100
   - Percentage = (288 / 480) * 100
   - Percentage ≈ 60%

**Remoras on Shark 1 swim away:**

1. Calculate the number of remoras that swam away:
   - 1/6 of the remoras swam away.
   - Number of remoras that swam away = 18 * (1/6) = 3

2. Calculate the new number of remoras on Shark 1:
   - New number of remoras = 18 - 3 = 15

3. Calculate the new total length of the remoras on Shark 1:
   - New total length of remoras = 15 * 16 = 240 inches

4. Calculate the new percentage of Shark 1's body length covered by the remoras:
   - New percentage = (New total length of remoras / Length of Shark 1) * 100
   - New percentage = (240 / 480) * 100
   - New percentage ≈ 50%

**Shark 2:**

1. Calculate the total length of the remoras on Shark 2:
   - Each remora is 8 inches long.
   - There are 6 remoras.
   - Total length of remoras = 6 * 8 = 48 inches

2. Convert the length of Shark 2 to inches:
   - Shark 2 is 10 feet long.
   - 10 feet = 10 * 12 = 120 inches

3. Calculate the percentage of Shark 2's body length covered by the remoras:
   - Percentage = (Total length of remoras / Length of Shark 2) * 100
   - Percentage = (48 / 120) * 100
   - Percentage ≈ 40%

Therefore, the percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras is approximately 60% for Shark 1, 50% for Shark 1 after some remoras swam away, and 40% for Shark 2.",2.0,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the 40-foot shark.

Each remora is 16 inches long, and there are 18 remoras. To find the total length of the remoras, we need to convert the length from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

16 inches = 16 / 12 = 1.33 feet (approximately)

Now, let's multiply the length of one remora by the number of remoras:

1.33 feet * 18 = 23.94 feet

So, the total length of the remoras attached to the 40-foot shark is approximately 23.94 feet.

Next, let's calculate the percentage of the 40-foot shark's body length covered by the remoras:

(23.94 / 40) * 100% ≈ 59.85%

Now, let's move on to the second shark. We need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the 10-foot shark.

Each remora is 8 inches long, and there are 6 remoras. To find the total length of the remoras, we need to convert the length from inches to feet:

8 inches = 8 / 12 = 0.67 feet

Now, let's multiply the length of one remora by the number of remoras:

0.67 feet * 6 = 4.02 feet

So, the total length of the remoras attached to the 10-foot shark is approximately 4.02 feet.

Next, let's calculate the percentage of the 10-foot shark's body length covered by the remoras:

(4.02 / 10) * 100% = 40.2%

Now, we need to find the average percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras. We can do this by taking the average of the two percentages:

Since 1 foot is 12 inches, the shark is 40 * 12 = 480 inches long.
So, the percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras is 288 / 480 = 0.6.

Then, 1/6 of the remoras swam away.
1/6 of 18 is 3, so 3 remoras swam away.
Now, there are 18 - 3 = 15 remoras left on the first shark.
The total length of the remoras left is 15 * 16 = 240 inches.

The percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras is 240 / 480 = 0.5.

Next, let's calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the second shark.
There are 6 remoras, each 8 inches long.
So, the total length of the remoras is 6 * 8 = 48 inches.

The second shark is 10 feet long. 
Since 1 foot is 12 inches, the shark is 10 * 12 = 120 inches long.
So, the percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras is 48 / 120 = 0.4.

Now, we need to find the average percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras.
The average is the sum of the percentages divided by the number of sharks.
So, the average percentage is (0.5 + 0.4) / 2 = 0.45.

To convert the decimal to a percentage, we multiply by 100.
So, the average percentage is 0.45 * 100 = 45.

1. Each table can hold three times the number of almonds as a bowl, so each table can hold 24 x 3 = 72 almonds.

2. Carlos has 3 tables, so the total number of almonds that the tables can hold is 3 x 72 = 216 almonds.

3. Carlos has 7 bowls, so the total number of almonds that the bowls can hold is 7 x 24 = 168 almonds.

4. The total number of almonds that the tables and bowls can hold is 216 + 168 = 384 almonds.

5. Carlos has 720 almonds, so he has 720 - 384 = 336 almonds left after filling the tables and bowls.

6. Unfortunately, 2 tables break, so the number of almonds that the tables can hold is reduced by 2 x 72 = 144 almonds.

7. The total number of almonds that the tables can hold is now 216 - 144 = 72 almonds.

8. The total number of almonds that the tables and bowls can hold is now 72 + 168 = 240 almonds.

9. Carlos has 336 almonds left, so he needs 336 - 240 = 96 almonds more space.

Carlos has 720 almonds.
Each table can hold three times as many almonds as a bowl, so each table can hold 3 * 24 = 72 almonds.
There are 3 tables, but 2 break, so he has 1 table left.
The remaining almonds that can be placed on the table is 72.
The number of almonds that can be placed on the bowls is 720 - 72 = 648.
Each bowl can hold 24 almonds.
So, the number of bowls needed to hold the remaining almonds is 648 / 24 = 27.
However, Carlos already has 7 bowls.
So, the number of additional bowls he needs is 27 - 7 = 20.
The answer is 20.",20.0,0,"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Carlos places almonds on bowls and tables. Each bowl can hold 24 almonds while each table can hold three times that, so each table can hold 3 * 24 = 72 almonds. Carlos has 720 almonds, 7 bowls, and 3 tables. Unfortunately, 2 tables break.

Let's think step by step.

Carlos starts with 3 tables and 7 bowls.
Each table can hold 72 almonds and each bowl can hold 24 almonds.
So, the total number of almonds that can be held by the tables is 3 * 72 = 216.
The total number of almonds that can be held by the bowls is 7 * 24 = 168.
The total number of almonds that can be held is 216 + 168 = 384.
However, the total number of almonds is 720. This means that there are 720 - 384 = 336 almonds left after 2 tables break.

After 2 tables break, the remaining 1 table and 7 bowls can hold 72 + 168 = 240 almonds.
Let's calculate how many almonds can be placed in the bowls first.
Since the bowls can hold 24 almonds each and there are 7 bowls, the bowls can hold 7 * 24 = 168 almonds.
However, the bowls can only hold 168 almonds, which is less than the 336 almonds left.
So, the remaining almonds will be placed in the bowls. The number of almonds left to be placed in the remaining table is 336 - 168 = 168.
Since each table holds 72 almonds, the remaining table can hold 168 / 72 = 2.33 times the table's capacity.
However, Carlos can't put a fraction of almonds in the table. We can leave 2 full rows and 48 almonds will be left.

Next, Carlos eats one-fifth of all the almonds.
One-fifth of 720 is 720 / 5 = 144.
So, Carlos eats 144 almonds.
The remaining almonds are 720 - 144 = 576.

Now, we need to find out how many more bowls Carlos needs so he can place all the remaining almonds.
7 bowls can hold 168 almonds, and there are 576 almonds remaining.
So, the number of bowls needed to hold the remaining almonds is 576 / 24 = 24.
However, 24 is the total number of bowls needed to hold the almonds.
Since Carlos already has 7 bowls, the number of additional bowls he needs is 24 - 7 = 17.

How much should Keisha pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?",85.0,"To find out how much Keisha should pay for all the skeins of wool she needs, we need to calculate the total number of skeins required and then multiply it by the cost per dozen.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of skeins required for the quadruplets**

For each grandchild, Keisha needs to make:
- 1 shawl (5 skeins)
- 1 sweater (6 skeins)
- 1 poncho (8 skeins)
- 1 pair of gloves (8 skeins)
- 1 pair of mittens (14 skeins)

Total skeins per grandchild = 5 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 14 = 41 skeins

Since there are 4 grandchildren, the total number of skeins required for all of them is:
41 skeins/grandchild * 4 grandchildren = 164 skeins

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of skeins required for Keisha's warm jackets**

Keisha wants to make 2 warm jackets, each needing 8 skeins of wool.
Total skeins for Keisha's jackets = 2 jackets * 8 skeins/jacket = 16 skeins

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of skeins required**

Total skeins required = Total skeins for quadruplets + Total skeins for Keisha's jackets

Therefore, Keisha should pay $85 for all the skeins of wool she needs.",85.0,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Keisha needs to make clothing for her 4 grandchildren and 2 warm jackets for herself.

- 1 poncho (8 skeins)
- 2 pairs of gloves (2 x 8 = 16 skeins)
- 2 pairs of mittens (2 x 14 = 28 skeins)

Total skeins needed for each grandchild is 5 + 6 + 8 + 16 + 28 = 63 skeins.

Since there are 4 grandchildren, the total skeins needed for all of them is 63 * 4 = 252 skeins.

For herself, Keisha needs 2 warm jackets, each requiring 8 skeins of wool. So, she needs 2 * 8 = 16 skeins.

In total, Keisha needs 252 + 16 = 268 skeins of wool.

The store has a promotion where customers receive a $20 discount on purchases over $100. How much should Keisha pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?

A: Let's think step by step.

Keisha wants to make winter wear for 4 grandchildren.
Each grandchild needs a shawl, sweater, poncho, gloves, and mittens.
So, the total number of items for each grandchild is 5 + 1 (for the jacket) = 6.
Since there are 4 grandchildren, the total number of items is 6 * 4 = 24.
The number of skeins needed for each item is:
- Shawl: 5 skeins
- Sweater: 6 skeins
- Poncho: 8 skeins
- Gloves: 8 skeins
- Mittens: 14 skeins
- Jacket: 8 skeins
So, the total number of skeins needed is:
- 5 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 14 + 8 = 49 skeins
Keisha also needs wool for two jackets for herself.
Each jacket needs 8 skeins of wool.
So, the total number of skeins needed for the jackets is 2 * 8 = 16 skeins.
In total, Keisha needs 49 + 16 = 65 skeins of wool.
Each dozen skeins of wool costs $7.
Since there are 12 skeins in a dozen, the cost of one skein is $7 / 12 = $0.5833.
The total cost of the skeins is 65 * $0.5833 = $37.9165.
Since the store has a promotion where customers receive a $20 discount on purchases over $100, Keisha will get a discount of $20.
So, the final cost is $37.9165 - $20 = $17.9165.

The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand.
20% of ¥15 is 0.20 * ¥15 = ¥3.

The more expensive brand of rice costs 20% more than the normal brand.
20% of ¥15 is 0.2 * 15 = ¥3.
So, the cost of the more expensive brand of rice is ¥15 + ¥3 = ¥18 per kg.

The store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs.

The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,"Let's break down the problem into steps.

1. First, let's calculate how many signatures the sisters have after 6 weeks. 
Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures. In total, they have 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

2. Since they have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they want to have a total of 145 signatures, we need to find out how many signatures they need to collect in the remaining 2 weeks.

Total signatures needed = 145
Current signatures = 67
Remaining signatures needed = 145 - 67 = 78

3. Since Jasmine can only collect signatures on the weekends during the remaining 2 weeks, she will collect 2 signatures per week (not 5 less than her previous collection since we don't know her original collection amount per week). 

Let's assume Jasmine collects 'j' signatures per week now. Since Jasmine has 2 weeks, she can collect 2j signatures.

4. Since we know that they need to collect 78 signatures in total in the remaining 2 weeks, and Jasmine collects 2j signatures, Mia will collect the remaining signatures. So we can write an equation for Mia's total signatures:

2j + Mia's signatures = 78

5. We also know that Mia's total signatures after 8 weeks is 31 + 2x (Mia's signatures collected per week for 2 weeks). We want to find Mia's signatures collected per week for the remaining 2 weeks. 

Since there are two possible scenarios for the above situation, I'll present the two equations for the two weeks and solve for 'x' using the equation above: 2j + (31 + 2x) = 78. I'll then use the two possible values of 'x' to find 'j' and hence the answer.

Scenario 1: If Mia's signatures collected per week in 8 weeks is 'x', then for the last 2 weeks, she could collect x + 2. 
2j + (31 + 2(x + 2)) = 78
2j + 31 + 2x + 4 = 78
2j + 2x + 35 = 78
2j + 2x = 43
j + x = 21.5

Since the values of 'j' and 'x' must be whole numbers, this scenario is not possible.

Scenario 2: If Mia's signatures collected per week in 8 weeks is 'x', then for the last 2 weeks, she could collect x - 2. 
2j + (31 + 2(x - 2)) = 78
2j + 31 + 2x - 4 = 78
2j + 2x + 27 = 78
2j + 2x = 51
j + x = 25.5

Since Mia's signatures collected per week for the last 2 weeks cannot be negative, in this case 'x - 2' is also not possible. So I have to solve for 'j' in this equation, and find the value for 'x' by subtracting 'j' from 25.5.

Let's choose the second scenario to find 'x'. 

j + x = 25.5
Let's find 'j' and 'x' by testing the values.

Jasmine and Mia have 2 more weeks of spring break. 
They want to have a total of 145 signatures by the end of the break. 
Currently, they have a total of 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

So, they need to collect 145 - 67 = 78 more signatures in the remaining 2 weeks.

Jasmine can collect signatures only on weekends, so she will collect 2 * 5 = 10 fewer signatures in the remaining 2 weeks.
Since Jasmine will collect 5 fewer signatures in each of the 2 weeks, she will collect 5 * 2 = 10 fewer signatures in total.

So, the number of signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks is 2 * (her current weekly collection) - 10. 
Jasmine currently collects 36 / 6 = 6 signatures per week (in the first 6 weeks, 36 signatures / 6 weeks).
Therefore, the number of signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks is 2 * 6 - 10 = -4. 
However since the number of signatures cannot be negative, then -4 must be discarded as that does not make sense.

Jasmine will collect 2 * 6 = 12 signatures in the remaining 2 weeks (weekends).

Mia needs to collect the remaining 78 signatures. Since Jasmine will collect 12 signatures, Mia needs to collect 78 - 12 = 66 signatures in the remaining 2 weeks.

Since Mia has 2 weeks to collect the signatures, she needs to collect 66 / 2 = 33 signatures per week.

He can make giant cubes that use 12 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 5 ounces, small cubes that use 1/2 of a ounce, and tiny cubes that are half the size of small cubes. He makes 48 total ice cubes, including 10 giant cubes, 14 small cubes, 12 medium cubes, and some tiny cubes. How many ounces of water does Leon have left?",122.0,"To find out how many ounces of water Leon has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of ice cube and then subtract that from the total amount of water he started with.

Let's start by calculating the amount of water used for each type of ice cube:

1. Giant cubes: 10 cubes x 12 ounces/cube = 120 ounces
2. Medium cubes: 12 cubes x 5 ounces/cube = 60 ounces
3. Small cubes: 14 cubes x 0.5 ounces/cube = 7 ounces
4. Tiny cubes: Since tiny cubes are half the size of small cubes, they use 0.25 ounces/cube. We know that there are 48 total ice cubes, and we already know the number of giant, medium, and small cubes. So, the number of tiny cubes is 48 - (10 + 12 + 14) = 12 cubes. Therefore, the amount of water used for tiny cubes is 12 cubes x 0.25 ounces/cube = 3 ounces.

Now, let's add up the amount of water used for each type of ice cube:

120 ounces (giant) + 60 ounces (medium) + 7 ounces (small) + 3 ounces (tiny) = 190 ounces

Since Leon started with 312 ounces of water, we can subtract the amount of water used from the total amount to find out how many ounces of water he has left:

312 ounces - 190 ounces = 122 ounces

Therefore, Leon has 122 ounces of water left.",122.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many ounces of water Leon used for the giant cubes.
He made 10 giant cubes, each using 12 ounces.
So, the total ounces used for giant cubes is 10 * 12 = 120 ounces.

Next, we need to find out how many ounces of water Leon used for the medium cubes.
He made 12 medium cubes, each using 5 ounces.
So, the total ounces used for medium cubes is 12 * 5 = 60 ounces.

Now, let's calculate the total ounces used for the small cubes.
He made 14 small cubes, each using 0.5 ounces.
So, the total ounces used for small cubes is 14 * 0.5 = 7 ounces.

We are given that Leon made 48 total ice cubes, including 10 giant cubes, 14 small cubes, 12 medium cubes, and some tiny cubes. Since we already know the number of giant, medium, and small cubes, we can find the number of tiny cubes by subtracting the known cubes from the total:
48 (total cubes) - 10 (giant cubes) - 14 (small cubes) - 12 (medium cubes) = 12 tiny cubes.

Now, let's calculate the total ounces used for the tiny cubes.
He made 12 tiny cubes, and we need to find out how many ounces each tiny cube uses. We are given that tiny cubes are half the size of small cubes, and small cubes use 0.5 ounces. So, tiny cubes use 0.5 / 2 = 0.25 ounces each.
The total ounces used for tiny cubes is 12 * 0.25 = 3 ounces.

Now, let's add up the total ounces used for all the cubes:
120 (giant cubes) + 60 (medium cubes) + 7 (small cubes) + 3 (tiny cubes) = 190 ounces.

Leon started with 312 ounces of water. We just calculated that he used 190 ounces for the ice cubes. To find out how many ounces of water he has left, we subtract the used ounces from the initial amount:
312 (initial ounces) - 190 (used ounces) = 122 ounces.

What percentage of the students like to play video games if the number of the students that like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football?",5.0,"## Step 1: Calculate the total number of students who like to hike, play chess, swim, and play football.
First, we add up the number of students who like to hike, play chess, swim, and play football. total_hobbies = 69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103.

## Step 2: Calculate the number of students who like to bake.
Let's denote the number of students who like to play football as F. We are given that the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football. So, the number of students who like to bake = 4F - 3.

## Step 3: Express the number of students who like to bake in terms of F.
We know that the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football. So, the number of students who like to bake = 4F - 3.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of students who like to play video games.
Since the total number of students is 160, and 103 students like to hike, play chess, swim, or play football, the number of students who like to play video games or bake is 160 - 103 = 57.

## Step 5: Set up the equation to find the number of students who like to bake.
We know that the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football. So, 4F - 3 + F = 57, where F is the number of students who like to play football.

## Step 6: Solve the equation to find the number of students who like to play football.
5F - 3 = 57. Add 3 to both sides: 5F = 60. Divide both sides by 5: F = 12.

## Step 7: Calculate the number of students who like to bake.
Now that we know F = 12, we can find the number of students who like to bake. Number of students who like to bake = 4F - 3 = 4(12) - 3 = 48 - 3 = 45.

## Step 8: Calculate the number of students who like to play video games.
We know that the number of students who like to play video games or bake is 57, and the number of students who like to bake is 45. So, the number of students who like to play video games is 57 - 45 = 12.

## Step 9: Calculate the percentage of students who like to play video games.
To find the percentage of students who like to play video games, divide the number of students who like to play video games by the total number of students and multiply by 100. percentage = (12 / 160) * 100 = 7.5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7.5}$",7.5,0,"Let's think step by step.

The total number of students is 160.

69 students like to hike.
8 students like to play chess.
13 students like to swim.
13 students like to play football.

To find the number of students that like to bake, we need to find four times the number of students that like to play football, and then subtract 3:
4 * 13 = 52
52 - 3 = 49
So, 49 students like to bake.

We can find the number of students that like to play video games by subtracting the students that like to hike, play chess, swim, and play football from the total number of students, and then subtracting the number of students that like to bake:
160 - 69 - 8 - 13 - 13 = 57
57 - 49 = 8

However, we also need to consider that the question asks for the percentage of students that like to play video games. To find this percentage, we divide the number of students that like to play video games by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(8 / 160) * 100 = 5

How much money is Oliver still missing?",113.0,"To find out how much money Oliver is still missing, we need to calculate the total cost of the workshop and subtract the amount of money he already has, subtract the amount his friends have donated, and then subtract the amount the charity will cover.

The cost for each day is:
- Hotel: ₣100
- Food: ₣20 (covered by Oliver's friends)

So, the cost for one day is ₣100 + ₣20 (food) + ₣10 (transportation) = ₣130

First, let's find out how much Oliver still needs to cover: ₣260 (total cost) - ₣85 (what Oliver has) = ₣175

Since the charity is covering 1/10 of the remaining cost, we need to find 9/10 of ₣175:
₣175 * (9/10) = ₣157.50

So, the charity will cover ₣157.50, leaving Oliver with ₣175 - ₣157.50 = ₣17.50 to cover.

The cost of food for 2 days is 2 * ₣20 = ₣40 (but Oliver's friends will cover this cost).

The cost of transportation for 2 days is 2 * ₣10 = ₣20.

The total cost of the workshop is ₣200 (hotel) + ₣0 (food, because Oliver's friends will cover this cost) + ₣20 (transportation) = ₣220.

Oliver has ₣85, but the charity will cover 1/10 of the remaining cost. 

First, we need to find out the remaining cost. 
The remaining cost is ₣220 - ₣0 (Oliver has already ₣0 for food) = ₣220.

The charity will cover 1/10 of the remaining cost, which is 1/10 * ₣220 = ₣22.

So, the remaining amount Oliver needs to cover is ₣220 - ₣22 = ₣198.

The answer is ₣198.",198.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Oliver needs to cover the cost of the hotel and transportation for 2 days.

The cost of the hotel for 2 days is ₣100 * 2 = ₣200.
The cost of the transportation for 2 days is ₣10 * 2 = ₣20.
The total cost of the hotel and transportation is ₣200 + ₣20 = ₣220.

Oliver's friends have covered the cost of all the food for the workshop, so we don't need to add the cost of food to the total.

Oliver has ₣85, but he needs ₣220 to cover the cost of the hotel and transportation. So, he is still missing ₣220 - ₣85 = ₣135.

However, the local charity has decided to cover 1/10 of the remaining cost of the workshop. 1/10 of ₣135 is ₣135 / 10 = ₣13.50.

So, the local charity will cover ₣13.50, and Oliver will still be missing ₣135 - ₣13.50 = ₣121.50.

The bakery has a promotion that if one buys 7 bagels or more, they get a 20% discount on bagels. How much more do 4 loaves of bread cost than 8 bagels?",12.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of 4 loaves of bread and the cost of 8 bagels, and then find the difference between the two.

**Cost of 4 loaves of bread:**
1 loaf of bread costs €5, so 4 loaves of bread cost:
4 x €5 = €20

**Cost of 8 bagels:**
The cost of a bagel is one-fourth of a loaf of bread, which is:
€5 / 4 = €1.25
So, 8 bagels cost:
8 x €1.25 = €10

**Discount on 8 bagels:**
Since the bakery offers a 20% discount on 7 bagels or more, we need to calculate the discount on 8 bagels:
20% of €10 = 0.20 x €10 = €2
So, the discount on 8 bagels is €2.

**Cost of 8 bagels after discount:**
The cost of 8 bagels after the discount is:
€10 - €2 = €8

**Difference between 4 loaves of bread and 8 bagels:**
Now, we need to find the difference between the cost of 4 loaves of bread and the cost of 8 bagels after the discount:
€20 - €8 = €12

Therefore, 4 loaves of bread cost €12 more than 8 bagels.",8.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of a bagel. 
The cost of a loaf of bread is €5.
The cost of a bagel is 1/4 of a loaf of bread, so it is 5 / 4 = €1.25.

Next, we need to find the total cost of 8 bagels with a 20% discount. 
First, the total cost of 8 bagels is 8 * 1.25 = €10.
The discount is 20% of €10, which is 0.2 * 10 = €2.
So, the total cost of 8 bagels with a discount is 10 - 2 = €8.

Since the bakery has a promotion that includes 7 bagels or more, we don't need to calculate the discount for 8 bagels.

Now, let's calculate the cost of 4 loaves of bread.
The cost of 4 loaves of bread is 4 * 5 = €20.

Finally, we need to find the difference between the cost of 4 loaves of bread and 8 bagels.
The cost of 4 loaves of bread is €20.
The cost of 8 bagels is €8.

How much more money does Elena have left than Jamal after they leave the store?",8.0,"## Step 1: Calculate the total cost of anchors for Elena
Elena wants to buy 15 anchors at $0.26 each. The total cost of anchors for Elena is 15 * $0.26 = $3.90.

## Step 2: Calculate the total cost of nails for Elena
Elena needs 9 nails at $0.61 each. The total cost of nails for Elena is 9 * $0.61 = $5.49.

## Step 3: Calculate the total cost of paint for Elena
Elena buys 10 gallons of paint. The cost of paint for Elena is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00.

## Step 4: Calculate the total cost of Elena's purchases
The total cost of Elena's purchases is the sum of the cost of anchors, nails, and paint. Total cost for Elena = $3.90 + $5.49 + $70.00 = $79.39.

## Step 5: Calculate the amount of money Elena has left
Elena started with $98.39. After buying her items, she has $98.39 - $79.39 = $19.00 left.

## Step 6: Calculate the cost of paint for Jamal
Jamal buys 10 gallons of paint at $7.00 each. The cost of paint for Jamal is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00.

## Step 7: Calculate the discounted cost of paint for Jamal
The store offers a 10% discount on paint for members. The discount on paint for Jamal is $70.00 * 0.10 = $7.00. The discounted cost of paint for Jamal is $70.00 - $7.00 = $63.00.

Elena also buys 9 nails, each costing $0.61. The total cost of nails is 9 * $0.61 = $5.49.

Additionally, Elena buys 10 gallons of paint. Since she is not a member, she doesn't get a discount.

The total cost of Elena's purchases is $3.90 (anchors) + $5.49 (nails) + (10 * $7.00) (paint) = $3.90 + $5.49 + $70.00 = $79.39.

Elena now has $98.39 - $79.39 = $19.00 left.

Jamal starts with $80.

Jamal buys 10 gallons of paint. Since he is a member, he gets a 10% discount. The original price of paint is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00. A 10% discount is $70.00 * 0.10 = $7.00. So, the cost of paint for Jamal is $70.00 - $7.00 = $63.00.

Jamal also buys 3 carpenter pencils, each costing $2. The total cost of pencils is 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

Jamal's total purchase is $63.00 (paint) + $6.00 (pencils) = $69.00.

Jamal now has $80 - $69.00 = $11.00 left.

1. Arash can eat 5 pieces a day.
2. Ava can eat twice as much as Arash, so Ava can eat 5 x 2 = 10 pieces a day.
3. DeShawn can eat twice as much as Ava, so DeShawn can eat 10 x 2 = 20 pieces a day.

Initially, all three can eat 5 + 10 + 20 = 35 pieces a day.

1. Calculate the number of rooms occupied initially:
   The care facility has a capacity of 1900 rooms with 1/4 occupied. 
   So, the number of rooms occupied initially = 1/4 * 1900 = 475 rooms.

2. Calculate the number of rooms out of service initially:
   One-fourth of all the rooms are out of service.
   So, the number of rooms out of service initially = 1/4 * 1900 = 475 rooms.

3. Calculate the total number of rooms initially unoccupied:
   Total number of rooms initially unoccupied = Number of rooms occupied initially + Number of rooms out of service initially
   Total number of rooms initially unoccupied = 475 + 475 = 950 rooms.

4. Calculate the number of patients admitted into the care facility in 3 weeks:
   20 patients are admitted into the care facility each day.

The care facility has a capacity of 1900 rooms.
One-fourth of the rooms are occupied, which is 1900 / 4 = 475 rooms.
One-fourth of the rooms are out of service, which is also 1900 / 4 = 475 rooms.
So, the total number of occupied and out-of-service rooms is 475 + 475 = 950 rooms.

The care facility has 1900 rooms in total.
So, the number of unoccupied rooms is 1900 - 950 = 950 rooms.

A: Let's think step by step.

The care facility has a capacity of 1900 rooms.
1/4 of the rooms are occupied, so the number of occupied rooms is 1900 * 1/4 = 475.
1/4 of the rooms are out of service, so the number of out-of-service rooms is 1900 * 1/4 = 475.
The total number of rooms that are either occupied or out of service is 475 + 475 = 950.
Since 20 patients are admitted each day, in 3 weeks (21 days), the total number of patients admitted is 20 * 21 = 420.
The total number of rooms occupied or out of service after 3 weeks is 950 + 420 = 1370.
The total number of unoccupied rooms is 1900 - 1370 = 530.

However, I made a mistake in my previous answer. Let me re-evaluate the problem.

The care facility has a capacity of 1900 rooms.
1/4 of the rooms are occupied, so the number of occupied rooms is 1900 * 1/4 = 475.
1/4 of the rooms are out of service, so the number of out-of-service rooms is 1900 * 1/4 = 475.
The total number of rooms that are either occupied or out of service is 475 + 475 = 950.
Since 20 patients are admitted each day, in 3 weeks (21 days), the total number of patients admitted is 20 * 21 = 420.
However, this is not the correct way to calculate the number of occupied rooms. We need to calculate the number of occupied rooms after 3 weeks.

Let's calculate the number of occupied rooms after 3 weeks:
The number of occupied rooms after 3 weeks is 475 + 420 = 895.
The total number of rooms that are either occupied or out of service is 895 + 475 = 1370.
The total number of unoccupied rooms is 1900 - 1370 = 530.

**Wednesday:**

* Muffins: 27 boxes
* Apricot pies: 13 fewer boxes than on Thursday, so let's call the number of apricot pies sold on Thursday ""x"". Then, the number of apricot pies sold on Wednesday is x - 13.

**Thursday:**

* Muffins: 11 more boxes than on Wednesday, so the number of muffins sold on Thursday is 27 + 11 = 38 boxes.
* Apricot pies: x boxes

We know that the number of apricot pies sold on Thursday is 21 boxes. So, we can set up the equation:
x = 21

Now we know that the number of apricot pies sold on Wednesday is x - 13 = 21 - 13 = 8 boxes.

**Wednesday:**

* Muffins: 27 boxes
* Apricot pies: 8 boxes

**Thursday:**

* Muffins: 38 boxes

Faisal sold 27 boxes of muffins on Wednesday.

On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday, so he sold 27 + 11 = 38 boxes of muffins.

On Wednesday, he sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie than on Thursday, so he sold 21 - 13 = 8 boxes of apricot pie.

On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. To find the total number of boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday, we add the number of boxes sold on each day:

Q: Faisal is selling muffins and apricot pies for a fundraiser. On Wednesday, he sold 27 boxes of muffin and 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie, than on Thursday. On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday and 21 boxes of apricot pie. On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?

A: Let's think step by step.

On Wednesday, Faisal sold 27 boxes of muffins and 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie than on Thursday. 
Let's call the number of apricot pie boxes sold on Thursday x. Then, the number of apricot pie boxes sold on Wednesday is x - 13.

On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday. 
The number of muffin boxes sold on Thursday is 27 + 11 = 38.

The total number of muffin boxes sold over the two days is 27 + 38 = 65.
The total number of apricot pie boxes sold over the two days is x + (x - 13).

Since Faisal sold as much as he did in the past two days combined on Friday, the total number of muffin boxes sold on Friday is 65.
The total number of apricot pie boxes sold on Friday is x + (x - 13).

We know that the total number of muffin boxes sold on Friday is 65, so 65 = 27 + 38.
This is already known, so let's move on to the apricot pie.

We also know that the total number of apricot pie boxes sold on Friday is x + (x - 13), and the total number of apricot pie boxes sold on Thursday is x. 
Since Faisal sold the same number of apricot pies on Friday as he did over the two days, we can set up the equation x + (x - 13) = x + 21.

Simplifying the equation, we get:
x - 13 = 21
x = 34

So, the number of apricot pie boxes sold on Thursday is 34, and the number of apricot pie boxes sold on Wednesday is 34 - 13 = 21.

Now, let's find the total sales of muffins and apricot pies on each day. 
On Wednesday, Faisal sold 27 boxes of muffins and 21 boxes of apricot pie.
The total sales on Wednesday is (27 * 9) + (21 * 21) = 243 + 441 = 684.

On Thursday, Faisal sold 38 boxes of muffins and 34 boxes of apricot pie.
The total sales on Thursday is (38 * 9) + (34 * 21) = 342 + 714 = 1056.

On Friday, Faisal sold 65 boxes of muffins and 34 + 21 = 55 boxes of apricot pie.
The total sales on Friday is (65 * 9) + (55 * 21) = 585 + 1155 = 1740.

Now, let's find the average daily earning of Faisal. 
The total sales over three days is 684 + 1056 + 1740 = 3480.

2. Remaining students = 120 - 60 = 60 students

3. 45% of the remaining students are choir members or dancers:
   Number of choir members or dancers = 45% of 60 = 0.45 x 60 = 27 students

4. Total students in the three groups = 60 (swimmers) + 27 (choir members or dancers) = 87 students

5. Half of the swimmers are absent for being sick:
   Number of absent swimmers = 60 / 2 = 30 students

6. Total students leaving early = 87 - 30 = 57 students

7. 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups:
   Number of cheerleaders = 3 x 3 = 9 students

8. Total students leaving early to the tournament = 57 + 9 = 66 students

Therefore, 66 students are leaving early to the tournament.",66.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how many students are swimmers. Since 50% of the class are swimmers, we can calculate this as follows:
50% of 120 students = 0.5 * 120 = 60 students are swimmers.

Next, we need to find out how many students are not swimmers. Since there are 120 students in total and 60 are swimmers, the number of non-swimmers is:
120 - 60 = 60 students are not swimmers.

Out of the remaining 60 students, 45% are choir members or dancers. We can calculate this as follows:
45% of 60 students = 0.45 * 60 = 27 students are choir members or dancers.

Now, we need to find out how many students are leaving early to the tournament. We know that half of the swimmers are absent for being sick, so the number of swimmers leaving early is:
60 swimmers / 2 = 30 swimmers are leaving early.

We also know that 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups, so the total number of cheerleaders is:
30 swimmers + 27 choir members or dancers + 3 cheerleaders per group = 30 + 27 + 3 = 60.

However, we need to find the total number of students leaving early, not the total number of people (which includes the cheerleaders). Since the cheerleaders are accompanying the groups, we should not count them as part of the groups. Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is:
30 swimmers + 27 choir members or dancers = 57 students.

The answer is 57.",57.0,0,"Here's the corrected solution:

Q: In Mrs. Garcia's class of 120 students, 50% of the class are swimmers. Out of the remaining class, 45% of the students are choir members or part of dancers. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away tournament. Half of the swimmers are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the tournament?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's find the number of swimmers in the class. 
50% of 120 students are swimmers, so the number of swimmers is 0.5 * 120 = 60.

Since half of the swimmers are absent for being sick, the number of swimmers leaving early is 60 / 2 = 30.

Next, let's find the number of students who are not swimmers. 
The number of non-swimmers is 120 - 60 = 60.

Out of the remaining class, 45% of the students are choir members or part of dancers. 
The number of choir members or dancers is 0.45 * 60 = 27.

Now, let's find the total number of students leaving early to the tournament. 
We have 30 swimmers, 27 choir members or dancers, and 3 cheerleaders for each group. 
Since there are 3 groups, we need to multiply the number of cheerleaders by 3. 
The total number of cheerleaders is 3 * 3 = 9.

The total number of students leaving early is 30 + 27 + 9 = 66.

However, we need to consider that the 3 groups of students (swimmers, choir members or dancers, and cheerleaders) will be traveling together, so we need to add the number of cheerleaders to the number of swimmers and choir members or dancers. 
The total number of students leaving early is 30 + 27 + 9 = 66.

Olga's flowers grow 3meters wide so she needs to leave 12 meters between every plant (including the plants width). Olga already owns 7 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ₣9 at the store. However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",31.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of plants Olga needs to fill the flower bed**

First, we need to calculate the total space available for plants, including the space between them. Since each plant is 3 meters wide, and there are 12 meters between each plant (including the plant's width), the total space for each plant is 3 + 12 = 15 meters.

The total length of the flower bed is 132 meters. To find the total number of plants, we'll divide the total length by the space for each plant:

132 ÷ 15 = 8.8

Since Olga can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the flower bed is completely filled. Therefore, Olga needs 9 plants.

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the plants**

Olga already owns 7 flowers, so she needs to buy 9 - 7 = 2 more plants.

The cost of each plant is ₣9. Since Olga is buying more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase.

The total cost of the plants without the discount is:
2 x ₣9 = ₣18

With the discount, the total cost is:
₣18 - ₣5 = ₣13

**Step 3: Add the cost of the plants to the cost of the initial 7 plants**

Olga already owns 7 flowers, which she bought at the store. The cost of each plant is ₣9, so the total cost of the initial 7 plants is:
7 x ₣9 = ₣63

Adding the cost of the additional 2 plants (₣13) to the cost of the initial 7 plants (₣63), we get:
₣63 + ₣13 = ₣76

Therefore, Olga will spend ₣76 at the store to fill up her flower bed.",76.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many plants Olga can fit in her flower bed. 
The flower bed is 132 meters long, and each plant, including the space between them, is 3 + 12 = 15 meters long.
So, the number of plants Olga can fit is 132 / 15 = 8.8. 
Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, Olga can fit 8 plants in her flower bed.

2. However, Olga already owns 7 flowers, so she only needs to buy 8 - 7 = 1 more plant.
Since Olga only needs to buy one plant, she won't get the discount.

3. The cost of the one plant that Olga needs to buy is ₣9.

4. Now, let's calculate the total cost. 
Olga already owns 7 flowers, and she is buying 1 more, which is a total of 8 flowers.
Each flowering plant costs ₣9, so the total cost is 8 * 9 = ₣72.

The answer is 72.",72.0,0,"Q: Olga has a flower bed that is 132 meters long. Olga wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Olga's flowers grow 3 meters wide so she needs to leave 12 meters between every plant (including the plants width). Olga already owns 7 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ₣9 at the store. However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

A: Let's think step by step.

First, let's calculate the total area of the flower bed. 
The length of the flower bed is 132 meters.

Olga needs to leave 12 + 3 = 15 meters between every plant. 
The width of each plant is 3 meters.

So, the total space each plant occupies is 3 (plant width) + 15 (space between plants) = 18 meters.

Now, we can calculate the total area of the flower bed that the plants will occupy.
The total area is 132 * 18 = 2376 square meters.

Since each plant occupies 18 square meters, the total number of plants that will fit in the flower bed is 2376 / 18 = 132.

However, Olga already owns 7 flowers, so we subtract those from the total number of plants needed.
The total number of plants Olga needs to buy is 132 - 7 = 125.

Olga will receive a ₣5 discount if she buys more than 2 plants, which she will do since she needs 125 plants. 
So, the total discount she will receive is ₣5.

The cost per plant is ₣9, so the total cost of the plants is 125 * 9 = ₣1125.

Since Olga will receive a ₣5 discount, the final amount she will pay is 1125 - 5 = ₣1120.

How many minutes will it take her to peel and saute 150 clams if it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam before peeling it? Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.,163.0,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to peel 150 clams**

Olga can peel 6 clams per minute. To find the time it takes to peel 150 clams, we can divide the total number of clams by the number of clams she can peel per minute:

150 clams / 6 clams/minute = 25 minutes

**Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to wash 150 clams**

It takes 12 seconds to wash each clam. To find the total time it takes to wash 150 clams, we can multiply the number of clams by the time it takes to wash each clam:

150 clams x 12 seconds/clam = 1800 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we can convert the total time to minutes:

1800 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 30 minutes

**Step 3: Calculate the total time it takes to peel 150 clams, including washing**

We need to add the time it takes to wash the clams to the time it takes to peel them:

30 minutes (washing) + 25 minutes (peeling) = 55 minutes

**Step 4: Add the 13-minute break**

After peeling the clams, Olga needs to take a 13-minute break before she can start sautéing them. We can add this break to the total time:

55 minutes (peeling and washing) + 13 minutes (break) = 68 minutes

**Step 5: Calculate the time it takes to sauté 150 clams**

It takes Olga 19 minutes to sauté 30 clams. To find the time it takes to sauté 150 clams, we can multiply the time it takes to sauté 30 clams by 5 (since 150 clams is 5 times 30 clams):

19 minutes x 5 = 95 minutes

**Step 6: Add the time it takes to sauté 150 clams to the total time**

We can add the time it takes to sauté 150 clams to the total time:

68 minutes (peeling, washing, and break) + 95 minutes (sautéing) = 163 minutes

Therefore, it will take Olga 163 minutes to peel and sauté 150 clams.",150.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Olga to peel 150 clams. 
Olga can peel 6 clams a minute. 
To find out how many minutes it takes to peel 150 clams, we need to divide 150 by 6.
So, the time it takes to peel 150 clams is 150 / 6 = 25 minutes.

However, we also need to consider the time it takes to wash each clam before peeling. 
It takes 12 seconds to wash each clam. 
Since there are 150 clams, the total time to wash them is 150 * 12 seconds.
There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we need to convert the total time to minutes by dividing by 60.
The total time to wash the clams is (150 * 12) / 60 = 30 minutes.

Now, we need to add the time it takes to peel the clams and the time it takes to wash the clams.
So, the total time to peel and wash the clams is 25 + 30 = 55 minutes.

After peeling the clams, Olga needs to take a 13-minute break before she can start sautéing them.
So, the total time it takes to peel and sauté the clams is 55 + 13 = 68 minutes.

However, we also need to consider the time it takes to sauté the clams. 
Olga can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes. 
To find out how many minutes it takes to sauté 150 clams, we need to divide 150 by 30.
However, since Olga can't sauté more than 30 clams at a time, we need to find out how many times she needs to sauté the clams.
150 / 30 = 5, so Olga needs to sauté the clams 5 times.
The time it takes to sauté 150 clams is 5 * 19 = 95 minutes.

Now, we need to add the time it takes to peel and wash the clams, the break time, and the time it takes to sauté the clams.
So, the total time it takes to peel and sauté 150 clams is 68 + 95 = 163 minutes.

Andre picks 177 pineapples on Saturday.
He picks 183 pineapples on Sunday.
So, the total number of pineapples picked on the first two days is 177 + 183 = 360.

On Monday, he picks double the number of pineapples he did on Saturday.
So, on Monday, Andre picks 2 * 177 = 354 pineapples.

The total number of pineapples picked in the first 3 days is 360 + 354 = 714.

On Wednesday, Andre is going to sell pineapples in boxes of 21 pineapples each.
He is going to sell each box for $8.

To find out how many boxes he can sell, we divide the total number of pineapples by 21.

1. Calculate the number of pizzas the family eats per day:
   Uncle: 10 pizzas
   Spouse: 20 pizzas
   Combined number of pizzas per day: 10 + 20 = 30 pizzas
   Grandchild eats 2/4 or 1/2 of the combined number of pizzas: 30 * 1/2 = 15 pizzas
   Total pizzas per day: 10 + 20 + 15 = 45 pizzas

2. Calculate the number of pizzas the family eats in one month:
   There are 30 days in a month, so:
   Total pizzas in a month = 45 pizzas/day * 30 days = 1350 pizzas

3. Calculate the number of pizzas the family eats during the first half of the second month:
   Since the family reduces their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month:
   First half of the month = 15 days
   Total pizzas in the first half of the month = 45 pizzas/day * 15 days = 675 pizzas
   Reduction of 60%: 675 * 0.60 = 405 pizzas
   Total pizzas during the first half of the month = 675 - 405 = 270 pizzas

1. The uncle eats 10 pizzas per day.
2. The spouse eats 20 pizzas per day.
3. The grandchild eats two-fourths of the combined pizzas they eat per day.

   The grandchild eats 2/4 * 30 = 15 pizzas per day.
   
The total pizzas the family eats per day in the first month is 10 + 20 + 15 = 45 pizzas.

In one month (30 days), the family eats 45 * 30 = 1350 pizzas.

Now, let's calculate the total pizzas they eat in the second month. 

The family reduces their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 50% for the second half. 

For the first half of the month, their consumption is 40% of their normal consumption (since 100% - 60% = 40%). 
In the first half month (15 days), the family eats 0.4 * 45 = 18 pizzas per day.
So, in the first half month, they eat 18 * 15 = 270 pizzas.

For the second half of the month, their consumption is 20% of their normal consumption (40% - 20% = 20% = 0.2). 
In the second half month (15 days), the family eats 0.2 * 45 = 9 pizzas per day.
So, in the second half month, they eat 9 * 15 = 135 pizzas.

In the second month, the total pizzas the family eats is 270 + 135 = 405 pizzas.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of emails that don't require a response**

Mohammed receives 30 emails a day. 20% of those emails don't require any response. To find 20% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.2:

30 x 0.2 = 6

So, 6 emails don't require a response.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of emails that require a response**

We subtract the number of emails that don't require a response from the total number of emails:

30 - 6 = 24

So, 24 emails require a response.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of emails Mohammed can respond to**

From the 24 emails that require a response, Mohammed can only respond to 2 less than half of them. To find half of 24, we divide 24 by 2:

24 ÷ 2 = 12

Then, we subtract 2 from 12:

12 - 2 = 10

So, Mohammed can respond to 10 emails.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of emails Mohammed responds to in a 6-day work week**

We multiply the number of emails Mohammed can respond to in a day by 6:

10 x 6 = 60

So, Mohammed responds to 60 emails in a 6-day work week.

**Step 5: Calculate the number of emails Mohammed responds to on the last day**

On the last day, Mohammed works overtime and can respond to 10% more emails than usual. To find 10% of 10, we multiply 10 by 0.1:

10 x 0.1 = 1

So, Mohammed can respond to 1 more email on the last day.

We add this to the number of emails Mohammed responds to in a regular day:

10 + 1 = 11

20% of these emails don't require any response.
The number of emails that don't require any response is 20% of 180.
20% can be represented as 0.2. 
So, the number of emails that don't require any response is 0.2 * 180 = 36.

Now, we need to find out how many emails Mohammed responds to in a day.
We subtract the emails that don't require a response from the total number of emails.
So, the number of emails that require a response is 180 - 36 = 144.

From the rest, Mohammed can only respond to 2 less than the 1/2 of them.
1/2 can be represented as 0.5.
0.5 * 144 is 72.
Mohammed can respond to 72 - 2 = 70 emails per day.

Mohammed works overtime on the last day, so he can respond to 10% more emails than usual.
10% can be represented as 0.1.
So, the number of extra emails he can respond to is 0.1 * 70 = 7.

Now, we need to find out how many emails Mohammed responds to in 6 days.
In 5 days, he responds to 70 emails per day.
So, the number of emails he responds to in 5 days is 5 * 70 = 350.
On the last day, he responds to 70 + 7 = 77 emails.
So, the total number of emails he responds to in 6 days is 350 + 77 = 427.

The answer is 427.",427.0,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mohammed receives 30 emails a day.

1. First, we need to find out the number of emails that don't require a response. 
20% of 30 is 0.2 * 30 = 6.
So, the number of emails that don't require a response is 6.

2. Now, we need to find out the number of emails that Mohammed can respond to.
Since 6 emails don't require a response, the number of emails that require a response is 30 - 6 = 24.

3. From the remaining emails, Mohammed can respond to 2 less than half of them.
Half of 24 is 24 / 2 = 12.
So, Mohammed can respond to 12 - 2 = 10 emails.

4. The total number of emails Mohammed can respond to in a normal 5-day work week is 10 * 5 = 50.

5. On the last day, Mohammed works overtime and can respond to 10% more emails than usual.
10% of 10 is 0.1 * 10 = 1.
So, Mohammed can respond to 10 + 1 = 11 emails on the last day.

6. The total number of emails Mohammed responds to in a 6-day work week is 50 + 11 = 61.

gsm-symbolic,meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct,"Ananya walks 24 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 miles of walking on the beach and 14 miles of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?",85.0,"To find the time it takes for Ananya to complete the entire 24-mile walk, we need to first determine her speed on the beach and the sidewalk before and after the injury. 

Let's assume her original speed on the beach is 'b' miles per hour and on the sidewalk is '2b' miles per hour.

The time taken for the entire walk is 24 miles / (b/2) + (2b/2) for the beach and sidewalk, respectively. However, we are given that Ananya walks 10 miles on the beach and 14 miles on the sidewalk, so we should calculate the time for each segment separately.

The time taken on the beach is 10 miles / (b/2). Since 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, we can convert this to hours as 50/60 = 5/6 hours. 

Now we can set up the equation:
10 / (b/2) = 5/6

Multiplying both sides by b/2, we get:
10 = (5b) / 6 

Multiplying both sides by 6, we get:
60 = 5b

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:
b = 60 / 5
b = 12 miles per hour

Now we have Ananya's speed on the beach as 12 miles per hour. 

Ananya's speed on the sidewalk is 2b which is 2 * 12 = 24 miles per hour.

After the injury, her speed decreases by half, so her speed on the beach is 12 / 2 = 6 miles per hour and on the sidewalk is 24 / 2 = 12 miles per hour.

To find the time taken for the beach segment, we use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

Time taken on the beach = 10 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5/3 hours.

Converting this to minutes, we get:
5/3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 100 minutes

Time taken on the sidewalk = 14 miles / 12 miles per hour = 7/6 hours.

Converting this to minutes, we get:
7/6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 70 minutes

The total time taken for the entire 24-mile walk is the sum of the time taken on the beach and the sidewalk:
Time taken = 100 minutes + 70 minutes = 170 minutes

The time taken for Ananya to complete the entire 24-mile walk is 170 minutes.",170.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Ananya walks 24 miles every day on her walking trail. 
The trail includes 10 miles of walking on the beach and 14 miles of walking on the sidewalk.

Her walking speed on the sidewalk is two times the speed of walking on the beach. 
However, her speed has decreased by half due to an injury. 
Let's first find her speed on the beach and sidewalk before the injury.

Since we don't know the actual speeds, let's assume her original speed on the beach is S miles per hour. 
Her original speed on the sidewalk is 2S miles per hour.

After the injury, her speed on the beach and sidewalk is reduced by half. 
So, her beach speed becomes S/2 miles per hour.
Her sidewalk speed becomes 2S/2 = S miles per hour.

Now, we need to find out her time taken to walk on the beach and sidewalk.

Time to walk on the beach = Distance / Speed.
We know the distance on the beach is 10 miles and her speed on the beach is S/2 miles per hour. 
Time taken on the beach = 10 / (S/2) = 20 / S hours.

Time to walk on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed.
We know the distance on the sidewalk is 14 miles and her speed on the sidewalk is S miles per hour. 
Time taken on the sidewalk = 14 / S hours.

We know that 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. 
We need to convert 50 minutes to hours. 
50 minutes = 50/60 = 5/6 hours.

Since her time on the beach is 20 / S hours, we can equate it to 5/6 hours and solve for S. 
20 / S = 5/6.

Now, cross-multiply to find S.
6 * 20 = 5 * S
120 = 5S
S = 120/5
S = 24.

Now that we have S, we can find the time she takes to walk on the beach and the sidewalk.

Time taken on the beach = 20 / S = 20 / 24 = 5/6 hours = 50 minutes.

Time taken on the sidewalk = 14 / S = 14 / 24 = 7/12 hours = (7/12) * 60 = 35 minutes.

Total time taken = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk.
Total time taken = 50 + 35 = 85 minutes.

How many cookies are still hidden in the yard?",64.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amelia initially had 11 dozen cookies. Since 1 dozen = 12 cookies, Amelia had:
11 dozen x 12 cookies/dozen = 132 cookies

2. Amelia ate 5 cookies for breakfast:
132 cookies - 5 cookies = 127 cookies

3. Elena finds 5 cookies:
127 cookies - 5 cookies = 122 cookies

4. Mei finds twice as many as Elena:
Mei finds 2 x 5 cookies = 10 cookies
122 cookies - 10 cookies = 112 cookies

5. Xavier finds 2 less than Mei:
Xavier finds 10 cookies - 2 cookies = 8 cookies
112 cookies - 8 cookies = 104 cookies

6. Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier:
Mohammed finds 8 cookies / 8 = 1 cookie
104 cookies - 1 cookie = 103 cookies

7. Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined:
Mei and Elena combined = 5 cookies + 10 cookies = 15 cookies
Two dozen = 24 cookies
Umar finds 15 cookies + 24 cookies = 39 cookies
103 cookies - 39 cookies = 64 cookies

Therefore, there are 64 cookies still hidden in the yard.",64.0,1,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Amelia initially had 11 dozen cookies. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 11 dozen to a total number of cookies:

11 dozen = 11 * 12 = 132 cookies

Amelia ate 5 cookies for breakfast, so we subtract 5 from the total:

132 - 5 = 127 cookies

Now, let's consider the cookies found by each person:

Elena finds 5 cookies.

Mei finds twice as many as Elena, which is 2 * 5 = 10 cookies.

Xavier finds 2 less than Mei, which is 10 - 2 = 8 cookies.

Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier, which is 8 / 8 = 1 cookie.

Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined. First, let's calculate the total number of cookies found by Mei and Elena:

Mei and Elena found 5 + 10 = 15 cookies.

Two dozen is equal to 24, so Umar finds 24 more cookies than Mei and Elena combined:

Umar finds 15 + 24 = 39 cookies.

Now, let's add up the cookies found by all the people:

5 (Elena) + 10 (Mei) + 8 (Xavier) + 1 (Mohammed) + 39 (Umar) = 63 cookies

These cookies were found by the people, so we subtract them from the total number of cookies Amelia had initially:

Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each place and he gets paid ₣0.5 per collection for each apartment. He also earns an additional 10% in tips. How much money does he make in a week?",1243.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes**

The first 2 complexes have 100 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these 2 complexes is:
100 + 100 = 200

**Step 2: Calculate the number of apartments in the last complex**

The last complex is 35% bigger than the other 2 combined, which means it is 135% of the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes. To calculate this, we multiply the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes by 1.35:
200 x 1.35 = 270

So, the last complex has 270 apartments.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of apartments in all 3 complexes**

Now, we add the number of apartments in the last complex to the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes:
200 + 270 = 470

**Step 4: Calculate the number of vacant apartments**

9 apartments from each of the first 2 complexes were vacant, so the total number of vacant apartments is:
9 + 9 = 18

**Step 5: Calculate the number of apartments that Oscar collects garbage from**

We subtract the number of vacant apartments from the total number of apartments:
470 - 18 = 452

**Step 6: Calculate the number of collections Oscar makes per week**

Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each apartment complex, so the total number of collections per week is:
452 x 5 = 2260

**Step 7: Calculate Oscar's earnings per collection**

Oscar gets paid ₣0.5 per collection for each apartment, so his earnings per collection are:
₣0.5

**Step 8: Calculate Oscar's total earnings per week**

We multiply the number of collections per week by Oscar's earnings per collection:
2260 x ₣0.5 = ₣1130

**Step 9: Calculate Oscar's tips**

Oscar earns an additional 10% in tips, so we multiply his total earnings by 0.10:
₣1130 x 0.10 = ₣113

**Step 10: Calculate Oscar's total weekly earnings**

We add Oscar's total earnings and tips to get his total weekly earnings:
₣1130 + ₣113 = ₣1243

Therefore, Oscar makes ₣1243 per week.",1243.0,1,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Let's think step by step.

The first 2 apartment complexes have 100 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these complexes is 2 * 100 = 200.

The last apartment complex is 35% bigger than the other 2 combined. To find the number of apartments in the last complex, we need to calculate 35% of 200 and add it to 200.

35% of 200 is 0.35 * 200 = 70.

So, the last complex has 200 + 70 = 270 apartments.

However, 9 apartments from each of the first 2 complexes were vacant, so we need to subtract 9 * 2 = 18 apartments from the total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes.

The total number of apartments in the first 2 complexes is now 200 - 18 = 182.

The total number of apartments in all 3 complexes is 182 + 270 = 452.

Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each place, so he collects garbage from 452 * 5 = 2260 apartments in a week.

He gets paid ₣0.5 per collection for each apartment, so his total earnings from collections are 2260 * 0.5 = ₣1130.

He also earns an additional 10% in tips, so his total earnings from tips are 10% of ₣1130, which is 0.1 * 1130 = ₣113.

His total earnings in a week are ₣1130 + ₣113 = ₣1243.

It takes them 6 minutes per room. However, due to a recent injury, the janitor has become slower and it will take them twice as long to clean a room these days. If they work for 8 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?

A: Let's think step by step.

The janitor originally takes 6 minutes per room to clean.
However, due to the injury, it now takes them 6 * 2 = 12 minutes to clean a room.

The janitor has 200 rooms to clean.
It takes them 12 minutes per room to clean.
So, the total time to clean the rooms is 200 * 12 = 2400 minutes.

There are 10 days to complete the task.
Since there are 24 hours in a day, there are 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes in a day.
The janitor works for 8 hours a day, which is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

The total number of minutes worked in 10 days is 10 * 480 = 4800 minutes.

The time spent cleaning rooms is 2400 minutes.
The total time worked is 4800 minutes.

So, the percentage of time spent cleaning is (2400 / 4800) * 100 = 50%.

As the skillet of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 70 pop in the first 10 seconds of cooking, then 2 times that amount in the next 10 seconds. The kernels increase to 4 times the initial popping rate in the next 10 seconds. In the final 10 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 10 seconds. After Noah takes the skillet off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. Noah gives one-fifth of the made popcorn to his brother Luca. How many more pieces of popcorn does Noah have to eat than his brother?",399.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 10 seconds, 70 kernels pop.

2. In the next 10 seconds, 2 times the initial amount pop, which is 2 x 70 = 140 kernels.

3. In the next 10 seconds, 4 times the initial popping rate pop, which is 4 x 70 = 280 kernels.

4. In the final 10 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate of the past 10 seconds, which is 280 / 2 = 140 kernels.

5. A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds also pop from the residual heat, which is 140 / 4 = 35 kernels.

6. To find the total number of kernels that popped, we add the kernels that popped in each 10-second interval: 70 + 140 + 280 + 140 + 35 = 565 kernels.

7. Noah gives one-fifth of the made popcorn to his brother Luca, which is 1/5 x 565 = 113 kernels.

8. To find the number of kernels that Noah has left, we subtract the kernels that Luca got from the total: 565 - 113 = 452 kernels.

9. Since the problem asks for the number of pieces of popcorn, we assume that each kernel represents one piece of popcorn. Therefore, Noah has 452 pieces of popcorn left.

10. To find the number of pieces of popcorn that Luca has, we multiply the number of kernels he got by 1 (since each kernel represents one piece of popcorn): 113 x 1 = 113 pieces of popcorn.

11. To find the difference in the number of pieces of popcorn between Noah and Luca, we subtract the number of pieces that Luca has from the number of pieces that Noah has: 452 - 113 = 339.

Therefore, Noah has 339 more pieces of popcorn to eat than his brother Luca.",339.0,0,"I'll solve the problem step by step.

Let's think step by step.
The kernels pop at a rate of 70 per 10 seconds initially.
In the next 10 seconds, the kernels pop at a rate 2 times the initial rate.
So, the kernels pop at a rate of 2 * 70 = 140 per 10 seconds.
In the next 10 seconds, the kernels pop at a rate 4 times the initial rate.
So, the kernels pop at a rate of 4 * 70 = 280 per 10 seconds.
In the final 10 seconds, the kernels pop at a rate half of the rate in the past 10 seconds.
So, the kernels pop at a rate of 280 / 2 = 140 per 10 seconds.
However, we are interested in the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds, not the rate.
So, the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds is 140.
A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds also pop from the residual heat.
So, the number of kernels that pop from the residual heat is 140 / 4 = 35.
The total number of kernels that popped is the sum of the kernels that popped in each 10-second interval.
So, the total number of kernels that popped is 70 + 140 + 280 + 140 = 530.
Noah gives one-fifth of the made popcorn to his brother Luca.
So, the number of kernels that Noah gives to Luca is 530 / 5 = 106.
The number of kernels that Noah has left is 530 - 106 = 424.
The answer is 424.",424.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Noah starts with 70 popcorn kernels that pop in the first 10 seconds.

In the next 10 seconds, the kernels increase to 2 times the initial rate, so the number of kernels popping is 70 * 2 = 140.

In the next 10 seconds, the kernels increase to 4 times the initial rate, so the number of kernels popping is 140 * 4 = 560.

In the final 10 seconds, the kernels pop at half the rate of the past 10 seconds, so the number of kernels popping is 560 / 2 = 280.

After Noah takes the skillet off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds also pop from the residual heat, which is 280 / 4 = 70.

So, the total number of popcorn kernels is 70 + 140 + 560 + 280 + 70 = 1020.

Noah gives one-fifth of the popcorn to his brother Luca, which is 1020 / 5 = 204.

So, Noah has 1020 - 204 = 816 pieces of popcorn.

The answer is 816.

To find how many more pieces of popcorn Noah has to eat than his brother, we need to subtract the number of pieces Luca has (204) from the number of pieces Noah has (816).

816 - 204 = 612.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The building has 5 white bricks.
2. It has twice as many orange bricks as white bricks, so the number of orange bricks is 2 x 5 = 10.
3. The total number of white and orange bricks is 5 + 10 = 15.
4. Since there are 30 bricks in total, the number of green bricks is 30 - 15 = 15.

Now that we know the number of green bricks, we can find the percentage of green bricks:

Percentage of green bricks = (Number of green bricks / Total number of bricks) x 100

The total number of white and orange bricks is 5 + 10 = 15.
Since there are 30 bricks in total, the number of green bricks is 30 - 15 = 15.
To find the percentage of green bricks, we need to divide the number of green bricks by the total number of bricks and multiply by 100.

Average age = (35 + 59 + 20) / 3 = 114 / 3 = 38 years.

Since we know Keisha's current age is 20, to find how much younger she is than the average, we subtract her age from the average age.
