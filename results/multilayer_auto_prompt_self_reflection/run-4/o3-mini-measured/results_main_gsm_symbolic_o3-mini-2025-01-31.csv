1. The peach drink is 20 liters with 1/5 of it being water. This means it originally contains 20 × (1/5) = 4 liters of water.

2. However, when pouring the peach drink, 5 liters are spilled. Since the drink is uniformly mixed, the spilled 5 liters contain 5 × (1/5) = 1 liter of water.

3. So, the remaining peach drink poured in is 20 − 5 = 15 liters, and it retains 4 − 1 = 3 liters of water.

4. The lemon drink is 16 liters with 1/4 of it being water. This means it contains 16 × (1/4) = 4 liters of water.

5. When the remaining peach drink is combined with the lemon drink, the total volume is 15 + 16 = 31 liters, and the total water is 3 (from peach) + 4 (from lemon) = 7 liters.

If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 6 hours if she spends 2/4 of the time running and three-sixths of the time walking?",36.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Assume Jasmine's walking speed is w miles per hour.  
2. Since she can run five times faster than she can walk, her running speed is 5w mph.  
3. Her skipping speed is given as 3/5 of her running speed, so it is (3/5) × 5w = 3w mph.  
4. We are told that her skipping speed is 6 mph. That gives us the equation:  
  3w = 6  
  w = 6/3 = 2 mph.  
5. Now we know her speeds:  
  Walking speed = 2 mph  
  Running speed = 5w = 5 × 2 = 10 mph  
  Skipping speed = 6 mph (given)  
6. The problem states that during a 6-hour period, she spends 2/4 (which is 1/2) of the time running and 3/6 (which is also 1/2) of the time walking.  
7. Therefore, she runs for 1/2 × 6 hours = 3 hours, and she walks for 1/2 × 6 hours = 3 hours.  
8. Calculate the distance covered while running:  
  Distance running = running speed × time = 10 mph × 3 hours = 30 miles.  
9. Calculate the distance covered while walking:  
  Distance walking = walking speed × time = 2 mph × 3 hours = 6 miles.  
10. Total distance traveled = distance running + distance walking = 30 miles + 6 miles = 36 miles.

If a 300 ounces bag has 5 servings, how many ounces can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2360 and you have already consumed 1700 calories?",144.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, find out how many calories you have left for the day.
  Daily calorie target = 2360 calories.
  Calories already consumed = 1700 calories.
  Remaining calories = 2360 - 1700 = 660 calories.

2. Next, determine the calories per ounce of bread.
  According to the nutritional info, one serving of bread has 275 calories.
  A 300-ounce bag contains 5 servings, so the ounces per serving = 300 / 5 = 60 ounces.
  Thus, calories per ounce = 275 / 60.

3. Now, calculate how many ounces of bread you can eat with the remaining 660 calories.
  Let x be the ounces you can eat.
  Since each ounce has 275/60 calories, we have:
    (275/60) × x = 660
  Solve for x by multiplying both sides by (60/275):
    x = 660 × (60/275)

4. Simplify the calculation:
  x = (660 × 60) / 275 = 39600 / 275
  Divide numerator and denominator by 5:

If James sells 6 bunchs of lilies, 25 bunchs of daisies and 39 bunchs of roses, how much will he make?",276.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

James sells three kinds of vegetables with the following original prices per bunch:
• Lilies: €1.26 per bunch
• Daisies: €2.53 per bunch 
• Roses: €4.85 per bunch

Since James rounds all his prices to the nearest dollar:
• For lilies: €1.26 rounds to €1 because 1.26 is closer to 1 than to 2.
• For daisies: €2.53 rounds to €3 because 2.53 is closer to 3 than to 2.
• For roses: €4.85 rounds to €5 because 4.85 is closer to 5 than to 4.

• Lilies: He sells 6 bunches × €1 per bunch = €6.
• Daisies: He sells 25 bunches × €3 per bunch = €75.
• Roses: He sells 39 bunches × €5 per bunch = €195.

1. First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Since there are 6 possible outcomes, the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 (or 50%).

2. Next, let's find the probability of rolling an even number in one roll. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So the probability is 3/6 = 1/2.  
For two rolls, the probability of rolling even numbers both times is (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4 (or 25%).

3. Now, we compare the two probabilities. Rolling a number greater than 3 has a probability of 50%, and rolling two even numbers in a row has a probability of 25%.  
We can calculate how much more likely the first event is compared to the second event by finding the percentage increase relative to the second event: 

(Probability of >3 − Probability of two evens) / (Probability of two evens)

₣75 + (60% of ₣75) = ₣75 + 0.60 × ₣75 = ₣75 + ₣45 = ₣120.
Next, the stock price decreases 45% in the second year:
Price after decrease = ₣120 − (45% of ₣120) = ₣120 − 0.45 × ₣120 = ₣120 − ₣54 = ₣66.
Now, the final value of all shares is:
17 shares × ₣66 per share = ₣1122.

1. Sofia's total money is ¥1200.

2. Fudge cost:
 a. The sale says ""Buy 16 kgs at ¥21 per kg, get 5 kgs 2/3 off.""
  • 16 kgs at full price cost: 16 × ¥21 = ¥336.
  • For the 5 kgs discount, 2/3 off means you pay 1/3 of the original price. So, per kg price becomes 21 ÷ 3 = ¥7, and 5 kgs cost: 5 × ¥7 = ¥35.
 b. Together, the special package (16 + 5 = 21 kgs) costs: ¥336 + ¥35 = ¥371.
 c. Sofia scooped up 23 kgs. The first 21 kgs are part of the deal, and the extra 2 kgs are at full price:

• Let M be the total amount of money Liam originally had. We are told that after he makes his purchase his leftover (change) is 8% of his money. That is, his change equals 0.08M.

• The problem says “Liam spent ₣1000” on his items. In other words, the money he used to buy his snacks was ₣1000. Since he did not spend all of his money, the rest was returned as change. Thus,
  M – (money spent) = change  
  M – 1000 = 0.08M

• Solving for M:
  Subtract 0.08M from M on the left:
    M – 0.08M = 1000  
    0.92M = 1000  
  Divide both sides by 0.92:
    M = 1000 / 0.92

• (The exact value of M is not needed further; its role is only to set up the spending.)

• Now, Liam’s ₣1000 expenditure was used to buy 4 bags of popcorn and some pretzels. The vending machines sell popcorn for 25 cents and pretzels for 100 cents. (Here “cents” are the subunits of ₣; for example, ₣1 = 100 cents.)

• Cost for 4 bags of popcorn:
  4 × 25 = 100 cents

• Let p be the number of pretzels Liam bought. Each pretzel costs 100 cents. Thus, the total cost for the pretzels is:
  100 × p = 100p cents

• The combined cost of his purchases is then:
  (popcorn cost) + (pretzel cost) = 100 + 100p

• We know that his total spending was ₣1000. (Interpreting ₣1000 in cents for our calculation, we set the total cost equal to 1000 cents.)
  Therefore,
    100 + 100p = 1000

• Solve for p:
  Subtract 100 from both sides:
    100p = 1000 – 100 = 900  
  Divide by 100:
    p = 900 / 100 = 9

Kimia's flowers grow 3 feet wide so she needs to leave 15.0 feet between every plant. Kimia already owns 11 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ¥3 at the store, how much money will Kimia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",3.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

Step 1: Determine how many plants are needed.  
When planting in a line along a 180‑foot bed, each plant will take up 3 feet of space and there must be a 15‑foot gap between consecutive plants. Notice that a gap is only needed between plants (not after the final plant). Thus, if n plants are used, the total length required is:  
  Total Length = (n × 3 feet) + ((n – 1) × 15 feet)

Step 2: Find the maximum number of plants that fit without exceeding 180 feet.  
We set up the inequality:  
  3n + 15(n – 1) ≤ 180

Simplify it:  
  3n + 15n – 15 ≤ 180  
  18n – 15 ≤ 180  
  18n ≤ 195  
  n ≤ 195/18 ≈ 10.83

Since n must be a whole number, the maximum full plants that can fit is n = 10.

Step 3: Calculate the total length used by 10 plants.  
  Length = (10 × 3) + (9 × 15) = 30 + 135 = 165 feet  
This fits within the 180‑foot bed.

Step 4: Determine how many plants Kimia needs to obtain.  
Kimia already owns 11 plants, which is more than the 10 required to fill the bed based on the spacing rules.

Step 5: Calculate the amount of money spent at the store.  
Since she already has enough plants to fill the bed, she does not need to buy any additional ones.  
  Money spent = 0 plants × ¥3 = ¥0

1. Let the length of the fence that Rania gets be R yards.
2. Since Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, Kimia gets R + 30 yards.
3. Together, they have 900 yards of fence. So, we can write the equation:
  R + (R + 30) = 900.
4. Simplify the equation:
  2R + 30 = 900.
5. Subtract 30 from both sides:
  2R = 900 - 30,
  2R = 870.
6. Divide both sides by 2:
  R = 870 / 2,
  R = 435.

The final answer is that Rania gets 435 yards of fence.",435.0,1
main,gsm-symbolic,o3-mini-2025-01-31,There are 7 periods in the day for a normal student but Hiroshi has to take 2 extra classes. Each class is 35 minutes long. He goes to class for 4 days a week. He then spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,42.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.
1. A normal student has 7 periods a day, but Hiroshi takes 2 extra classes, so he has 7 + 2 = 9 classes a day.
2. Each class is 35 minutes long, so the daily class time is 9 × 35 = 315 minutes.
3. Hiroshi goes to class 4 days a week, so his total class minutes per week are 4 × 315 = 1260 minutes.
4. On both Saturday and Sunday, he spends three-sixths (which is the same as 1/2) of his weekly class minutes as extra learning time. That means:
  Extra learning time each day = (1/2) × 1260 = 630 minutes.
5. Combined, his extra learning time over Saturday and Sunday is 630 + 630 = 1260 minutes.
6. Now, add his class minutes and extra learning minutes: 1260 + 1260 = 2520 minutes per week.
7. Convert minutes to hours: 2520 minutes ÷ 60 = 42 hours.

If 66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 27-mile walk, in minutes?",90.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Emma walks 11 miles on the beach and spends 66 minutes doing so.  
   Therefore, her speed on the beach is 11 miles ÷ 66 minutes = 1/6 mile per minute.

2. On the sidewalk, she walks at four times her beach speed.  
   So, her sidewalk speed is 4 × (1/6) = 2/3 mile per minute.

3. Emma walks 16 miles on the sidewalk.  
   The time spent on the sidewalk is distance ÷ speed = 16 miles ÷ (2/3 mile per minute) = 16 × (3/2) = 24 minutes.

Winnie eats 4 eggs a day for 60 days.
So, during the first 60 days, she consumes 4 * 60 = 240 eggs.
Then she increases her consumption to 5 eggs a day for 96 days.
So, during the next 96 days, she consumes 5 * 96 = 480 eggs.
Now, the total number of eggs eaten in 156 days is 240 + 480 = 720 eggs.
