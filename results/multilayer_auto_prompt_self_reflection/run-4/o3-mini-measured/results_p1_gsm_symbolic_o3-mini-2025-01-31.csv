She bought 6 dozen croissants which cost $19 per dozen, 4 dozen macarons which cost $77 per dozen, and 3 dozen brownies for $118 per dozen. How much was the total cost if she received 25% discount on all purchases?",582.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Calculate the cost of the croissants:
   - Beatriz bought 6 dozen croissants, and each dozen costs $19.
   - So, the cost for the croissants is 6 * $19 = $114.

2. Calculate the cost of the macarons:
   - She bought 4 dozen macarons, and each dozen costs $77.
   - Thus, the macarons cost is 4 * $77 = $308.

3. Calculate the cost of the brownies:
   - She bought 3 dozen brownies, and each dozen costs $118.
   - Therefore, the brownies cost is 3 * $118 = $354.

4. Find the total cost before the discount:
   - Total cost = $114 (croissants) + $308 (macarons) + $354 (brownies) = $776.

5. Apply the 25% discount:
   - A 25% discount means she pays 75% of the total cost.
   - So, the discounted total is 0.75 * $776 = $582.

The answer is $582.",582.0,1

But as I pour it, I spill 7 liters of the mango drink. To make up for that, I add 7 liters of water to the mix. What percentage of the final mix is water?",50.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, consider the mango drink:
 • You start with 16 liters of mango drink, which is 1/9 water.
 • So, the water in the mango drink is (1/9) × 16 = 16/9 liters.
 • The non-water part is 16 − 16/9 = (144/9 − 16/9) = 128/9 liters.

2. However, you spill 7 liters of the mango drink. Since the spill has the same composition:
 • The spilled water is (1/9) × 7 = 7/9 liters.
 • The spilled non-water is 7 − 7/9 = (63/9 − 7/9) = 56/9 liters.

3. The remaining mango drink after the spill is:
 • Total remaining mango drink: 16 − 7 = 9 liters.
 • Remaining water: 16/9 − 7/9 = 9/9 = 1 liter.
 • Remaining non-water: 128/9 − 56/9 = 72/9 = 8 liters.

4. Next, consider the apple drink:
 • You have 14 liters of apple drink, which is 1/2 water.
 • So, the water in the apple drink is (1/2) × 14 = 7 liters.
 • The non-water part is also 14 − 7 = 7 liters.

5. Now mix the remaining mango drink with the apple drink:
 • Total volume = 9 liters (mango) + 14 liters (apple) = 23 liters.
 • Total water = 1 liter (mango) + 7 liters (apple) = 8 liters.
 • Total non-water = 8 liters (mango) + 7 liters (apple) = 15 liters.

6. To make up for the lost drink, you add 7 liters of water:
 • New total volume = 23 liters + 7 liters = 30 liters.
 • New total water = 8 liters + 7 liters = 15 liters.
 • The non-water quantity remains at 15 liters.

7. Finally, calculate the percentage of water in the final mix:
 • The fraction of water = 15 liters water / 30 liters total = 1/2 = 50%.
 • So, the percentage of water is 50%.

1. Let w be Mei's walking speed in miles per hour.
2. Mei runs 4 times faster than she walks, so her running speed is 4w.
3. Mei skips at half her running speed. So, her skipping speed is (1/2) × 4w = 2w.
4. It’s given that Mei can skip at 2 miles per hour. This means:
  2w = 2
  ⇒ w = 1 mile per hour.
5. Now we know:
  Walking speed = 1 mph,
  Running speed = 4 mph,
  Skipping speed = 2 mph.
6. Mei’s total time is 10 hours. The time spent on each activity is:
  Running time = (2/5) × 10 = 4 hours,
  Skipping time = (1/2) × 10 = 5 hours.
7. The remaining time for walking is:
  Walking time = 10 − 4 − 5 = 1 hour.
8. Now, calculate the distance for each activity:
  Distance while running = 4 mph × 4 hours = 16 miles,
  Distance while skipping = 2 mph × 5 hours = 10 miles,
  Distance while walking = 1 mph × 1 hour = 1 mile.
9. Adding all the distances together:
  Total distance = 16 + 10 + 1 = 27 miles.

1. First, we determine how many ounces are in one serving. The bag weighs 150 oz and contains 5 servings. So, one serving weighs 150 oz / 5 = 30 oz.

2. Each serving contains 200 calories.

3. Your daily calorie target is 2300 calories. You have already consumed 1200 calories, but you also exercised for 100 calories. Exercising effectively gives you an extra 100-calorie allowance. So, the calories still available for eating are:
   2300 - 1200 + 100 = 1200 calories.

4. Since each serving is 200 calories, the number of servings you can eat with 1200 calories is:

1. First, determine the rounded price per basket for each type of flower.
   - Tulips cost ₺3.24 per basket and round to ₺3 (since 0.24 < 0.50).
   - Lilies cost ₺3.57 per basket and round to ₺4 (since 0.57 ≥ 0.50).

1. The ratio of sugar to water is 63:14. This means that if we let k be the common multiplier, then:
  Sugar = 63k (teaspoons)
  Water = 14k (cups)

2. The ratio of milk to water is given as 9:7. Using the water amount from above (14k cups), the milk can be calculated as follows:
  Milk = (9/7) × (14k) = 18k (tablespoons)

3. Now, the total amount of sugar (in teaspoons), water (in cups), and milk (in tablespoons) is given as:

1. First, we determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 on a 20‐sided die.  
• The numbers greater than 10 are 11, 12, …, 20.  
• There are 10 outcomes out of 20.  
• So, the probability is 10/20 = 0.5 (or 50%).

2. Next, we calculate the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row.  
• On a 20‐sided die, there are 10 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, …, 19), so the probability of rolling an odd number in one roll is 10/20 = 0.5.  
• For four independent rolls, the probability is (0.5)^4 = 0.0625 (or 6.25%).

3. Now, we compare the two probabilities.  
• The probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is 0.5, and the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row is 0.0625.  
• To find how much more likely the first event is than the second, we find the increase relative to the probability of rolling four odd numbers:  

  Difference = 0.5 - 0.0625 = 0.4375  
  Relative increase = (0.4375 / 0.0625) × 100% = 7 × 100% = 700%.

1. Mateo works 6 hours a day, 3 days a week, so his total working hours per week are 6 × 3 = 18 hours.
2. He earns ₣25 per hour. Therefore, his weekly earnings from his hours worked are 18 × ₣25 = ₣450.
3. In addition, he gets a bonus of ₣205 each week if the company performs well. So, his total weekly earnings become ₣450 + ₣205 = ₣655.

1. First, determine the cost for each person (Emma and each friend). Each person will get:
  • One round of laser tag at €6.
  • €4 in pinball tokens.
  • Three rides on the roller coaster at €10 each, which costs 3 × €10 = €30.

Andre starts with $100.

He gets 3% of his money as change. Since 3% of $100 is $3, he spent 100 - 3 = $97 on his items.

1. Let the width of the office be w feet.
2. Since the length is 16 feet longer than the width, the length is w + 16 feet.
3. The area of a rectangle is given by length × width. Therefore, we have:
  w × (w + 16) = 225.
4. Expanding the expression, we get:
  w² + 16w = 225.
5. Rearranging the equation gives a quadratic equation:
  w² + 16w − 225 = 0.

1. The normal brand of flour costs ₣10 per kilogram. Since Santiago had to buy a brand that costs 40% more, the price per kilogram becomes:  
   10 + (0.40 × 10) = 10 + 4 = ₣14.

2. Santiago uses 3 kilograms of flour per day and buys enough for a week (7 days). So, the total kilograms of flour he buys is:

1. Xavier and Carlos have a total of 229 minutes to reach the cinema.
2. They already lost 32 minutes getting coffee. That leaves them with 229 – 32 = 197 minutes for the walk.
3. Their walking route is as follows:
  • It takes 22 minutes to reach the corner by the library.

1. Emma's green spools are the light green and dark green ones. She has 17 light green spools and 27 dark green spools. So, total green spools = 17 + 27 = 44.

2. Emma has ten times as many magenta spools as green spools. Therefore, the number of magenta spools = 10 × 44 = 440.

3. Emma also has light black and dark black spools. She has 49 light black spools and 17 dark black spools, giving a total of 49 + 17 = 66 black spools.

Oliver starts with 344 grams of water.

1. For the giant cubes, each uses 12 grams. He makes 8 giant cubes, so he uses 8 × 12 = 96 grams.

Chen recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her nephew up to 196. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?",40.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

Chen has several sets of toys:
1. The bag of building blocks contains 31 blocks.
2. The bin of stuffed animals contains 6 stuffed animals.
3. The pack of action figures has a number of action figures that is twice the combined total of blocks and stuffed animals. So, first we add the blocks and stuffed animals: 31 + 6 = 37. Then, the action figures amount to 2 × 37 = 74.
4. The crayon box has 12 different colors of crayon.
5. The tower of stacking rings has 33 multicolored rings.

Next, we add all these toys together:
31 (blocks) + 6 (stuffed animals) + 74 (action figures) + 12 (crayons) + 33 (rings) = 156.

Chen’s total number of toys is 196, which includes a tube of bouncy balls. So, to find the number of bouncy balls, we subtract the total of the other toys from 196:
196 - 156 = 40.

Each cow eats as much as a goat and alpaca eat combined. If there are 21 goats, 7 alpacas, and 21 cows, how many kilograms of grain does Alejandro need?",798.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Each goat eats 9 kilograms of grain.

2. Each alpaca eats 3 kilograms less than twice the amount that a goat eats. First, twice the amount a goat eats is 2 × 9 = 18 kilograms. Then, subtracting 3 gives 18 - 3 = 15 kilograms for each alpaca.

3. Each cow eats as much grain as a goat and an alpaca eat combined. So, each cow eats 9 + 15 = 24 kilograms.

4. Now, calculate the total amount of grain needed:
   - Goats: 21 × 9 = 189 kilograms.
   - Alpacas: 7 × 15 = 105 kilograms.
   - Cows: 21 × 24 = 504 kilograms.

Due to the flu season, 35 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.",50.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The hospital has a total of 800 beds.
2. One-fifth of these beds are out of service. That means:
   Out-of-service beds = 1/5 × 800 = 160 beds.
3. Therefore, the working (or serviceable) beds are:
   Serviceable beds = 800 - 160 = 640 beds.
4. Initially, one-eighth of the total beds are occupied. So:
   Initially occupied beds = 1/8 × 800 = 100 beds.
5. Hence, the initially unoccupied (but available) beds among the serviceable ones are:
   Initially unoccupied beds = 640 - 100 = 540 beds.
6. Due to the flu season, 35 patients are admitted each day. Over 2 weeks (which is 14 days), the total number of new admissions is:
   Total new admissions = 35 × 14 = 490 patients.
7. Adding these new admissions to the initial 100 occupied beds gives:
   Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = 100 + 490 = 590 beds.
8. Finally, the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is the serviceable beds minus the occupied beds:
   Unoccupied beds = 640 - 590 = 50 bed.

On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday and 28 boxes of orange pie. On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the cupcake cost ₺10 and the orange pie cost ₺22, how much was Andre's average daily earning?",980.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. On Monday, Andre sold 24 boxes of cupcakes. For the orange pies on Monday, the question states he sold 16 fewer boxes than he did on Tuesday, which we need to determine next.

2. On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than he did on Monday, so:
   • Tuesday cupcakes = 24 + 11 = 35 boxes.
   Also on Tuesday, he sold 28 boxes of orange pies.

3. Now, using Tuesday’s orange pie number, we can determine Monday’s orange pies:
   • Monday orange pies = 28 - 16 = 12 boxes.

4. On Wednesday, Andre sold as many boxes as he did on the previous two days combined. So for each product:
   • Wednesday cupcakes = Monday cupcakes + Tuesday cupcakes = 24 + 35 = 59 boxes.
   • Wednesday orange pies = Monday orange pies + Tuesday orange pies = 12 + 28 = 40 boxes.

5. Next, find the earnings for each product knowing that the cupcake costs ₺10 and the orange pie costs ₺22:
   • Monday earnings:
     - Cupcakes: 24 × ₺10 = ₺240
     - Orange pies: 12 × ₺22 = ₺264
     - Total Monday = ₺240 + ₺264 = ₺504

   • Tuesday earnings:
     - Cupcakes: 35 × ₺10 = ₺350
     - Orange pies: 28 × ₺22 = ₺616
     - Total Tuesday = ₺350 + ₺616 = ₺966

   • Wednesday earnings:
     - Cupcakes: 59 × ₺10 = ₺590
     - Orange pies: 40 × ₺22 = ₺880
     - Total Wednesday = ₺590 + ₺880 = ₺1470

6. Now, calculate the total earnings over all three days:
   • Total earnings = ₺504 (Monday) + ₺966 (Tuesday) + ₺1470 (Wednesday) = ₺2940

p1,gsm-symbolic,o3-mini-2025-01-31,"In Dr. Lee's class of 125 students, 24% of the class are volleyball players. Out of the remaining class, 40% of the students are robotics club members or part of choir members. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away competition. Half of the volleyball players are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the competition?",62.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Dr. Lee’s class has 125 students in total.

2. First, 24% of the students are volleyball players. To find the number of volleyball players:
  Volleyball players = 24% of 125 = 0.24 × 125 = 30.

3. The problem tells us that half of the volleyball players are absent because they are sick. Therefore, the number of volleyball players available to leave early is:
  Available volleyball players = 30 ÷ 2 = 15.

4. Next, we focus on the remaining students. After excluding the volleyball players, there are:
  Remaining students = 125 − 30 = 95.

5. Out of these 95 students, 40% are robotics club members or part of the choir. Importantly, the wording “or” implies that within these selected 95 students there are two distinct activity groups (robotics and choir). Since no further information is provided about how to split the 40% between the robotics club and choir, a natural interpretation is that the 40% represents the combined total for the two groups and that they are of equal size.

  Combined robotics and choir students = 40% of 95 = 0.40 × 95 = 38.
  Splitting this equally gives:
   Robotics club members = 38 ÷ 2 = 19,
   Choir members = 38 ÷ 2 = 19.

6. Now we have 3 groups from the class that will need to leave early: 
  – The volleyball players who are present: 15 students.
  – The robotics club members: 19 students.
  – The choir members: 19 students.

  Adding these together gives:
   Total from class = 15 + 19 + 19 = 53.

7. Next, the problem states that “3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups.” Since there are 3 groups, the number of cheerleaders is:
  Cheerleaders = 3 groups × 3 cheerleaders per group = 9.

8. Finally, to find the total number of students leaving early (including both the students from the activity groups and their accompanying cheerleaders), we add:
  Total leaving early = 53 + 9 = 62.

Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet. How much older is Liam's uncle than Liam?,22.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Liam’s uncle first saw Comet Halley at the age of 31.
2. Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was twice that age, so he was 2 × 31 = 62 years old.
3. Because the comet appears every 53 years, the gap between two successive sightings is 53 years.
4. That means Liam’s first sighting occurred 53 years before his second, when he was 62 – 53 = 9 years old.
5. Now, notice that the comet’s appearances occurred at fixed intervals. If we assume that Liam’s uncle witnessed the comet again 53 years after his first time, then his second sighting age would be 31 + 53 = 84.
6. It is natural to think that during the comet event when Liam was 62 (his second time), his uncle could also have been observing the comet and would then be 84 years old.

On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?",75.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Let v be Olivia's original speed on the beach. Then her original speed on the sidewalk is 4v.

2. Due to her injury, her speeds are halved. Thus, her injury-adjusted speed on the beach becomes v/2, and on the sidewalk, it becomes (4v)/2 = 2v.

3. Olivia walks 10 kilometers on the beach. Using the formula time = distance/speed, the time spent on the beach is:
  Time on beach = 10 ÷ (v/2) = (10 × 2) ÷ v = 20/v hours.
   We are given that she spends 60 minutes (which is 1 hour) on the beach. Therefore:
  20/v = 1 ⟹ v = 20 km/hr.

4. Now, her injury-adjusted speeds are:
  Beach speed = v/2 = 20/2 = 10 km/hr,
  Sidewalk speed = 2v = 2 × 20 = 40 km/hr.

5. Olivia walks 10 kilometers on the sidewalk. The time on the sidewalk is:
  Time on sidewalk = 10 ÷ 40 = 0.25 hours, which is 15 minutes.

6. Adding the times for the beach and the sidewalk, the total time is:
  1 hour (60 minutes) + 0.25 hour (15 minutes) = 75 minutes.

The answer is 75 minutes.",75.0,1

First, note that 10 weeks is equal to 70 days.
Arjun eats 3 pancakes each day for the first 57 days:
  Total pancakes for these days = 57 * 3 = 171.
Then, he eats 9 pancakes each day for the remaining 70 - 57 = 13 days:
  Total pancakes for these days = 13 * 9 = 117.
Now, add the pancakes from both periods:
  Total pancakes = 171 + 117 = 288.
Since one dozen equals 12 pancakes, the number of dozens needed is:
  288 / 12 = 24.

Noah finds half as many as Winnie, and Oscar finds four dozen eggs more than Tara and James combined. How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?",12.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.
1. Esteban hid 11 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12, the total number of eggs is 11 × 12 = 132 eggs.
2. James finds 4 eggs.
3. Tara finds five times as many eggs as James, so she finds 5 × 4 = 20 eggs.
4. Winnie finds 4 less than Tara, so she finds 20 − 4 = 16 eggs.
5. Noah finds half as many as Winnie, so he finds 16 ÷ 2 = 8 eggs.
6. Tara and James together found 20 + 4 = 24 eggs. Oscar finds four dozen eggs more than that, and since 4 dozen is 4 × 12 = 48 eggs, Oscar finds 24 + 48 = 72 eggs.
7. Adding all the eggs that have been found: 4 (James) + 20 (Tara) + 16 (Winnie) + 8 (Noah) + 72 (Oscar) = 120 eggs.

How much money does he make in a week?,1539.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The first two complexes have 300 apartments each. Together, they have 300 + 300 = 600 apartments.
2. The third complex is 50% bigger than the other two combined. Fifty percent of 600 is 300, so the third complex has 600 + 300 = 900 apartments.
3. In total, there are 600 + 900 = 1500 apartments.
4. Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each apartment. This means he makes 1500 × 2 = 3000 collections in a week.
5. He gets paid ¥0.45 per collection. Therefore, his base earnings for the week are 3000 × ¥0.45 = ¥1350.
6. In addition, he earns 14% on tips. That means his tip earnings are 14% of ¥1350, which is 0.14 × 1350 = ¥189.

1. For the first 10 minutes, the cost is ¥0.7 per minute.  
   Cost for 10 minutes = 10 × ¥0.7 = ¥7.

2. From minute 11 to minute 34, the cost drops to ¥0.5 per minute.  
   The number of minutes in this segment = 34 - 10 = 24 minutes.  
   Cost for these 24 minutes = 24 × ¥0.5 = ¥12.

3. For minutes after 34, specifically from minute 35 to minute 94, the cost is ¥0.1 per two minutes.  
   The number of minutes in this segment = 94 - 34 = 60 minutes.

If they work for 6 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?",60.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.
1. Originally, it takes 6 minutes to clean a floor, but due to the injury, cleaning each floor now takes 6 × 2 = 12 minutes.
2. The maintenance worker needs to clean 180 floors in 10 days, so they clean 180 / 10 = 18 floors per day.
3. The time spent cleaning per day is 18 floors × 12 minutes per floor = 216 minutes.
4. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 216 minutes is 216 / 60 = 3.6 hours.
5. They work for 6 hours each day, so the fraction of the day spent cleaning is 3.6 / 6 = 0.6.

1. In the first 22 seconds, 90 kernels pop.
2. In the next 22 seconds, 3 times that amount pop, which is 3 × 90 = 270 kernels.
3. In the following 22 seconds, the popping increases to 4 times the initial rate, so 4 × 90 = 360 kernels pop.
4. In the final 22 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate of the previous period. Since 360 kernels popped in the previous period, half that is 360 ÷ 2 = 180 kernels.
5. After taking the pot off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final period also pop. That is ¼ × 180 = 45 kernels.
6. Now, add up all the popped kernels:  
   90 + 270 + 360 + 180 + 45 = 945 kernels.
