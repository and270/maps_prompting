p2,gsm-symbolic,o3-mini-2025-01-31,"Sophia went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, and 60 mini cheesecakes. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.
1. Sophia bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen. Since 1 dozen equals 12 donuts, she bought 60 ÷ 12 = 5 dozens of donuts. The cost for the donuts is 5 × $19 = $95.
2. She also bought 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen. That is 5 dozens as well, so the cost for the cupcakes is 5 × $33 = $165.
3. For the 60 mini cheesecakes, let the cost per dozen be x dollars. Since she bought 60 mini cheesecakes, that equals 5 dozens, with a total cost of 5x dollars.
4. The total original price for all items is the sum of the donuts, cupcakes, and cheesecakes: $95 + $165 + 5x = $260 + 5x.
5. Sophia received a 20% discount, which means she paid 80% of the original total. Therefore, the discounted total is 0.8 × (260 + 5x).
6. According to the problem, after the discount she paid $1500. Hence, we have the equation:
  0.8 × (260 + 5x) = 1500.
7. Simplify the equation:
  0.8 × 260 = 208 and 0.8 × 5x = 4x, so:
  208 + 4x = 1500.
8. Solve for x:
  4x = 1500 - 208 = 1292,
  x = 1292 ÷ 4 = 323.
9. Therefore, the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is $323.
The answer is 323.",323.0,1
p2,gsm-symbolic,o3-mini-2025-01-31,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving. A 300 grams bag has 6 servings. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?",350.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, find each person’s healthy daily calorie target using 15 calories per pound.
   • Hiroshi’s target = 220 lbs × 15 = 3300 calories.
   • Tara’s target = 140 lbs × 15 = 2100 calories.

2. Next, determine how many calories each has effectively already consumed.
   • For Hiroshi, he has consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. His net consumption = 1100 – 200 = 900 calories.
   • For Tara, she has consumed 900 calories from food plus 200 calories from ice cream, totaling 900 + 200 = 1100 calories.

3. Calculate the remaining calories allowed before reaching the daily target.
   • Hiroshi’s remaining calories = 3300 (target) – 900 (net consumed) = 2400 calories.
   • Tara’s remaining calories = 2100 (target) – 1100 (consumed) = 1000 calories.

4. Now, examine the popcorn nutritional information. A serving of popcorn is 200 calories and a 300 grams bag contains 6 servings.
   • Total calories in 300 grams = 6 × 200 = 1200 calories.
   • Therefore, calories per gram = 1200 calories / 300 grams = 4 calories per gram.

5. Determine how many grams of popcorn each person would need to reach their remaining calorie allowance.
   • For Hiroshi: 2400 calories ÷ 4 calories/gram = 600 grams of popcorn.
   • For Tara: 1000 calories ÷ 4 calories/gram = 250 grams of popcorn.

6. Finally, find the difference in the amount of popcorn required.
   • Difference = 600 grams – 250 grams = 350 grams.

She already has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges of her large country home. She also purchased 200 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Daphne remain with?",335.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Daphne has window ledges with potted plants already. There are 56 ledges with 8 plants on each. This amounts to 56 * 8 = 448 plants.

2. Two days ago, she received an additional 23 potted plants from the nursery.

3. Yesterday, she purchased 200 new plants.

4. So before giving any plants away, Daphne has a total of 448 + 23 + 200 = 671 potted plants.

5. However, she plans to give away 6 potted plants from each of the 56 ledges. This means she will give away 56 * 6 = 336 plants.

6. Since the plants given away come from the ledges, after giving them away, only 8 - 6 = 2 plants remain on each ledge. That totals 56 * 2 = 112 plants still on the ledges.

7. The extra plants (the 23 from the nursery and the 200 purchased yesterday) remain unchanged, so together these add up to 23 + 200 = 223 plants.

8. Therefore, the total number of potted plants Daphne remains with is 112 (from the ledges) + 223 (the additional plants) = 335.

However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The city is 80 miles across. One‑fourth of the city is 80 ÷ 4 = 20 miles.
2. Initially, the fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes (i.e. a speed of 4 miles per hour). So, in the first hour, it covers 4 miles.
3. After one hour, the wind speed is halved, so the fog bank now moves at 2 miles per hour.
4. The remaining distance to cover to reach 20 miles is 20 − 4 = 16 miles.
5. At 2 miles per hour, covering 16 miles takes 16 ÷ 2 = 8 hours (which is 8 × 60 = 480 minutes).
6. Adding the initial hour (60 minutes) to these 480 minutes gives a total time of 60 + 480 = 540 minutes.

On Thursday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. On Friday, he finished homework early and watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 2-hour episodes. On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?",6.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Santiago watched 4 hours each night. That totals 4 + 4 = 8 hours.  
2. On Friday, he watched a 3‑hour episode and a 45‑minute show. Since 45 minutes is 0.75 hours, Friday’s total is 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.  
3. On Saturday, he watched three 2‑hour episodes. That gives him 3 × 2 = 6 hours.  
4. On Sunday, he watched three 15‑minute episodes. Since 15 minutes is 0.25 hours, Sunday’s total is 3 × 0.25 = 0.75 hours.  
5. Let x be the number of 15‑minute episodes he watched on Thursday. Each episode is 0.25 hours, so Thursday’s total viewing time is 0.25x hours.

Adding all these, the total viewing time is:  
8 + 3.75 + 6 + 0.75 + 0.25x = 20 hours.

Now, combine the known hours:  
8 + 3.75 + 6 + 0.75 = 18.5 hours.  
So, 18.5 + 0.25x = 20.

Subtract 18.5 from both sides to isolate 0.25x:  
0.25x = 20 - 18.5 = 1.5.

She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Nia makes the tea using a sugar to water ratio of 54:27, which simplifies to 2:1. This means for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, there is 1 cup of water.

2. Let the number of teaspoons of sugar be S. Then the number of cups of water is S/2.

3. The recipe states she uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, which means the number of tablespoons of milk equals the number of cups of water. So, milk = S/2.

4. She also uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar, so the tablespoons of cream equal 2S.

5. Adding all the ingredients together, we have:
   - Teaspoons of sugar: S
   - Cups of water: S/2
   - Tablespoons of milk: S/2
   - Tablespoons of cream: 2S

   Total = S + (S/2) + (S/2) + 2S

1. Aisha bought a package of forks with an unknown number of forks; let that number be F.  
2. Her husband then gave her a package of 8 forks, so together she had F + 8 forks.  
3. While preparing the food, she used 16 forks to sample her stuffed peppers. Out of these 16 used forks, 6 were found defective and thrown away. This means that the 10 remaining sampled forks were still good and ended up back in her total. In other words, although 16 forks were taken out temporarily, the net loss from her collection was only the 6 defective forks.  
4. Therefore, from her original collection of F + 8 forks, after discarding the 6 defective ones, she was left with (F + 8 – 6) = F + 2 usable forks.  
5. Then, the guests brought 2 packs of forks with 6 forks in each, which adds 2 × 6 = 12 forks.

In the span of two years, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?",1764.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Bananas per square yard:
 • Ravi has 36 bananas per 4/5 of a square yard.
 • To find the number of bananas per 1 square yard, divide 36 by (4/5):  
  36 ÷ (4/5) = 36 × (5/4) = 45 bananas per square yard.

2. Bananas harvested in one cycle:
 • Ravi's banana field is 10 square yards.
 • So, in one harvest, he gets 10 × 45 = 450 bananas.

3. Apricots harvested in one cycle:
 • The apricot field is 13 square yards with 12 apricots per square yard.
 • Hence, in one harvest, he gets 13 × 12 = 156 apricots.

4. Number of harvest cycles in two years:
 • Ravi harvests every 4 months.
 • Two years = 24 months, so the number of harvests is 24 ÷ 4 = 6 cycles.

5. Total harvest in two years:
 • Total bananas = 450 bananas/cycle × 6 cycles = 2700 bananas.
 • Total apricots = 156 apricots/cycle × 6 cycles = 936 apricots.

He also bought 7 pencils which cost $8 each. Arjun can either pay a one-time $20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases, or not become a member and receive only a 5% discount. What is the least amount Arjun can spend on everything?",212.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, calculate the total cost before any discount:
 • Folders: 12 × $4.75 = $57  
 • Erasers: 8 × $14.5 = $116  
 • Bond paper: 1 × $11 = $11  
 • Pencils: 7 × $8 = $56  
 • Total cost = $57 + $116 + $11 + $56 = $240

2. Next, calculate the cost without membership (5% discount):
 • Discount = 5% of $240 = 0.05 × 240 = $12  
 • Total cost as a non-member = $240 − $12 = $228

3. Now, calculate the cost with membership (20% discount plus a $20 fee):
 • Discount = 20% of $240 = 0.20 × 240 = $48  
 • Discounted cost = $240 − $48 = $192  
 • Add the membership fee of $20: Total cost = $192 + $20 = $212

1. The die has 20 sides, so the total outcomes per roll is 20.

2. Rolling a number greater than 5 means the outcome is one of {6, 7, 8, ..., 20}. There are 15 outcomes (since 20 - 5 = 15).  
   Probability for one roll = 15/20 = 0.75 or 75%.

3. For two rolls in a row, the probability is (15/20) × (15/20) = (0.75)² = 0.5625, which is 56.25%.

4. Now, rolling an even number on a twenty-sided die: there are 10 even outcomes (2, 4, 6, ..., 20).  
   Probability for one roll = 10/20 = 0.5 or 50%.

5. For four rolls in a row, the probability is (0.5)⁴ = 0.0625, which is 6.25%.

If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?",11000.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The original selling price of the townhouse is $400,000.
2. With a 25% discount, the discounted selling price is calculated as:
  Discount = 25% of $400,000 = 0.25 × $400,000 = $100,000.
  Discounted selling price = $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000.
3. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. Since the discount applies to the selling price, we calculate:
  Brokerage fee = 5% of $300,000 = 0.05 × $300,000 = $15,000.
4. The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
  Transfer fee = 12% of $300,000 = 0.12 × $300,000 = $36,000.

After a visit to the vet, Jamal discovered that half of his unspotted puppies actually have spots that were not visible before. What percentage of all the puppies have spots?",90.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Jamal's dog:
 • Total puppies = 131.
 • Initially, spotted puppies = 23, so unspotted puppies = 131 – 23 = 108.
 • The vet discovered that half of these unspotted puppies actually have spots. That is 108 / 2 = 54 additional spotted puppies.
 • Thus, the updated spotted count for Jamal’s puppies = 23 + 54 = 77.

2. Gabriel's dog:
 • Total puppies = 47.
 • Spotted puppies = 13.

3. Yuki’s dogs:
 • Yuki has 54 dogs, and each dog has 13 puppies with spots.
 • Thus, the total number of spotted puppies from Yuki’s dogs = 54 × 13 = 702.
 • (Since each puppy mentioned is spotted, all 702 are counted as spotted.)

4. Now, calculate the totals:
 • Total puppies overall = Jamal’s 131 + Gabriel’s 47 + Yuki’s 702 = 880.
 • Total spotted puppies = Jamal’s 77 + Gabriel’s 13 + Yuki’s 702 = 792.

5. Finally, compute the percentage of puppies that have spots:
 • Percentage = (Total spotted puppies / Total puppies) × 100
 • Percentage = (792 / 880) × 100 = 0.9 × 100 = 90%

Since apples are a rare treat, he only buys four 3-kg boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys twelve 6-kg bags. Hay are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys thirty four 39-kg packs. Corn are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 17-kg sacks. Finally, he buys 43 kgs of groceries, and 27 kgs of tools, and 100 kgs of wood. A farm truck can carry 160 kgs at a time. If the farmer has three trucks, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the purchased items?",4.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, calculate the total weight of each type of item:
 • Apples: 4 boxes × 3 kg = 4 × 3 = 12 kg.
 • Cucumbers: 12 bags × 6 kg = 12 × 6 = 72 kg.
 • Hay: 34 packs × 39 kg = 34 × 39 = 1326 kg.
 • Corn: 20 sacks × 17 kg = 20 × 17 = 340 kg.
 • Groceries: 43 kg.
 • Tools: 27 kg.
 • Wood: 100 kg.

         = 1750 + 43 + 27 + 100  
         = 1793 + 27 + 100  
         = 1820 + 100  
         = 1920 kg.

3. Each truck can carry 160 kg, and there are 3 trucks available.  
 Thus, the total capacity per trip = 3 trucks × 160 kg = 480 kg.

On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?",45.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. For the 40-foot shark:
   - It originally had 18 remoras.
   - 1/6 of 18 remoras swam away, which is 18 ÷ 6 = 3 remoras.
   - So, the remaining number of remoras is 18 – 3 = 15.
   - Each of these remoras is 16 inches long, so the total remora length is 15 × 16 = 240 inches.
   - Convert the shark's length to inches: 40 feet × 12 inches/foot = 480 inches.
   - The percentage of the shark’s body length covered by remoras is (240 ÷ 480) × 100 = 50%.

2. For the 10-foot shark:
   - It has 6 remoras.
   - Each remora is 8 inches long, so the total remora length is 6 × 8 = 48 inches.
   - Convert the shark's length to inches: 10 feet × 12 inches/foot = 120 inches.
   - The percentage of the shark’s body length covered by remoras is (48 ÷ 120) × 100 = 40%.

1. Each bowl holds 24 almonds. Each table holds three times that, so one table holds 3 × 24 = 72 almonds.

2. Initially, Carlos has 7 bowls and 3 tables. However, 2 tables break, leaving him with only 1 working table.

3. Before placing the almonds, Carlos has 720 almonds. Then he eats one‑fifth of them, so the number of almonds remaining is  
  720 − (1/5 × 720) = 720 − 144 = 576 almonds.

4. Now, the capacity of the remaining containers is:  
 • Bowls: 7 bowls × 24 almonds/bowl = 168 almonds  
 • Table: 1 table holds 72 almonds  
 Total capacity = 168 + 72 = 240 almonds.

5. Since 576 almonds need to be placed and the current capacity is only 240 almonds, Carlos needs extra bowls. If each additional bowl holds 24 almonds, let x be the number of extra bowls needed. Then we require:

Keisha wants to make two warm jackets for herself, each needing 8 skeins of wool. Each dozen skeins of wool costs $7. The store has a promotion where customers receive a $20 discount on purchases over $100. How much should Keisha pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?",85.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. For each grandchild, Keisha is making:

   - Sweater: 6 skeins  
   - Poncho: 8 skeins  
   - Gloves: 8 skeins  
   - Mittens: 14 skeins  

2. First, calculate the total skeins needed for one grandchild:  
   5 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 14 = 41 skeins

3. Since there are 4 grandchildren, for all of them she needs:  
   41 skeins/child × 4 = 164 skeins

4. Next, Keisha wants to make 2 jackets for herself, each needing 8 skeins. So for the jackets, she needs:

How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Mohammed uses 3 kg of rice per day for a week, so he needs 3 kg/day × 7 days = 21 kg of rice.

2. The normal rice costs ¥15 per kg. However, since his favorite brand was sold out, he buys a brand that costs 20% more. Therefore, the price per kg for the new rice is:
   15 × 1.20 = ¥18 per kg.

3. The store offers a 40% discount on rice for up to 10 kg. With a discount, the price per kg for the first 10 kg becomes:
   18 × (1 - 0.40) = 18 × 0.60 = ¥10.80 per kg.

4. For the remaining rice beyond 10 kg, the normal price of ¥18 per kg applies. The extra rice is:
   21 kg - 10 kg = 11 kg.

5. Now, calculate the cost of the rice:
   - Cost for the first 10 kg = 10 kg × ¥10.80 = ¥108.
   - Cost for the additional 11 kg = 11 kg × ¥18 = ¥198.
   - Total rice cost = ¥108 + ¥198 = ¥306.

How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, determine the combined total of signatures already collected.  
 • Jasmine has 36 signatures.  
 • Mia has 31 signatures.  
 • Thus, together they have 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

2. Next, find out how many more signatures they need to reach their goal of 145.  
 • Required additional signatures = 145 – 67 = 78 signatures.

3. There are 2 weeks remaining. However, Jasmine’s collection ability changes.  
 • Over the first 6 weeks, Jasmine averaged 36 / 6 = 6 signatures per week.  
 • Due to her collecting only on weekends during the last 2 weeks, her weekly total is reduced by 5, so she will now collect 6 – 5 = 1 signature per week.  
 • Over the 2 remaining weeks, Jasmine will collect 1 × 2 = 2 signatures.

4. Let Mia’s needed weekly collection for the remaining 2 weeks be x signatures per week. Then over 2 weeks, she will collect 2x signatures.

5. Together during the last 2 weeks, they must collect a total of 78 signatures. Setting up the equation:  
  Jasmine’s signatures + Mia’s signatures = 78

Leon starts with 312 ounces of water.
He makes several types of ice cubes:
1. Giant cubes: He makes 10 giant cubes, each using 12 ounces. So, the giant cubes use 10 × 12 = 120 ounces.
2. Medium cubes: He makes 12 medium cubes, each using 5 ounces. So, the medium cubes use 12 × 5 = 60 ounces.
3. Small cubes: He makes 14 small cubes, each using 1/2 ounce. So, the small cubes use 14 × (1/2) = 7 ounces.
4. Tiny cubes: Since he makes a total of 48 cubes and already has 10 + 12 + 14 = 36 cubes, he makes 48 − 36 = 12 tiny cubes. Each tiny cube is half the size of a small cube, so each uses (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4 ounce. Therefore, the tiny cubes use 12 × (1/4) = 3 ounces.

Step 1: Calculate Elena's total spending.
• Anchors: 15 anchors at $0.26 each = 15 × $0.26 = $3.90.
• Nails: 9 nails at $0.61 each = 9 × $0.61 = $5.49.
• Paint: Elena buys 10 gallons at the non-member price of $7.00 per gallon = 10 × $7.00 = $70.00.

Due to the pandemic, 20 patients are admitted into the care facility each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks.",530.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The total number of rooms is 1900.

2. One-fourth of the rooms are occupied initially, so the number of occupied rooms is 1900 × 1/4 = 475.

3. One-fourth of the rooms are out of service, which is 1900 × 1/4 = 475.

4. Since the facility has 1900 rooms in total and 475 of them are out of service, the number of rooms in service (available for occupancy) is 1900 – 475 = 1425.

5. Out of these 1425 operating rooms, 475 are already occupied. Therefore, the initially unoccupied operating rooms are 1425 – 475 = 950.

6. Over 3 weeks (which is 21 days), 20 patients are admitted each day. Thus, the total number of new patients admitted is 20 × 21 = 420. These new patients will occupy 420 of the 950 unoccupied operating rooms.

7. After these admissions, the remaining unoccupied operating rooms are 950 – 420 = 530.

8. However, the 475 out-of-service rooms remain unoccupied as well. To get the total number of unoccupied rooms in the facility, we add the unoccupied operating rooms and the out-of-service rooms: 530 + 475 = 1005.

On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday and 21 boxes of apricot pie. On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?",796.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. On Wednesday, Faisal sold 27 boxes of muffins. His apricot pie boxes on Wednesday were 13 fewer than on Thursday. Since on Thursday he sold 21 boxes of apricot pie, he sold 21 – 13 = 8 boxes of apricot pie on Wednesday.

2. On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday. That is, he sold 27 + 11 = 38 boxes of muffins. (And as given, he sold 21 boxes of apricot pie on Thursday.)

3. The total boxes sold on Wednesday were 27 (muffins) + 8 (apricot pies) = 35 boxes and on Thursday were 38 (muffins) + 21 (apricot pies) = 59 boxes.

4. On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. This means for Friday he sold as many muffins as the sum of Wednesday’s and Thursday’s muffins and as many apricot pies as the sum of Wednesday’s and Thursday’s apricot pies. Thus:
  – Muffins on Friday = 27 + 38 = 65 boxes.
  – Apricot pies on Friday = 8 + 21 = 29 boxes.

5. Now, with the costs given (each muffin costs ₺9 and each apricot pie costs ₺21), we can calculate his earnings per day.

  • Wednesday’s earnings:
    Muffin earnings = 27 × ₺9 = ₺243.
    Apricot pie earnings = 8 × ₺21 = ₺168.
    Total = ₺243 + ₺168 = ₺411.

  • Thursday’s earnings:
    Muffin earnings = 38 × ₺9 = ₺342.
    Apricot pie earnings = 21 × ₺21 = ₺441.
    Total = ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783.

  • Friday’s earnings:
    Muffin earnings = 65 × ₺9 = ₺585.
    Apricot pie earnings = 29 × ₺21 = ₺609.
    Total = ₺585 + ₺609 = ₺1,194.

These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away tournament. Half of the swimmers are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the tournament?",66.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Mrs. Garcia's class has 120 students.  
• 50% are swimmers, so the number of swimmers is 0.50 × 120 = 60.

2. The remaining students are non-swimmers.  
• Total non-swimmers = 120 − 60 = 60.

3. Out of the non-swimmers, 45% are choir members or dancers.  
• Choir/dancers = 0.45 × 60 = 27.

4. However, half of the swimmers are absent because they are sick, so only half of the swimmers are leaving early.  
• Present swimmers leaving early = 60 / 2 = 30.

5. Now, there are two groups of students leaving early:  
• The present swimmers group (30 students)  
• The choir/dancers group (27 students)

6. In addition, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. Since there are 3 groups in total (swimmers, choir/dancers, and cheerleaders as a group by themselves), we interpret it as follows:  
• For each of the 2 student groups (swimmers and choir/dancers), they will get 3 cheerleaders accompanying them. That means extra cheerleaders = 2 × 3 = 6.  
  OR  
• The wording “these 3 groups” may be interpreted as: the swimmers group, the choir/dancers group, and the cheerleaders group (who are additional to these groups) are all leaving early, and each group is accompanied by 3 cheerleaders. This would mean extra cheerleaders = 3 × 3 = 9.

There is a need to clarify the interpretation. The phrase “3 groups of students will need to leave early” indicates:  
 Group 1: Swimmers (adjusted for absences) = 30 students  
 Group 2: Choir/dancers = 27 students  
 Group 3: Cheerleaders, where 3 cheerleaders accompany each of these groups.

Since it says “3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups,” we add 3 cheerleaders for every one of the 3 groups.  
• Total cheerleaders = 3 groups × 3 cheerleaders per group = 9.

7. Now, add up all the students leaving early:  
• Present swimmers: 30  
• Choir/dancers: 27  
• Cheerleaders: 9

Total = 30 + 27 + 9 = 66

2. Olga already owns 7 flowering plants. To fill the flower bed completely, she needs 11 − 7 = 4 more plants.

3. At the store, each plant costs ₣9. So the cost for 4 plants without any discount would be 4 × ₣9 = ₣36.

Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.,163.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, Olga washes the clams. It takes 12 seconds to wash one clam, so for 150 clams she needs:
  150 clams × 12 seconds per clam = 1800 seconds.
  Convert this into minutes: 1800 seconds ÷ 60 = 30 minutes.

2. Next, she peels the clams. She can peel 6 clams per minute, so the time to peel 150 clams is:
  150 clams ÷ 6 clams per minute = 25 minutes.

3. After peeling, she must take a break of 13 minutes.

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 50% for the second half. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?",1755.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, we determine the family’s daily pizza consumption on a normal day:  
 • The uncle eats 10 pizzas.  
 • His spouse eats 20 pizzas.  
 • Together they eat 10 + 20 = 30 pizzas.  
 • The grandchild eats two‐fourths (which is 1/2) of that amount, so he eats 30 × 1/2 = 15 pizzas.  
 • Therefore, the total daily consumption is 10 + 20 + 15 = 45 pizzas.

2. For the first month (with no dietary restrictions), assume the month has 30 days:  
 • Daily consumption = 45 pizzas.  
 • Total pizzas in the first month = 45 × 30 = 1350 pizzas.

3. In the second month, the family goes on a diet with two phases:  
 • For the first half of the month (15 days), their consumption is reduced by 60%.  
  – This means they eat only 40% of the normal amount.  
  – Daily consumption becomes 45 × 0.40 = 18 pizzas.  
  – Total for this period = 18 × 15 = 270 pizzas.  
 • For the second half of the month (15 days), the consumption is reduced by an additional 50%.  
  – This reduction applies to the already reduced amount (18 pizzas), so they now eat 50% of 18 pizzas: 18 × 0.50 = 9 pizzas per day.  
  – Total for this period = 9 × 15 = 135 pizzas.  
 • Total pizzas in the second month = 270 + 135 = 405 pizzas.

4. Finally, we combine the totals from both months:

1. Mohammed receives 30 emails each day.
2. 20% of these emails don't require a response, which means 0.20 × 30 = 6 emails.

1. Let v be Ananya’s original speed on the beach (in miles per minute). Then her original sidewalk speed is 2v because she walks at twice the beach speed.

2. Due to her injury, her speeds are reduced by half. So her effective beach speed becomes (v/2) and her effective sidewalk speed becomes (2v/2) = v.

3. We are told that Ananya spends 50 minutes on the beach. The beach distance is 10 miles. Therefore, using the formula Time = Distance/Speed for the beach, we have:

   • Elena finds 5 cookies.
   • Mei finds twice as many as Elena, which is 2 × 5 = 10 cookies.

1. First, determine the number of apartments where Oscar actually collects garbage:
 • In Complex 1: It has 100 apartments but 9 are vacant, so collections are made in 100 – 9 = 91 apartments.
 • In Complex 2: Similarly, 100 – 9 = 91 apartments.
 • For Complex 3: It is 35% bigger than the other two combined. The other complexes have 100 + 100 = 200 apartments in total, so Complex 3 has 200 × 1.35 = 270 apartments (with no vacancies mentioned).

2. Next, calculate the number of collections per week:
 • Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week per apartment.
 • For Complex 1: 91 apartments × 5 = 455 collections.
 • For Complex 2: 91 apartments × 5 = 455 collections.

7. Noah gives one-fifth of the total popcorn to his brother Luca: 1/5 × 665 = 133 pieces.
8. That means Noah keeps 665 − 133 = 532 pieces.
9. The difference between the number of pieces Noah has and Luca has is 532 − 133 = 399.

The answer is 399.",399.0,1

1. The building contains 5 white bricks.
2. It also has twice as many orange bricks as white bricks, so there are 5 * 2 = 10 orange bricks.
3. Together, the white and orange bricks add up to 5 + 10 = 15 bricks.
4. Since the total number of bricks in the building is 30, the number of green bricks must be 30 - 15 = 15.
5. To find the percentage of green bricks, we calculate (15 green bricks / 30 total bricks) * 100 = 50%.
The answer is 50%.",50.0,1

Olivia, who is younger than Bodhi but older than Keisha, will be 42 in 7 years. How much younger is Keisha than the average age of all three?",18.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.
Olivia will be 42 in 7 years, so currently she is 42 - 7 = 35 years old.
Bodhi is 24 years older than Olivia, so Bodhi is 35 + 24 = 59 years old.
Keisha is 15 years younger than Olivia, so Keisha is 35 - 15 = 20 years old.
The average age of the three is (59 + 35 + 20) / 3 = 114 / 3 = 38.
The difference between the average age and Keisha’s age is 38 - 20 = 18.
The answer is 18.",18.0,1
