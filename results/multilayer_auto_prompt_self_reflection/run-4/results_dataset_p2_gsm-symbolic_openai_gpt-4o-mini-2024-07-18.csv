p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Sophia went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, and 60 mini cheesecakes. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,"To find the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen, we can start by calculating the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes before the discount.

1. **Calculate the cost of the donuts:**
   - Sophia bought 60 donuts.
   - Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, the number of dozens of donuts she bought is:
     \[
     \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ dozens}
     \]
   - The cost per dozen of donuts is $19, so the total cost for the donuts is:
     \[
     5 \text{ dozens} \times 19 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 95 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:**
   - Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes.
   - The number of dozens of mini cupcakes she bought is:
     \[
     \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ dozens}
     \]
   - The cost per dozen of mini cupcakes is $33, so the total cost for the mini cupcakes is:
     \[
     5 \text{ dozens} \times 33 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 165 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Let \( x \) be the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen.**
   - Since she bought 60 mini cheesecakes, the number of dozens of mini cheesecakes she bought is:
     \[
     \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ dozens}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost for the mini cheesecakes is:
     \[
     5 \text{ dozens} \times x \text{ dollars/dozen} = 5x \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   - The total cost before the discount is the sum of the costs of the donuts, mini cupcakes, and mini cheesecakes:
     \[
     95 + 165 + 5x = 260 + 5x \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Apply the 20% discount:**
   - After a 20% discount, Sophia paid 80% of the total cost:
     \[
     0.8(260 + 5x) = 1500
     \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - First, distribute the 0.8:
     \[
     208 + 4x = 1500
     \]
   - Next, isolate \( 4x \):
     \[
     4x = 1500 - 208
     \]
     \[
     4x = 1292
     \]
   - Now, divide by 4 to find \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{1292}{4} = 323
     \]

Thus, the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is \(\boxed{323}\) dollars.",323.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the donuts:**
   - Sophia bought 60 donuts.
   - Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, she bought \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $19.
   - So, the total cost for the donuts is \( 5 \times 19 = 95 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:**
   - Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes.
   - Again, since there are 12 mini cupcakes in a dozen, she bought \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $33.
   - So, the total cost for the mini cupcakes is \( 5 \times 33 = 165 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   - The total cost for the donuts and mini cupcakes is \( 95 + 165 = 260 \) dollars.
   - Let \( x \) be the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen. Since she bought 60 mini cheesecakes, that is also \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the mini cheesecakes is \( 5x \).

4. **Set up the equation for the total cost after the discount:**
   - The total cost before the discount is \( 260 + 5x \).
   - After a 20% discount, she paid $1500. This means she paid 80% of the total cost.
   - So, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     0.8(260 + 5x) = 1500
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - First, divide both sides by 0.8:
     \[
     260 + 5x = \frac{1500}{0.8} = 1875
     \]
   - Now, subtract 260 from both sides:
     \[
     5x = 1875 - 260 = 1615
     \]
   - Finally, divide by 5:
     \[
     x = \frac{1615}{5} = 323
     \]

The cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is $323.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving. A 300 grams bag has 6 servings. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?",350.0,"To determine how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara, we first need to calculate their daily calorie targets and how many calories they have left to consume.

### Step 1: Calculate Daily Calorie Targets

**Hiroshi's Daily Calorie Target:**
- Weight: 220 lbs
- Daily calorie target = 15 calories per pound of body weight
- Daily calorie target = 15 * 220 = 3300 calories

**Tara's Daily Calorie Target:**
- Weight: 140 lbs
- Daily calorie target = 15 calories per pound of body weight
- Daily calorie target = 15 * 140 = 2100 calories

### Step 2: Calculate Remaining Calories

**Hiroshi's Remaining Calories:**
- Calories consumed: 1100
- Calories burned through exercise: 200
- Net calories consumed = 1100 - 200 = 900
- Remaining calories = Daily calorie target - Net calories consumed
- Remaining calories = 3300 - 900 = 2400 calories

**Tara's Remaining Calories:**
- Calories consumed: 900 (food) + 200 (ice cream) = 1100 calories
- Remaining calories = Daily calorie target - Calories consumed
- Remaining calories = 2100 - 1100 = 1000 calories

### Step 3: Calculate Popcorn Consumption

**Calories per Serving of Popcorn:**
- 200 calories per serving
- A bag has 6 servings, so total calories in a bag = 200 * 6 = 1200 calories

**Calories per Gram of Popcorn:**
- A 300 grams bag has 1200 calories
- Calories per gram = 1200 / 300 = 4 calories per gram

**Hiroshi's Required Grams of Popcorn:**
- Remaining calories = 2400
- Grams of popcorn needed = Remaining calories / Calories per gram
- Grams of popcorn needed = 2400 / 4 = 600 grams

**Tara's Required Grams of Popcorn:**
- Remaining calories = 1000
- Grams of popcorn needed = Remaining calories / Calories per gram
- Grams of popcorn needed = 1000 / 4 = 250 grams

### Step 4: Calculate the Difference in Grams of Popcorn

**Difference in Grams of Popcorn:**
- Difference = Hiroshi's grams - Tara's grams
- Difference = 600 - 250 = 350 grams

### Conclusion

Hiroshi needs to consume **350 more grams of popcorn** than Tara.",350.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate Hiroshi's daily calorie target:**
   - Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs.
   - The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight.
   - So, Hiroshi's daily calorie target is 220 lbs * 15 calories/lb = 3300 calories.

2. **Calculate Hiroshi's net calorie intake:**
   - Hiroshi has already consumed 1100 calories.
   - He has burned 200 calories through exercise.
   - So, his net calorie intake is 1100 - 200 = 900 calories.

3. **Calculate how many more calories Hiroshi can consume:**
   - Hiroshi's remaining calorie allowance is 3300 - 900 = 2400 calories.

4. **Calculate the calories in one serving of popcorn:**
   - Each serving of popcorn has 200 calories.
   - A bag of popcorn has 6 servings, so the total calories in the bag is 200 calories/serving * 6 servings = 1200 calories.

5. **Calculate how many servings of popcorn Hiroshi can consume:**
   - To find out how many servings Hiroshi can consume with his remaining calorie allowance, we divide his remaining calories by the calories per serving:
   - 2400 calories / 200 calories/serving = 12 servings.

6. **Calculate the total grams of popcorn Hiroshi can consume:**
   - Since each bag has 6 servings and weighs 300 grams, the weight of one serving is 300 grams / 6 servings = 50 grams/serving.
   - Therefore, the total grams of popcorn Hiroshi can consume is 12 servings * 50 grams/serving = 600 grams.

7. **Calculate Tara's daily calorie target:**
   - Tara weighs 140 lbs.
   - So, Tara's daily calorie target is 140 lbs * 15 calories/lb = 2100 calories.

8. **Calculate Tara's net calorie intake:**
   - Tara has already consumed 900 calories from food and 200 calories from ice cream.
   - So, her total calorie intake is 900 + 200 = 1100 calories.

9. **Calculate how many more calories Tara can consume:**
   - Tara's remaining calorie allowance is 2100 - 1100 = 1000 calories.

10. **Calculate how many servings of popcorn Tara can consume:**
    - To find out how many servings Tara can consume with her remaining calorie allowance, we divide her remaining calories by the calories per serving:
    - 1000 calories / 200 calories/serving = 5 servings.

11. **Calculate the total grams of popcorn Tara can consume:**
    - The total grams of popcorn Tara can consume is 5 servings * 50 grams/serving = 250 grams.

12. **Calculate how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara:**
    - Hiroshi can consume 600 grams of popcorn.
    - Tara can consume 250 grams of popcorn.
    - The difference is 600 grams - 250 grams = 350 grams.

The answer is 350 grams.",350.0,1,0,1,350.0,,,

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 60 minutes to cover every 4 miles of the city. However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city, we first need to understand the initial conditions and the effect of the wind speed change.

1. **City Size**: The city is 80 miles across.
2. **Distance to Cover 1/4 of the City**: 
   \[
   \text{1/4 of the city} = \frac{80 \text{ miles}}{4} = 20 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Fog Coverage Rate**: The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes. Therefore, the rate of coverage is:
   \[
   \text{Rate} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{15 \text{ minutes}}
   \]

4. **Time to Cover 20 Miles at Initial Rate**:
   To find out how long it would take to cover 20 miles at the initial rate:
   \[
   \text{Time} = 20 \text{ miles} \times 15 \text{ minutes/mile} = 300 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Effect of Wind Speed Halving**: The problem states that the wind speed will be halved in one hour. This means that after 60 minutes, the fog will cover less distance than it would have without the wind speed change.

   - In the first hour (60 minutes), the fog covers:
   \[
   4 \text{ miles}
   \]
   - After 60 minutes, the wind speed is halved, which means the fog will cover half the distance in the same amount of time. Therefore, the new coverage rate becomes:
   \[
   \text{New Rate} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \div 2 = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{30 \text{ minutes}}
   \]

6. **Distance Covered After 60 Minutes**: After the first hour, the fog has covered 4 miles. The remaining distance to cover is:
   \[
   20 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} = 16 \text{ miles}
   \]

7. **Time to Cover Remaining 16 Miles at New Rate**:
   Using the new rate of \(\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{30 \text{ minutes}}\):
   \[
   \text{Time} = 16 \text{ miles} \times 30 \text{ minutes/mile} = 480 \text{ minutes}

8. **Total Time to Cover 20 Miles**:
   The total time to cover 20 miles is:
   \[
   60 \text{ minutes} + 480 \text{ minutes} = 540 \text{ minutes}

Thus, it will take a total of **540 minutes** for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city.",4.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge.
2. We need to find out how long it takes for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city.
3. 1/4 of the city is 80 miles / 4 = 20 miles.
4. The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes.
5. To find out how long it takes to cover 1 mile, we can calculate: 
   - 60 minutes / 4 miles = 15 minutes per mile.
6. Now, we need to find out how long it takes to cover 20 miles at the original speed:
   - 20 miles * 15 minutes per mile = 300 minutes.
7. However, we know that the wind speed will be halved in one hour (60 minutes). This means that after 60 minutes, the fog bank will cover less distance.
8. In the first hour (60 minutes), the fog bank covers 4 miles.
9. After 60 minutes, the speed is halved, so it will cover 2 miles in the next hour (60 minutes).
10. Therefore, in the first 60 minutes, the fog bank covers 4 miles, and in the next 60 minutes, it covers 2 miles, totaling 6 miles in 120 minutes.
11. We need to cover 20 miles, so we still have 20 miles - 6 miles = 14 miles left to cover.
12. After the first 120 minutes, the fog bank will continue to cover 2 miles every hour (60 minutes).
13. To cover the remaining 14 miles at the halved speed:
   - 14 miles / 2 miles per hour = 7 hours.
14. Since 7 hours is 420 minutes, we add this to the initial 120 minutes:

On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 2-hour episodes. On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?",6.0,"To find out how many 15-minute episodes Santiago watched on Thursday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he spent watching TV from Tuesday to Sunday, excluding Thursday.

1. **Tuesday**: Watched 4 hours.
2. **Wednesday**: Watched 4 hours.
3. **Thursday**: Let \( x \) be the number of 15-minute episodes he watched.
4. **Friday**: Watched 3 hours and 45 minutes. We convert this to hours:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} + \frac{45 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 \text{ hours}
   \]
5. **Saturday**: Watched three 2-hour episodes:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours}

6. **Sunday**: Watched three 15-minute episodes. We convert this to hours:
   \[
   3 \times \frac{15 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 3 \times 0.25 = 0.75 \text{ hours}
   \]

Now, we can sum the hours watched from Tuesday to Sunday, excluding Thursday:

\[
\text{Total hours from Tuesday to Sunday} = 4 + 4 + 3.75 + 6 + 0.75
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

- \( 4 + 4 = 8 \)
- \( 8 + 3.75 = 11.75 \)
- \( 11.75 + 6 = 17.75 \)
- \( 17.75 + 0.75 = 18.5 \)

So, the total hours watched from Tuesday to Sunday, excluding Thursday, is \( 18.5 \) hours.

Thus, the number of 15-minute episodes Santiago watched on Thursday is \( \boxed{6} \).",6.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total hours Santiago watched from Tuesday to Saturday:**
   - On Tuesday, he watched 4 hours.
   - On Wednesday, he watched 4 hours.
   - On Thursday, he watched some 15-minute episodes (we'll calculate this later).
   - On Friday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show.
     - 3 hours = 3 hours
     - 45 minutes = 0.75 hours
     - Total for Friday = 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.
   - On Saturday, he watched three 2-hour episodes.
     - 2 hours * 3 episodes = 6 hours.

2. **Add the hours from Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday:**
   - Total from Tuesday and Wednesday = 4 + 4 = 8 hours.
   - Total from Friday = 3.75 hours.
   - Total from Saturday = 6 hours.
   - So, total hours from Tuesday to Saturday = 8 + 3.75 + 6 = 17.75 hours.

3. **Calculate the total hours watched on Sunday:**
   - On Sunday, he watched three 15-minute episodes.
     - 15 minutes = 0.25 hours.

She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, and uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the ratios and the total amounts used by Nia.

1. **Understanding the Ratios**:
   - The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 54:27. This can be simplified:
     \[
     \frac{54}{27} = 2
     \]
   - This means for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, there are 1 cup of water.

2. **Milk and Cream Ratios**:
   - Nia uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, which simplifies to 1 tablespoon of milk per cup of water.
   - She uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar.

3. **Setting Up the Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of teaspoons of sugar used.
   - From the sugar to water ratio, the number of cups of water used will be \( \frac{x}{2} \).
   - The number of tablespoons of milk used will be equal to the number of cups of water, which is \( \frac{x}{2} \).
   - The number of tablespoons of heavy cream used will be \( 2x \) (since she uses 2 tablespoons of cream for every teaspoon of sugar).

4. **Total Amount Used**:
   - The total amount of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is given as 240. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x + \frac{x}{2} = 240
   \]

5. **Combining Like Terms**:
   - Combine the terms:
   \[
   x + 2x + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} = 240
   \]
   - This simplifies to:
   \[
   3x + x = 240
   \]
   - Which further simplifies to:
   \[
   4x = 240
   \]

6. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = \frac{240}{4} = 60
   \]

Thus, the number of teaspoons of sugar Nia used is \( \boxed{60} \).",60.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Understanding the ratio of sugar to water**: Nia uses sugar and water in a ratio of 54:27. This means for every 54 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 27 cups of water.

2. **Simplifying the ratio**: The ratio 54:27 can be simplified by dividing both numbers by 27. This gives us a simplified ratio of 2:1. This means for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 1 cup of water.

3. **Understanding the total ingredients used**: Nia used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. 

4. **Finding the total parts in the ratio**: From the ratio of sugar to water (2:1), we can see that for every 2 parts of sugar, there is 1 part of water. This means that for every 3 parts (2 parts sugar + 1 part water), we can represent the total parts of sugar and water as 3x, where x is the number of times the ratio is applied.

5. **Finding the total parts of cream and milk**: Nia uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar and 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water. Since the ratio of sugar to water is 2:1, we can deduce that the amount of cream and milk will also be proportional to the amount of sugar and water used.

6. **Calculating the total parts**: 
   - Let’s denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as S, cups of water as W, tablespoons of cream as C, and tablespoons of milk as M.
   - From the ratio, we have S = 2x and W = x.
   - For cream, since she uses 2 tablespoons for every teaspoon of sugar, we have C = 2S = 2(2x) = 4x.
   - For milk, since she uses 8 tablespoons for every 8 cups of water, we have M = 8W = 8(x).

7. **Setting up the equation**: Now we can express the total as:
   \[
   S + W + C + M = 240
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   2x + x + 4x + 8x = 240
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   15x = 240
   \]

8. **Solving for x**: 
   \[
   x = \frac{240}{15} = 16
   \]

9. **Finding the amount of sugar**: Now we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar:
   \[
   S = 2x = 2(16) = 32
   \]

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the amount of teaspoons of sugar by misinterpreting the total amount of ingredients used and not properly applying the ratios given in the problem. I failed to account for the relationships between the different ingredients and how they contribute to the total of 240 units.

### Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of ratios
- Incorrect total calculation
- Proportional reasoning failure

### Instructions:
1. Identify the ratio of sugar to water (54:27) and simplify it if necessary.
2. Determine the total parts of the ratio (54 + 27 = 81 parts).
3. Calculate the value of one part by dividing the total amount used (240) by the total parts (240 / 81).
4. Calculate the amount of sugar using its ratio part (54 parts) multiplied by the value of one part.
5. Verify that the total of all ingredients matches the expected total based on the ratios and the additional ingredients.

### Solution:
1. The ratio of sugar to water is 54:27, which simplifies to 2:1.
2. The total parts in the ratio are 54 + 27 = 81 parts.
3. The value of one part is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Value of one part} = \frac{240}{81} \approx 2.96
   \]
4. The amount of sugar is:
   \[
   \text{Sugar} = 54 \times 2.96 \approx 160.44 \text{ teaspoons}
   \]
5. The amount of water is:
   \[
   \text{Water} = 27 \times 2.96 \approx 80.04 \text{ cups}
   \]
6. For the milk, since it is 8 tablespoons for every 8 cups of water, we have:
   \[
   \text{Milk} = 8 \text{ tablespoons}
   \]
7. For the heavy cream, it is 2 tablespoons for every teaspoon of sugar, so:
   \[
   \text{Cream} = 2 \times 160.44 \approx 320.88 \text{ tablespoons}
   \]
8. Adding these amounts together:
   \[
   160.44 + 80.04 + 8 + 320.88 \approx 569.36 \text{ (which exceeds 240)}
   \]
   This indicates a miscalculation in the total or the ratios used.

### Final Calculation:
To find the correct amount of sugar, we need to ensure that the total of all ingredients equals 240. 

1. Let \( x \) be the number of teaspoons of sugar.
2. The amount of water will be \( \frac{27}{54}x = \frac{1}{2}x \).
3. The amount of milk is \( 8 \) tablespoons (which is constant).
4. The amount of cream is \( 2x \) tablespoons.

Setting up the equation:
\[
x + \frac{1}{2}x + 8 + 2x = 240
\]
Combining like terms:
\[
3.5x + 8 = 240
\]
Subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[
3.5x = 232
\]
Dividing by 3.5:
\[
x = \frac{232}{3.5} \approx 66.29 \text{ teaspoons}
\]

### General Advice:
- Always clarify the ratios and their relationships before calculating.
- Ensure that the total of all components matches the given total.
- Double-check calculations to ensure proportional reasoning is applied correctly.
- Practice with different ratios and total amounts to become familiar with the method.","--- Beginning of the template ---

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I misinterpreted the problem by not properly accounting for the total number of ingredients used and their respective ratios. I failed to correctly analyze how the ratios of sugar, water, milk, and cream contributed to the total of 240 teaspoons, cups, and tablespoons. This led to an incorrect calculation of the amount of sugar used.

### Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Ratio confusion
- Incorrect total calculation

### Solution:
1. **Identify the ratios**: The ratio of sugar to water is 54:27. This can be simplified to 2:1 (since 54/27 = 2).
2. **Determine the total parts in the sugar-water ratio**: 
   - Sugar: 2 parts
   - Water: 1 part
   - Total parts for sugar and water = 2 + 1 = 3 parts.
3. **Calculate the total parts for milk and cream**: 
   - For every 8 cups of water, 8 tablespoons of milk are used, which corresponds to the 1 part of water.
   - For every teaspoon of sugar, 2 tablespoons of cream are used, which corresponds to the 2 parts of sugar.
4. **Calculate the total parts for all ingredients**:
   - Sugar: 2 parts
   - Water: 1 part
   - Milk: 1 part (8 tablespoons for 8 cups of water)
   - Cream: 2 parts (2 tablespoons for each teaspoon of sugar)
   - Total parts = 2 (sugar) + 1 (water) + 1 (milk) + 2 (cream) = 6 parts.
5. **Determine the value of one part**: 
   - Total amount used = 240 (teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk).
   - Value of one part = 240 / 6 = 40.
6. **Calculate the amount of sugar used**:

I answered the question incorrectly because I miscalculated the total amounts based on the ratios provided. I failed to properly account for the relationships between the different ingredients and their respective ratios, leading to an incorrect total for the teaspoons of sugar used.

### Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of ratios
- Incorrect calculations
- Failure to account for total amounts
- Proportional reasoning

### Solution:
1. **Identify the Ratios**: 
   - The ratio of sugar to water is 54:27. This simplifies to 2:1 (since 54/27 = 2).
   - For milk, the ratio is 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, which simplifies to 1:1.
   - For heavy cream, the ratio is 2 tablespoons of cream for every teaspoon of sugar, which simplifies to 2:1.

2. **Determine Total Parts**:
   - For sugar and water (2:1), the total parts = 2 + 1 = 3.
   - For milk and water (1:1), the total parts = 1 + 1 = 2.
   - For cream and sugar (2:1), the total parts = 2 + 1 = 3.

3. **Calculate Total Amounts**:
   - Let’s denote the amount of sugar as \( S \), water as \( W \), milk as \( M \), and cream as \( C \).
   - From the ratios:
     - \( W = \frac{S}{2} \) (from sugar to water ratio)
     - \( M = W \) (from milk to water ratio)
     - \( C = \frac{S}{2} \) (from cream to sugar ratio)

4. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - The total amount used is given as 240 teaspoons (which includes all ingredients):
   \[
   S + W + M + C = 240
   \]
   - Substituting the relationships:
   \[
   S + \frac{S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} = 240
   \]
   - This simplifies to:
   \[
   S + \frac{3S}{2} = 240
   \]
   - Combine like terms:
   \[
   \frac{5S}{2} = 240
   \]
   - Multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   5S = 480
   \]
   - Divide by 5:
   \[
   S = 96
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   Nia used **96 teaspoons of sugar**.

### Instructions for Future Problems:
1. Carefully read the problem to identify all ratios and relationships.
2. Simplify the ratios to their lowest terms to understand the proportions better.
3. Set up equations based on the relationships between the ingredients.
4. Ensure that all parts of the ratios are accounted for in the total.
5. Solve the equations step-by-step, checking for consistency with the total given.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Aisha was preparing for a lunch party at her house, where she intended to serve stuffed peppers. She noticed that she was out of plastic forks, so she bought a new package of forks. Later, her husband also bought a package of 8 new forks and gave them to Aisha. While Aisha was making the stuffed peppers, she used sixteen of the forks to sample her stuffed peppers, then threw away 6 defective forks. The guests also brought 2 packs of forks, each having 6 inside them. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 32 forks. How many forks were in the package that Aisha bought?",34.0,"Let's denote the number of forks in the package that Aisha bought as \( x \).

1. Aisha bought \( x \) forks.
2. Her husband bought 8 forks.
3. Aisha used 16 forks to sample the stuffed peppers.
4. Aisha threw away 6 defective forks.
5. The guests brought 2 packs of forks, each containing 6 forks, which totals \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) forks.

Now, we can set up the equation to find the total number of forks Aisha had after all these transactions:

\[
\text{Total forks} = x + 8 - 16 - 6 + 12
\]

We know that the total number of forks Aisha had at the end was 32. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
x + 8 - 16 - 6 + 12 = 32
\]

Now, simplify the left side:

\[
x + 8 - 16 - 6 + 12 = x + (8 - 16 - 6 + 12)
\]
\[
= x + (8 + 12 - 16 - 6)
\]
\[
= x + (20 - 22)
\]
\[
= x - 2
\]

Now we have:

\[
x - 2 = 32
\]

To find \( x \), add 2 to both sides:

\[
x = 32 + 2

Thus, the number of forks in the package that Aisha bought is \( \boxed{34} \).",34.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of forks in the package that Aisha bought.
2. Aisha's husband bought 8 new forks, so now she has \( x + 8 \) forks.
3. Aisha used 16 forks to sample her stuffed peppers, so the number of forks left is \( x + 8 - 16 = x - 8 \).
4. Aisha threw away 6 defective forks, so now she has \( x - 8 - 6 = x - 14 \) forks.
5. The guests brought 2 packs of forks, each containing 6 forks, which adds \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) forks.
6. Now, the total number of forks Aisha has is \( (x - 14) + 12 = x - 2 \).
7. We know that this total equals 32 forks, so we set up the equation:

In addition, Ravi owns a 13-square yard apricot field that produces 12 apricots per square yard. The apricots can be harvested every 4 months. In the span of two years, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?",1764.0,"To find out how many more bananas Ravi harvests than apricots in two years, we will first calculate the total harvest of bananas and apricots over that period.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of bananas harvested in two years.

1. **Banana field area**: 10 square yards.
2. **Bananas per four-fifths of a square yard**: 36 bananas.
3. **Bananas per square yard**: 
   \[
   \text{Bananas per square yard} = \frac{36 \text{ bananas}}{\frac{4}{5} \text{ square yards}} = 36 \times \frac{5}{4} = 45 \text{ bananas per square yard}
   \]
4. **Total bananas in 10 square yards**:
   \[
   \text{Total bananas} = 10 \text{ square yards} \times 45 \text{ bananas per square yard} = 450 \text{ bananas}
   \]
5. **Harvest frequency**: Every 4 months means 3 times a year.
6. **Total harvests in 2 years**: 
   \[
   2 \text{ years} \times 3 \text{ harvests per year} = 6 \text{ harvests}
   \]
7. **Total bananas harvested in 2 years**:
   \[
   \text{Total bananas in 2 years} = 450 \text{ bananas} \times 6 = 2700 \text{ bananas}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of apricots harvested in two years.

1. **Apricot field area**: 13 square yards.
2. **Apricots per square yard**: 12 apricots.
3. **Total apricots in 13 square yards**:
   \[
   \text{Total apricots} = 13 \text{ square yards} \times 12 \text{ apricots per square yard} = 156 \text{ apricots}
   \]
4. **Total harvests in 2 years**: (as calculated before) 6 harvests.
5. **Total apricots harvested in 2 years**:
   \[
   \text{Total apricots in 2 years} = 156 \text{ apricots} \times 6 = 936 \text{ apricots}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference between bananas and apricots harvested.

1. **Difference**:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total bananas} - \text{Total apricots} = 2700 \text{ bananas} - 936 \text{ apricots} = 1764
   \]

### Conclusion

Ravi harvests **1764 more bananas** than apricots in two years.",1764.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total area of the banana field:**
   Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field.

2. **Determine the number of bananas produced per square yard:**
   There are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard. 
   To find the number of bananas per square yard, we can set up a proportion:
   \[
   \text{Bananas per square yard} = \frac{36 \text{ bananas}}{\frac{4}{5} \text{ square yards}} = 36 \times \frac{5}{4} = 45 \text{ bananas per square yard}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of bananas harvested:**
   Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field, so the total number of bananas is:
   \[
   10 \text{ square yards} \times 45 \text{ bananas per square yard} = 450 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. **Determine the harvest frequency for bananas:**
   Ravi can harvest his bananas every 4 months. In 2 years (which is 24 months), he can harvest:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ months}}{4 \text{ months per harvest}} = 6 \text{ harvests}
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of bananas harvested in 2 years is:
   \[
   450 \text{ bananas per harvest} \times 6 \text{ harvests} = 2700 \text{ bananas}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total area of the apricot field:**
   Ravi has a 13-square yard apricot field.

6. **Determine the number of apricots produced per square yard:**
   The apricot field produces 12 apricots per square yard.

7. **Calculate the total number of apricots harvested:**
   The total number of apricots is:
   \[
   13 \text{ square yards} \times 12 \text{ apricots per square yard} = 156 \text{ apricots}
   \]

8. **Determine the harvest frequency for apricots:**
   Ravi can harvest his apricots every 4 months. In 2 years (24 months), he can harvest:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ months}}{4 \text{ months per harvest}} = 6 \text{ harvests}
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of apricots harvested in 2 years is:
   \[
   156 \text{ apricots per harvest} \times 6 \text{ harvests} = 936 \text{ apricots}
   \]

9. **Calculate the difference in the number of bananas and apricots harvested:**

Arjun can either pay a one-time $20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases, or not become a member and receive only a 5% discount. What is the least amount Arjun can spend on everything?",212.0,"To determine the least amount Arjun can spend, we will calculate the total cost of his purchases both with and without the membership discount.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost without membership

1. **Cost of folders**:
   \[
   12 \text{ folders} \times 4.75 \text{ dollars/folder} = 57.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of erasers**:
   \[
   8 \text{ erasers} \times 14.50 \text{ dollars/eraser} = 116.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of bond paper**:

   1 \text{ ream} \times 11.00 \text{ dollars/ream} = 11.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of pencils**:
   \[
   7 \text{ pencils} \times 8.00 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 56.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Total cost without membership**:
   \[
   57.00 + 116.00 + 11.00 + 56.00 = 240.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost with membership

1. **Cost of folders**:
   \[
   12 \text{ folders} \times 4.75 \text{ dollars/folder} = 57.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of erasers**:
   \[
   8 \text{ erasers} \times 14.50 \text{ dollars/eraser} = 116.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of bond paper**:
   \[
   1 \text{ ream} \times 11.00 \text{ dollars/ream} = 11.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of pencils**:
   \[
   7 \text{ pencils} \times 8.00 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 56.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Total cost before discount with membership**:
   \[
   57.00 + 116.00 + 11.00 + 56.00 = 240.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Membership fee**:
   \[
   20.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Total cost with membership before discount**:
   \[
   240.00 + 20.00 = 260.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

8. **Calculate the 20% discount**:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 240.00 = 0.20 \times 240.00 = 48.00 \text{ dollars}

### Step 4: Compare the total costs

- Total cost without membership after discount: **$228.00**
- Total cost with membership after discount: **$212.00**

### Conclusion

The least amount Arjun can spend is:
\[
\boxed{212.00} \text{ dollars}
\]",212.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost without any discounts:**
   - Cost of folders: 12 folders * $4.75 each = 12 * 4.75 = $57.00
   - Cost of erasers: 8 erasers * $14.50 each = 8 * 14.50 = $116.00
   - Cost of bond paper: 1 ream * $11.00 = $11.00
   - Cost of pencils: 7 pencils * $8.00 each = 7 * 8 = $56.00

   Now, let's add these costs together:
   - Total cost = $57.00 + $116.00 + $11.00 + $56.00 = $240.00

2. **Calculate the total cost with membership and a 20% discount:**
   - Membership fee = $20.00
   - Total cost before discount = $240.00
   - Discount = 20% of $240.00 = 0.20 * 240 = $48.00
   - Total cost with discount = $240.00 - $48.00 = $192.00
   - Total cost with membership = $192.00 + $20.00 = $212.00

3. **Calculate the total cost without membership and a 5% discount:**
   - Total cost before discount = $240.00
   - Discount = 5% of $240.00 = 0.05 * 240 = $12.00
   - Total cost with discount = $240.00 - $12.00 = $228.00

4. **Compare the two total costs:**
   - Total cost with membership (20% discount) = $212.00
   - Total cost without membership (5% discount) = $228.00

The least amount Arjun can spend is $212.00.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Yusuf is rolling a twenty-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row, than that he rolls four even numbers in a row?",50.0,"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events: rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row and rolling four even numbers in a row with a twenty-sided die.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5.

A twenty-sided die has the numbers 1 through 20. The numbers greater than 5 are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. 

Counting these, we find:
- Numbers greater than 5: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 (15 numbers)

Thus, the probability \( P(\text{greater than 5}) \) is:
\[
P(\text{greater than 5}) = \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is:
\[
P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) = P(\text{greater than 5}) \times P(\text{greater than 5}) = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) \times \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \frac{9}{16}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the probability of rolling an even number.

The even numbers on a twenty-sided die are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20. 

Counting these, we find:
- Even numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 (10 numbers)

Thus, the probability \( P(\text{even}) \) is:
\[
P(\text{even}) = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling an even number four times in a row is:
\[
P(\text{four evens}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16}
\]

### Step 5: Compare the two probabilities.

Now we have:
- Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice: \( \frac{9}{16} \)
- Probability of rolling four even numbers: \( \frac{1}{16} \)

### Step 6: Calculate the difference in percentage points.

To find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 5 twice than to roll four even numbers, we calculate:
\[
\text{Difference} = P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) - P(\text{four evens}) = \frac{9}{16} - \frac{1}{16} = \frac{8}{16} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 7: Convert the difference to percentage points.

To express this difference in percentage points, we multiply by 100:
\[
\text{Difference in percentage points} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]",50.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a twenty-sided die.**
   - The numbers greater than 5 on a twenty-sided die are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. 
   - There are 15 numbers greater than 5.
   - The total number of outcomes on a twenty-sided die is 20.
   - So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is:
     \[
     P(\text{greater than 5}) = \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row.**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is:
     \[
     P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) = P(\text{greater than 5}) \times P(\text{greater than 5}) = 0.75 \times 0.75 = 0.5625
     \]

3. **Determine the probability of rolling an even number on a twenty-sided die.**
   - The even numbers on a twenty-sided die are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20.
   - There are 10 even numbers.
   - So, the probability of rolling an even number is:
     \[
     P(\text{even}) = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]

4. **Calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row.**
   - The probability of rolling an even number four times in a row is:
     \[
     P(\text{even four times}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.5^4 = 0.0625
     \]

5. **Calculate the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row and rolling four even numbers in a row.**
   - The difference is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) - P(\text{even four times}) = 0.5625 - 0.0625 = 0.5
     \]

6. **Convert the difference to percentage points.**
   - To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     \text{Difference in percentage points} = 0.5 \times 100 = 50

1. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - Mia found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. 
   - Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
     \[
     \text{Number of rabbits} = \frac{26}{2} = 13

2. **Determine the total number of animals:**
   - We know the following:
     - Number of rabbits = 13
     - Number of bees = 9
     - Number of wasps = 24

Solution:
Let C be the number of chickens. Then D = (3/4)C. The total number of animals is C + D = 40. Substituting gives C + (3/4)C = 40, which simplifies to (7/4)C = 40. Solving for C gives C = 40 * (4/7) = 22.86 (not possible, so I made a mistake). Instead, I should have set D = (3/4)(40 - D). Solving correctly gives D = 24 ducks.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Mia went to her greenhouse to pick some blueberries and found 2/3 as many beetles as bees in the plot. Mia then found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. In addition, she saw 24 wasps, and 9 bees. What percentage of animals in the plot were rabbits?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 25.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I miscalculated the total number of animals in the plot and did not properly account for the number of rabbits. I failed to correctly interpret the relationships between the different types of animals and their quantities.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect interpretation of relationships
- Oversight in total count

### Solution:
1. **Identify the known quantities:**
   - Number of bees = 9
   - Number of wasps = 24
   - Total white animals = 26 (half of which are rabbits)
   
2. **Calculate the number of rabbits:**
   - Since half of the 26 white animals are rabbits, the number of rabbits = 26 / 2 = 13.

3. **Calculate the number of beetles:**
   - The number of beetles is 2/3 of the number of bees. 
   - Therefore, the number of beetles = (2/3) * 9 = 6.

4. **Calculate the total number of animals:**
   - Total animals = Number of bees + Number of wasps + Number of rabbits + Number of beetles
   - Total animals = 9 (bees) + 24 (wasps) + 13 (rabbits) + 6 (beetles) = 52.

5. **Calculate the percentage of animals that are rabbits:**
   - Percentage of rabbits = (Number of rabbits / Total animals) * 100
   - Percentage of rabbits = (13 / 52) * 100 = 25%.

### Instructions:
1. Identify all the types of animals mentioned in the problem.
2. Calculate the number of each type of animal based on the relationships given.
3. Ensure to account for all animals when calculating the total.
4. Use the total to find the percentage of the specific type of animal in question.
5. Double-check calculations to ensure accuracy.

I answered the question incorrectly because I miscalculated the total number of animals in the plot and did not properly account for the number of rabbits. I also failed to correctly apply the information about the ratios and the total counts of different animals.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation of totals
- Incorrect application of ratios
- Oversight in counting specific animals

### Solution:
1. **Identify the number of bees and other animals:**
   - Number of bees = 9
   - Number of wasps = 24
   - Number of white animals = 26 (half of which are rabbits)

2. **Calculate the number of rabbits:**
   - Since half of the 26 white animals are rabbits, the number of rabbits = 26 / 2 = 13.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Mrs. Lee is looking for a new townhouse that will not go beyond her $340000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $400000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?",11000.0,"To determine how much more the total cost will be than Mrs. Lee's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the property after applying the discount and adding the brokerage and transfer fees.

1. **Calculate the discount on the selling price:**
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = 400,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 25\% \text{ of } 400,000 = 0.25 \times 400,000 = 100,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = 400,000 - 100,000 = 300,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee (5% of the selling price):**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 5\% \text{ of } 400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the transfer fee (12% of the selling price):**
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 12\% \text{ of } 400,000 = 0.12 \times 400,000 = 48,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Discounted Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 300,000 + 20,000 + 48,000 = 368,000
   \]

5. **Determine how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Lee's budget:**
   \[
   \text{Budget} = 340,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Budget} = 368,000 - 340,000 = 28,000
   \]

Thus, the total cost will be **$28,000** more than Mrs. Lee's budget.",28000.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Selling Price of the Property**: The selling price is $400,000.

2. **Discount Calculation**: Mrs. Lee can get a 25% discount on the selling price.
   - Discount amount = 25% of $400,000 = 0.25 * $400,000 = $100,000.
   - Selling price after discount = $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000.

3. **Brokerage Fee Calculation**: The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   - Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

4. **Transfer Fee Calculation**: The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.
   - Transfer fee = 12% of $400,000 = 0.12 * $400,000 = $48,000.

5. **Total Cost Calculation**: Now, we add the selling price after discount, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to find the total cost.
   - Total cost = Selling price after discount + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
   - Total cost = $300,000 + $20,000 + $48,000 = $368,000.

[Example Input]
Question: Sarah wants to buy a car that costs $25,000. She has a budget of $20,000. The dealership offers her a 10% discount on the car price, but she also needs to pay a sales tax of 8% on the final price after the discount. How much more will Sarah need to pay beyond her budget?

Wrong answer: I calculated the discount as $2,500, so the price after the discount is $22,500. Then, I calculated the sales tax as $1,800 (8% of $22,500), making the total cost $24,300. Since this is over her budget, I concluded that she needs $4,300 more.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total cost by not applying the sales tax correctly after the discount. I should have calculated the sales tax on the discounted price, but I mistakenly added it to the wrong base price.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect application of percentages
- Budget comparison error

Instructions:
1. Determine the discount amount by calculating the percentage of the original price.
2. Subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price.
3. Calculate the sales tax based on the discounted price.
4. Add the sales tax to the discounted price to find the total cost.
5. Compare the total cost to the budget to determine how much more is needed.

Advice:
- Always double-check the order of operations when applying discounts and taxes.
- Clearly define the base price for any percentage calculations.
- Keep track of your budget constraints throughout the calculation process.

Solution:
1. Discount: 10% of $25,000 = $2,500.
2. Discounted price: $25,000 - $2,500 = $22,500.
3. Sales tax: 8% of $22,500 = $1,800.
4. Total cost: $22,500 + $1,800 = $24,300.
5. Amount over budget: $24,300 - $20,000 = $4,300.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Mrs. Lee is looking for a new townhouse that will not go beyond her $340000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $400000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 28000.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I miscalculated the total cost by not properly accounting for the discount before applying the brokerage and transfer fees. I mistakenly added the fees to the original selling price instead of calculating them based on the discounted price.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect application of percentages
- Order of operations error

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the discount amount**: 
   - Discount: 25% of $400,000 = 0.25 * $400,000 = $100,000.

2. **Calculate the discounted price**: 
   - Discounted price: $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000.

3. **Calculate the brokerage fee**: 
   - Brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

4. **Calculate the transfer fee**: 
   - Transfer fee: 12% of $400,000 = 0.12 * $400,000 = $48,000.

5. **Calculate the total cost**: 
   - Total cost = Discounted price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
   - Total cost = $300,000 + $20,000 + $48,000 = $368,000.

6. **Determine how much more is needed beyond the budget**: 
   - Amount over budget = Total cost - Budget
   - Amount over budget = $368,000 - $340,000 = $28,000.

### Final Answer:
Mrs. Lee will need **$28,000** more than her budget.

### Instructions for Future Problems:
1. Identify the original selling price and the budget.
2. Calculate any discounts based on the original selling price.
3. Subtract the discount from the original selling price to find the discounted price.
4. Calculate any additional fees (brokerage, transfer, etc.) based on the original selling price, not the discounted price.
5. Add the discounted price and all fees to find the total cost.
6. Compare the total cost to the budget to determine how much more is needed.

### General Advice for Similar Problems:
- Always clarify which price (original or discounted) is used for percentage calculations.
- Keep track of all components of the total cost, including discounts and fees.
- Double-check calculations to ensure that all steps are followed in the correct order.","--- Beginning of the template ---

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Dr. Brown sold his villa for $550000. He paid the legal fees that amounted to 2% of the selling price and also paid a realtor fee that is 5% of the selling price. He also paid $440000 for the remaining loan amount on the villa, and $5000 for closing costs. Dr. Brown used the net proceeds from selling the villa to invest in stocks. The stocks gained 10% each year for two years. How much were Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years?",80465.0,"To find Dr. Brown's net proceeds after selling his villa and investing the money in stocks, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total selling costs (legal fees and realtor fees).**
2. **Determine the net proceeds from the sale of the villa.**
3. **Calculate the value of the investment in stocks after two years.**

### Step 1: Calculate Selling Costs

**Selling Price of the Villa:** $550,000

**Legal Fees:**  
Legal fees are 2% of the selling price.  
\[
\text{Legal Fees} = 0.02 \times 550,000 = 11,000
\]

**Realtor Fees:**  
Realtor fees are 5% of the selling price.  
\[
\text{Realtor Fees} = 0.05 \times 550,000 = 27,500
\]

**Total Selling Costs:**  
\[
\text{Total Selling Costs} = \text{Legal Fees} + \text{Realtor Fees} = 11,000 + 27,500 = 38,500
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Net Proceeds

**Amount Paid for Remaining Loan:** $440,000  
**Closing Costs:** $5,000  

**Total Costs:**  
\[
\text{Total Costs} = \text{Total Selling Costs} + \text{Remaining Loan} + \text{Closing Costs} = 38,500 + 440,000 + 5,000 = 483,500
\]

**Net Proceeds from Sale:**  
\[
\text{Net Proceeds} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Total Costs} = 550,000 - 483,500 = 66,500
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Value of Investment in Stocks After Two Years

Dr. Brown invests the net proceeds of $66,500 in stocks that gain 10% each year.

**Value After Year 1:**  
\[
\text{Value After Year 1} = \text{Initial Investment} \times (1 + \text{Rate}) = 66,500 \times (1 + 0.10) = 66,500 \times 1.10 = 73,150
\]

**Value After Year 2:**  
\[
\text{Value After Year 2} = \text{Value After Year 1} \times (1 + \text{Rate}) = 73,150 \times (1 + 0.10) = 73,150 \times 1.10 = 80,465
\]

### Final Result

Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years of investing in stocks is **$80,465**.",80465.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the legal fees:**
   - The selling price of the villa is $550,000.
   - The legal fees are 2% of the selling price.
   - Legal fees = 2% of $550,000 = 0.02 * 550,000 = $11,000.

2. **Calculate the realtor fee:**
   - The realtor fee is 5% of the selling price.
   - Realtor fee = 5% of $550,000 = 0.05 * 550,000 = $27,500.

3. **Calculate the total fees paid:**
   - Total fees = Legal fees + Realtor fee = $11,000 + $27,500 = $38,500.

4. **Calculate the remaining loan amount and closing costs:**
   - The remaining loan amount is $440,000.
   - Closing costs are $5,000.

5. **Calculate the total deductions from the selling price:**
   - Total deductions = Total fees + Remaining loan amount + Closing costs = $38,500 + $440,000 + $5,000 = $483,500.

6. **Calculate the net proceeds from selling the villa:**
   - Net proceeds = Selling price - Total deductions = $550,000 - $483,500 = $66,500.

7. **Calculate the investment growth over two years:**
   - The stocks gained 10% each year for two years.
   - After the first year, the value of the investment = $66,500 + (10% of $66,500) = $66,500 + 0.10 * 66,500 = $66,500 + $6,650 = $73,150.
   - After the second year, the value of the investment = $73,150 + (10% of $73,150) = $73,150 + 0.10 * 73,150 = $73,150 + $7,315 = $80,465.

An eighth of the tennis balls are indigo, and all except an eighth of those indigo balls are marked. How many marked balls are there in total?",16.0,"To find the total number of marked balls, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of balls**: The juggler can juggle 160 balls.

2. **Golf balls**: 
   - \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the balls are golf balls.
   - Number of golf balls = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 160 = 32 \).

3. **Tennis balls**: 
   - The rest are tennis balls.
   - Number of tennis balls = Total balls - Golf balls = \( 160 - 32 = 128 \).

4. **Marked golf balls**:
   - \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the golf balls are yellow.
   - Number of yellow golf balls = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 32 = 16 \).
   - \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the yellow golf balls are marked.
   - Number of marked yellow golf balls = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 16 = 2 \).

5. **Marked tennis balls**:
   - \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the tennis balls are indigo.
   - Number of indigo tennis balls = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 128 = 16 \).
   - All except \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the indigo balls are marked.
   - Number of unmarked indigo balls = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 16 = 2 \).
   - Therefore, the number of marked indigo balls = Total indigo balls - Unmarked indigo balls = \( 16 - 2 = 14 \).

6. **Total marked balls**:
   - Total marked balls = Marked yellow golf balls + Marked indigo tennis balls = \( 2 + 14 = 16 \).

Thus, the total number of marked balls is \( \boxed{16} \).",16.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. The juggler can juggle a total of 160 balls.
2. We need to find out how many of these are golf balls. According to the problem, 1/5 of the balls are golf balls.
   - So, the number of golf balls is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 160 = 32 \) golf balls.
3. The rest of the balls are tennis balls. To find the number of tennis balls, we subtract the number of golf balls from the total number of balls.
   - The number of tennis balls is \( 160 - 32 = 128 \) tennis balls.
4. Now, we need to find out how many of the golf balls are yellow. It states that 1/2 of the golf balls are yellow.
   - So, the number of yellow golf balls is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 32 = 16 \) yellow golf balls.
5. Out of the yellow golf balls, 1/8 are marked.
   - The number of marked yellow golf balls is \( \frac{1}{8} \times 16 = 2 \) marked yellow golf balls.
6. Next, we look at the tennis balls. It states that 1/8 of the tennis balls are indigo.
   - So, the number of indigo tennis balls is \( \frac{1}{8} \times 128 = 16 \) indigo tennis balls.
7. The problem states that all except 1/8 of the indigo balls are marked. This means that 1/8 of the indigo tennis balls are not marked.
   - The number of unmarked indigo tennis balls is \( \frac{1}{8} \times 16 = 2 \) unmarked indigo tennis balls.
8. Therefore, the number of marked indigo tennis balls is \( 16 - 2 = 14 \) marked indigo tennis balls.
9. Finally, we add the marked yellow golf balls and the marked indigo tennis balls to find the total number of marked balls.
   - The total number of marked balls is \( 2 + 14 = 16 \).

If there are one-fourth the number of boys in the park, what percentage of the kids in the park are girls?",80.0,"To find the percentage of kids in the park that are girls, we first need to determine the number of boys in the park.

We know that there are 16 girls, and the number of boys is one-fourth the number of girls. Therefore, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Number of girls} = \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4
\]

Now, we can find the total number of kids in the park by adding the number of girls and boys:

\[
\text{Total number of kids} = \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of boys} = 16 + 4 = 20
\]

Next, we calculate the percentage of kids that are girls:

\[
\text{Percentage of girls} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of girls}}{\text{Total number of kids}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Percentage of girls} = \left( \frac{16}{20} \right) \times 100
\]

Calculating the fraction:

\[
\frac{16}{20} = 0.8
\]

Now, multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

\[
0.8 \times 100 = 80
\]

Thus, the percentage of the kids in the park that are girls is:

\[
\boxed{80}
\]",80.0,1,"Let's think step by step.  
There are 16 girls in the park.  
The number of boys is one-fourth the number of girls.  
So, the number of boys is 16 / 4 = 4.  

Now, we can find the total number of kids in the park.  
Total kids = Number of girls + Number of boys = 16 + 4 = 20.  

Next, we need to find the percentage of kids in the park that are girls.  
The percentage of girls = (Number of girls / Total kids) * 100.  
So, the percentage of girls = (16 / 20) * 100 = 0.8 * 100 = 80%.

How much money does Priya have left?",492.0,"To find out how much money Priya has left after her purchases, we will calculate the total cost of each item she bought and then subtract that from the amount of money she started with.

1. **Cost of fudge:**
   - Priya bought 21 kgs of fudge.
   - The offer is ""Buy 15 kgs at ₺22 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/4 off.""
   - First, calculate the cost for the first 15 kgs:
     \[
     15 \text{ kgs} \times ₺22/\text{kg} = ₺330
     \]
   - Now, for the additional 6 kgs (21 kgs total - 15 kgs):
     - The first 4 kgs of the additional 6 kgs are at 1/4 off:
     - The price per kg for these 4 kgs is:
     \[
     ₺22 - \left(\frac{1}{4} \times ₺22\right) = ₺22 - ₺5.5 = ₺16.5/\text{kg}
     \]
     - So, the cost for these 4 kgs is:
     \[
     4 \text{ kgs} \times ₺16.5/\text{kg} = ₺66

3. **Cost of postcards:**
   - Priya bought 12 postcards at ₺21.0 each:
     \[
     12 \text{ postcards} \times ₺21.0/\text{postcard} = ₺252

   - First, calculate the cost for 15 kgs:
     - 15 kgs * ₺22/kg = ₺330.
   - Now, for the additional 4 kgs, we need to find the price after the discount:
     - The price for 4 kgs without discount is 4 kgs * ₺22/kg = ₺88.
     - The discount is 1/4 of ₺88, which is ₺88 * 1/4 = ₺22.
     - So, the price for 4 kgs after the discount is ₺88 - ₺22 = ₺66.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 21 kgs of fudge is:
     - ₺330 (for 15 kgs) + ₺66 (for 4 kgs) = ₺396.

3. Next, Priya buys a mixed bag of sand dollars for ₺11.0.

   - Now, we sum these numbers:
     \[
     131 + 47 + 702 = 880 \text{ total puppies}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of puppies with spots:**
   - Jamal's dog has 23 spotted puppies.
   - Gabriel's dog has 13 spotted puppies.
   - Yuki's dogs have:
     \[
     54 \times 13 = 702 \text{ puppies with spots}
     \]
   - Now, we sum these numbers:
     \[
     23 + 13 + 702 = 738 \text{ puppies with spots}
     \]

3. **Adjust for Jamal's unspotted puppies:**
   - Jamal has \( 131 - 23 = 108 \) unspotted puppies.
   - After the vet visit, half of these unspotted puppies are found to actually have spots:
     \[
     \frac{108}{2} = 54 \text{ additional spotted puppies}
     \]
   - Therefore, the new total of spotted puppies from Jamal is:
     \[
     23 + 54 = 77 \text{ spotted puppies}
     \]

4. **Recalculate the total number of puppies with spots:**
   - Now we recalculate the total number of puppies with spots:
     \[
     77 \text{ (Jamal)} + 13 \text{ (Gabriel)} + 702 \text{ (Yuki)} = 792 \text{ puppies with spots}
     \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of puppies with spots:**
   - The percentage of puppies with spots is given by:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Plugging in the numbers:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{792}{880} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Calculating this gives:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = 0.9 \times 100 = 90\%
     \]

Thus, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is \( \boxed{90} \).",90.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of puppies for each dog:**
   - Jamal's dog has 131 puppies.
   - Gabriel's dog has 47 puppies.
   - Yuki has 54 dogs, each with 13 puppies, so the total for Yuki is 54 * 13 = 702 puppies.

2. **Calculate the total number of puppies:**
   - Total puppies = Jamal's puppies + Gabriel's puppies + Yuki's puppies
   - Total puppies = 131 + 47 + 702 = 880 puppies.

3. **Calculate the number of spotted puppies:**
   - Jamal's spotted puppies = 23.
   - Gabriel's spotted puppies = 13.
   - Yuki's spotted puppies = 54 * 13 = 702 (since all of Yuki's puppies have spots).

4. **Calculate the total number of spotted puppies:**
   - Total spotted puppies = Jamal's spotted + Gabriel's spotted + Yuki's spotted
   - Total spotted puppies = 23 + 13 + 702 = 738 spotted puppies.

5. **Calculate the number of unspotted puppies for Jamal:**
   - Jamal's unspotted puppies = Total puppies - Spotted puppies
   - Jamal's unspotted puppies = 131 - 23 = 108 unspotted puppies.

6. **Determine how many of Jamal's unspotted puppies actually have spots:**
   - Half of Jamal's unspotted puppies have spots = 108 / 2 = 54.

7. **Calculate the new total number of spotted puppies:**
   - New total spotted puppies = Previous total spotted + Newly discovered spotted
   - New total spotted puppies = 738 + 54 = 792 spotted puppies.

8. **Calculate the percentage of puppies that have spots:**
   - Percentage of spotted puppies = (Total spotted puppies / Total puppies) * 100
   - Percentage of spotted puppies = (792 / 880) * 100.

9. **Calculate the percentage:**
   - Percentage of spotted puppies = 0.9 * 100 = 90%.

Since apples are a rare treat, he only buys four 3-kg boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys twelve 6-kg bags. Hay are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys thirty four 39-kg packs. Corn are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 17-kg sacks. Finally, he buys 43 kgs of groceries, and 27 kgs of tools, and 100 kgs of wood. A farm truck can carry 160 kgs at a time. If the farmer has three trucks, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the purchased items?",4.0,"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the purchased items, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the items he bought.

1. **Calculate the weight of apples:**

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Uma saw a 40-foot shark with 18 remoras, each 16 inches long attached to it. Then, 1/6 of the remoras swam away. Later, Uma saw another 10-foot shark with 6 remoras, each 8 inches long, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?",45.0,"To find the average percentage of each shark's body length that is covered by the remoras, we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert the lengths of the remoras from inches to feet.**
2. **Calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each shark.**
3. **Determine how many remoras remain after some swim away.**
4. **Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that is covered by the remaining remoras.**
5. **Find the average percentage for both sharks.**

### Step 1: Convert the lengths of the remoras to feet

- For the first shark, each remora is 16 inches long. 
  \[
  16 \text{ inches} = \frac{16}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 1.33 \text{ feet}
  \]

- For the second shark, each remora is 8 inches long.
  \[
  8 \text{ inches} = \frac{8}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 0.67 \text{ feet}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each shark

- For the first shark (40-foot shark with 18 remoras):
  \[
  \text{Total length of remoras} = 18 \times \frac{4}{3} = 24 \text{ feet}
  \]

- For the second shark (10-foot shark with 6 remoras):
  \[
  \text{Total length of remoras} = 6 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \text{ feet}
  \]

### Step 3: Determine how many remoras remain after some swim away

- For the first shark, \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the remoras swam away:
  \[
  \text{Number of remoras that swam away} = \frac{1}{6} \times 18 = 3
  \]
  \[
  \text{Remaining remoras} = 18 - 3 = 15
  \]

- For the second shark, all 6 remoras remain since none swam away.

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remaining remoras

- For the first shark:
  \[
  \text{Length of remaining remoras} = 15 \times \frac{4}{3} = 20 \text{ feet}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{20}{40} \right) \times 100 = 50\%
  \]

- For the second shark:
  \[
  \text{Length of remaining remoras} = 6 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \text{ feet}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{4}{10} \right) \times 100 = 40\%
  \]

### Step 5: Find the average percentage for both sharks

\[
\text{Average percentage} = \frac{50 + 40}{2} = \frac{90}{2} = 45\%
\]

Thus, the average percentage of each shark's body length that is covered by the remoras is **45%**.",45.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total length of the remoras on the first shark:**
   - There are 18 remoras, each 16 inches long.
   - Total length of remoras = 18 * 16 = 288 inches.

2. **Convert the shark's length from feet to inches:**
   - The first shark is 40 feet long.
   - 1 foot = 12 inches, so 40 feet = 40 * 12 = 480 inches.

3. **Calculate the percentage of the first shark's body length covered by the remoras:**
   - Percentage = (Total length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100
   - Percentage for the first shark = (288 / 480) * 100 = 60%.

4. **Calculate how many remoras swam away:**
   - 1/6 of the 18 remoras swam away.
   - Number of remoras that swam away = 18 / 6 = 3.
   - Remaining remoras = 18 - 3 = 15.

5. **Calculate the total length of the remaining remoras:**
   - Remaining remoras = 15, each 16 inches long.
   - Total length of remaining remoras = 15 * 16 = 240 inches.

6. **Calculate the percentage of the first shark's body length covered by the remaining remoras:**
   - Percentage for the remaining remoras = (240 / 480) * 100 = 50%.

7. **Now, calculate the total length of the remoras on the second shark:**
   - There are 6 remoras, each 8 inches long.
   - Total length of remoras = 6 * 8 = 48 inches.

8. **Convert the second shark's length from feet to inches:**
   - The second shark is 10 feet long.
   - 10 feet = 10 * 12 = 120 inches.

9. **Calculate the percentage of the second shark's body length covered by the remoras:**
   - Percentage for the second shark = (48 / 120) * 100 = 40%.

10. **Calculate the average percentage of both sharks' body lengths covered by the remoras:**
    - Average percentage = (Percentage of first shark + Percentage of second shark) / 2
    - Average percentage = (60 + 40) / 2 = 50%.

Carlos has 720 almonds, 7 bowls and 3 tables. Unfortunately, 2 tables break. Carlos then eats one-fifth of all the almonds. How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?",14.0,"To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the capacity of the bowls and tables.**
   - Each bowl can hold 24 almonds.
   - Each table can hold three times the amount of a bowl, which is:
     \[
     3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ almonds per table}
     \]

2. **Determine the total capacity of the bowls and tables before any tables break.**
   - Carlos has 7 bowls, so the total capacity of the bowls is:
     \[
     7 \times 24 = 168 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - Carlos has 3 tables, so the total capacity of the tables is:
     \[
     3 \times 72 = 216 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total capacity of all bowls and tables combined is:
     \[
     168 + 216 = 384 \text{ almonds}
     \]

3. **Account for the broken tables.**
   - After 2 tables break, Carlos has:
     \[
     3 - 2 = 1 \text{ table}
     \]
   - The capacity of the remaining table is:
     \[
     1 \times 72 = 72 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - Now, the total capacity with the remaining table is:
     \[
     168 + 72 = 240 \text{ almonds}
     \]

4. **Calculate how many almonds Carlos eats.**
   - Carlos has 720 almonds initially. He eats one-fifth of them:
     \[
     \frac{720}{5} = 144 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - Therefore, the remaining almonds after he eats is:
     \[
     720 - 144 = 576 \text{ almonds}
     \]

5. **Determine how many more bowls are needed to hold the remaining almonds.**
   - Carlos can currently hold 240 almonds with the bowls and the remaining table.
   - To find out how many more bowls are needed, we first need to find out how many bowls are required to hold 576 almonds:
     \[
     \text{Number of bowls needed} = \frac{576}{24} = 24 \text{ bowls}
     \]
   - Carlos already has 7 bowls, so the additional number of bowls needed is:
     \[
     24 - 7 = 17 \text{ bowls}
     \]

Thus, Carlos needs **17 more bowls** to place all the remaining almonds.",17.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the capacity of the tables**: 
   Each bowl can hold 24 almonds. 
   Each table can hold three times that, so:
   \[
   \text{Capacity of each table} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ almonds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the tables**: 
   Carlos has 3 tables, but 2 tables break, leaving him with 1 table. 
   Therefore, the total capacity of the remaining table is:
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of 1 table} = 72 \text{ almonds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls**: 
   Carlos has 7 bowls, and each bowl holds 24 almonds. 
   So, the total capacity of the bowls is:
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of bowls} = 7 \times 24 = 168 \text{ almonds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total capacity of bowls and tables combined**: 
   The total capacity of the bowls and the remaining table is:
   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = 168 + 72 = 240 \text{ almonds}
   \]

5. **Determine how many almonds Carlos has after eating**: 
   Carlos starts with 720 almonds and eats one-fifth of them. 
   First, calculate one-fifth of 720:
   \[
   \text{Almonds eaten} = \frac{720}{5} = 144 \text{ almonds}
   \]
   Now, subtract the almonds eaten from the total:
   \[
   \text{Remaining almonds} = 720 - 144 = 576 \text{ almonds}
   \]

6. **Determine how many more bowls are needed**: 
   We know the total capacity of the bowls and the remaining table is 240 almonds, but Carlos has 576 almonds. 
   To find out how many more bowls are needed, we first need to find out how many bowls are required to hold 576 almonds:
   \[
   \text{Bowls needed} = \frac{576}{24} = 24 \text{ bowls}
   \]

7. **Calculate how many more bowls Carlos needs**: 
   Carlos currently has 7 bowls, so the number of additional bowls needed is:
   \[
   \text{Additional bowls needed} = 24 - 7 = 17 \text{ bowls}
   \]

[Example Input]
Question: Sarah has 500 marbles. She places them into bags, each bag can hold 25 marbles. If she gives away 4 bags of marbles, how many more bags does she need to hold the remaining marbles?
Wrong answer: I calculated that Sarah has 20 bags and after giving away 4 bags, she has 16 bags left. I thought she needed no more bags since she had 16 left, but I forgot to calculate how many marbles were left after giving away the bags.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of remaining marbles after giving away the bags and did not consider how many bags were needed for those remaining marbles.
Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Ignoring remaining quantity
- Incorrect assumption about sufficiency
Instructions:
1. Calculate the total number of marbles Sarah has.
2. Determine how many marbles are in each bag.
3. Calculate how many bags Sarah can fill with her marbles.
4. Subtract the number of bags given away from the total bags.
5. Calculate the number of marbles left after giving away the bags.
6. Determine how many additional bags are needed for the remaining marbles.
Advice:
- Always keep track of quantities after each operation.
- Double-check calculations for remaining quantities.
- Ensure to consider all parts of the problem, including what happens after giving away or using items.
Solution:
Sarah has 500 marbles. She can fill 20 bags (500 ÷ 25 = 20). After giving away 4 bags, she has 16 bags left, but she has given away 100 marbles (4 bags × 25 marbles/bag). This leaves her with 400 marbles (500 - 100 = 400). To hold the remaining 400 marbles, she needs 16 more bags (400 ÷ 25 = 16). Therefore, she needs 16 additional bags to hold the remaining marbles.

Unfortunately, 2 tables break. Carlos then eats one-fifth of all the almonds. How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 17.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of remaining almonds after Carlos ate one-fifth of them and did not properly account for the capacity of the bowls and tables after the breakage. I also failed to correctly determine how many bowls were needed for the remaining almonds.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Ignoring remaining quantity
- Incorrect assumption about sufficiency
- Failure to account for breakage

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the total number of almonds Carlos has:**
   - Carlos has 720 almonds.

2. **Determine the capacity of each bowl and table:**
   - Each bowl can hold 24 almonds.
   - Each table can hold three times that, so each table can hold \(3 \times 24 = 72\) almonds.

3. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and tables:**
   - Carlos has 7 bowls, so the total capacity of the bowls is:
     \[
     7 \text{ bowls} \times 24 \text{ almonds/bowl} = 168 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - Carlos has 3 tables, but 2 break, leaving him with 1 table. The total capacity of the remaining table is:
     \[
     1 \text{ table} \times 72 \text{ almonds/table} = 72 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total capacity of the bowls and remaining table is:
     \[
     168 \text{ almonds (bowls)} + 72 \text{ almonds (table)} = 240 \text{ almonds}
     \]

4. **Calculate how many almonds Carlos eats:**
   - Carlos eats one-fifth of all the almonds:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} \times 720 = 144 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - The remaining almonds after Carlos eats are:
     \[
     720 - 144 = 576 \text{ almonds}
     \]

5. **Determine how many more bowls are needed for the remaining almonds:**
   - The total capacity of the bowls and the remaining table is 240 almonds, but Carlos has 576 almonds left.
   - The number of additional bowls needed can be calculated as follows:
     - First, calculate how many bowls are needed for 576 almonds:
     \[
     \text{Bowls needed} = \frac{576 \text{ almonds}}{24 \text{ almonds/bowl}} = 24 \text{ bowls}
     \]
   - Since Carlos already has 7 bowls, the additional bowls needed are:
     \[
     24 \text{ bowls} - 7 \text{ bowls} = 17 \text{ additional bowls}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Carlos needs **17 more bowls** to place all the remaining almonds.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I miscalculated the total number of almonds remaining after Carlos ate one-fifth of them. I also failed to accurately determine how many almonds could be stored in the remaining bowls after accounting for the broken tables.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect subtraction
- Misunderstanding of capacity
- Incorrect division

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the total capacity of the tables:**
   - Each bowl holds 24 almonds.
   - Each table can hold three times that: \( 3 \times 24 = 72 \) almonds per table.
   - Carlos has 3 tables, but 2 break, leaving him with 1 table.
   - Total capacity of 1 table: \( 72 \) almonds.
   - Total capacity of 7 bowls: \( 7 \times 24 = 168 \) almonds.
   - Total capacity of remaining bowls and tables: \( 168 + 72 = 240 \) almonds.

2. **Calculate how many almonds Carlos eats:**
   - Carlos has 720 almonds initially.
   - He eats one-fifth of them: \( \frac{720}{5} = 144 \) almonds.
   - Remaining almonds after eating: \( 720 - 144 = 576 \) almonds.

3. **Determine if the remaining capacity is sufficient:**
   - Total capacity of bowls and tables is 240 almonds.
   - Remaining almonds (576) exceed the total capacity (240).

4. **Calculate how many more bowls are needed:**
   - Determine how many bowls are needed to hold 576 almonds:
   - Each bowl holds 24 almonds, so the number of bowls required: \( \frac{576}{24} = 24 \) bowls.
   - Carlos already has 7 bowls, so the additional bowls needed: \( 24 - 7 = 17 \) bowls.

### Final Answer:
Carlos needs **17 more bowls** to place all the remaining almonds.

### Instructions for Future Problems:
1. Identify the total number of items (almonds).

Diego's brother, Esteban, is 6 years younger than Diego, and Aisha sister Nadia is 10 years older than Esteban. What will be the average of all four in 4 years?",25.0,"To solve the problem, we will first determine the ages of Diego, Aisha, Esteban, and Nadia at the relevant times, and then calculate the average of their ages in 4 years.

1. **Diego's current age**: 
   - Diego is currently 19 years old.

2. **Aisha's age in 9 years**: 
   - In 9 years, Diego will be \(19 + 9 = 28\) years old.
   - According to the problem, Aisha will be 2 times Diego's current age in 9 years. Diego's current age is 19, so:
   \[
   \text{Aisha's age in 9 years} = 2 \times 19 = 38 \text{ years old}
   \]
   - Therefore, Aisha's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Aisha's current age} = 38 - 9 = 29 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Esteban's age**: 
   - Esteban is 6 years younger than Diego, so:
   \[
   \text{Esteban's current age} = 19 - 6 = 13 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Nadia's age**: 
   - Nadia is 10 years older than Esteban, so:
   \[
   \text{Nadia's current age} = 13 + 10 = 23 \text{ years old}
   \]

Now we have the current ages of all four individuals:
- Diego: 19 years
- Aisha: 29 years
- Esteban: 13 years
- Nadia: 23 years

5. **Ages in 4 years**:
   - Diego's age in 4 years: \(19 + 4 = 23\)
   - Aisha's age in 4 years: \(29 + 4 = 33\)
   - Esteban's age in 4 years: \(13 + 4 = 17\)
   - Nadia's age in 4 years: \(23 + 4 = 27\)

6. **Calculating the average age in 4 years**:
   - First, we sum their ages in 4 years:
   \[
   23 + 33 + 17 + 27 = 100
   \]
   - Now, we divide by the number of individuals (4) to find the average:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{100}{4} = 25
   \]

Thus, the average age of Diego, Aisha, Esteban, and Nadia in 4 years will be \( \boxed{25} \).",25.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Diego's current age**: Diego is 19 years old.

2. **Aisha's age in 9 years**: In 9 years, Aisha will be 2 times as old as Diego is now. Since Diego is currently 19, Aisha will be:
   \[
   2 \times 19 = 38 \text{ years old in 9 years.}
   \]

3. **Aisha's current age**: To find Aisha's current age, we subtract 9 years from her age in 9 years:
   \[
   38 - 9 = 29 \text{ years old.}
   \]

4. **Esteban's age**: Esteban is 6 years younger than Diego. Therefore, Esteban's current age is:
   \[
   19 - 6 = 13 \text{ years old.}

5. **Nadia's age**: Nadia is 10 years older than Esteban. So, Nadia's current age is:
   \[
   13 + 10 = 23 \text{ years old.}

   - Aisha: \(29 + 4 = 33\)
   - Esteban: \(13 + 4 = 17\)
   - Nadia: \(23 + 4 = 27\)

7. **Total age in 4 years**: Now, we add their ages in 4 years:
   \[
   23 + 33 + 17 + 27 = 100

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Keisha is knitting winter wear for her 4 grandchildren. They're quadruplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a shawl, sweater, poncho, gloves, and mittens for each of them. It takes 5 skeins of wool to make a shawl, 6 for a sweater, 8 for a poncho, 8 for a pair of gloves, and 14 for a pair of mittens. Keisha wants to make two warm jackets for herself, each needing 8 skeins of wool. Each dozen skeins of wool costs $7. The store has a promotion where customers receive a $20 discount on purchases over $100. How much should Keisha pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?",85.0,"To find out how much Keisha should pay for all the skeins of wool she needs, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed for the grandchildren's items.**
   - **Shawl:** 5 skeins per shawl × 4 grandchildren = 20 skeins
   - **Sweater:** 6 skeins per sweater × 4 grandchildren = 24 skeins
   - **Poncho:** 8 skeins per poncho × 4 grandchildren = 32 skeins
   - **Gloves:** 8 skeins per pair of gloves × 4 grandchildren = 32 skeins
   - **Mittens:** 14 skeins per pair of mittens × 4 grandchildren = 56 skeins

   Now, we sum these amounts:
   \[
   20 + 24 + 32 + 32 + 56 = 164 \text{ skeins}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed for Keisha's jackets.**
   - Each jacket requires 8 skeins, and she wants to make 2 jackets:
   \[
   8 \text{ skeins/jacket} × 2 \text{ jackets} = 16 \text{ skeins}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed overall.**
   \[
   164 \text{ skeins (for grandchildren)} + 16 \text{ skeins (for jackets)} = 180 \text{ skeins}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the skeins of wool.**
   - Each dozen skeins costs $7. First, we need to find out how many dozens are in 180 skeins:
   \[
   \frac{180 \text{ skeins}}{12 \text{ skeins/dozen}} = 15 \text{ dozens}
   \]
   - Now, we calculate the cost:
   \[
   15 \text{ dozens} × 7 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 105 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Apply the discount if applicable.**
   - Since the total cost of $105 is over $100, Keisha qualifies for a $20 discount:
   \[
   105 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 85 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Keisha should pay for all the skeins of wool she needs is **$85**.",85.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed for the grandchildren:**
   - For each grandchild, the wool needed is:
     - Shawl: 5 skeins
     - Sweater: 6 skeins
     - Poncho: 8 skeins
     - Gloves: 8 skeins
     - Mittens: 14 skeins
   - Total for one grandchild: 
     \( 5 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 14 = 41 \) skeins.
   - Since there are 4 grandchildren:
     \( 41 \times 4 = 164 \) skeins.

2. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed for Keisha:**
   - For herself, she wants to make 2 jackets, each needing 8 skeins:
     \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \) skeins.

3. **Calculate the overall total skeins of wool needed:**
   - Total skeins for grandchildren + Total skeins for Keisha:
     \( 164 + 16 = 180 \) skeins.

4. **Calculate the cost of the skeins of wool:**
   - Each dozen skeins costs $7. 
   - First, find out how many dozens are in 180 skeins:
     \( 180 \div 12 = 15 \) dozens.
   - Now, calculate the cost:
     \( 15 \times 7 = 105 \) dollars.

5. **Check if the discount applies:**
   - The total cost is $105, which is over $100, so Keisha qualifies for the $20 discount.

6. **Calculate the final amount to pay:**

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,Mohammed goes to the store to buy some rice. The normal brand of rice he buys costs ¥15 per kg. He has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 3 kgs of rice per day. The store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs; any additional rice is sold at the regular price. Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2. How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,"To find out how much Mohammed has to pay, we can break down the problem into several steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of rice Mohammed needs for a week:**
   - Mohammed uses 3 kg of rice per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he needs:
     \[
     3 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 21 \, \text{kg}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost of the more expensive brand of rice:**
   - The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg.
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more:
     \[
     \text{Cost of more expensive brand} = 15 + (0.20 \times 15) = 15 + 3 = ¥18 \, \text{per kg}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the first 10 kg of rice with the discount:**
   - The store has a 40% discount on rice up to 10 kg.
   - The discounted price per kg is:
     \[
     \text{Discounted price} = 18 - (0.40 \times 18) = 18 - 7.2 = ¥10.8 \, \text{per kg}
     \]
   - The cost for the first 10 kg is:
     \[
     10 \, \text{kg} \times 10.8 \, \text{¥/kg} = ¥108
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the remaining rice (11 kg) at the regular price:**
   - The remaining amount of rice is:
     \[
     21 \, \text{kg} - 10 \, \text{kg} = 11 \, \text{kg}
     \]
   - The cost for the remaining 11 kg at the regular price of ¥18 per kg is:
     \[
     11 \, \text{kg} \times 18 \, \text{¥/kg} = ¥198
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the rice:**
   - The total cost of the rice is:
     \[
     ¥108 + ¥198 = ¥306
     \]

6. **Add the cost of the bagel:**
   - The cost of the bagel is ¥2.
   - Therefore, the total amount Mohammed has to pay is:
     \[
     ¥306 + ¥2 = ¥308
     \]

Thus, the total amount Mohammed has to pay is **¥308**.",308.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice:**
   - The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg.
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more.
   - 20% of ¥15 is \( 0.20 \times 15 = ¥3 \).
   - Therefore, the cost of the more expensive brand is \( 15 + 3 = ¥18 \) per kg.

2. **Calculate the total amount of rice Mohammed needs for a week:**
   - Mohammed uses 3 kgs of rice per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he needs \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) kgs of rice.

3. **Calculate the cost of the first 10 kgs of rice with the discount:**
   - The store has a 40% discount on the first 10 kgs.
   - The cost of 10 kgs at ¥18 per kg is \( 10 \times 18 = ¥180 \).
   - The discount is \( 40\% \) of ¥180, which is \( 0.40 \times 180 = ¥72 \).
   - Therefore, the cost after the discount for the first 10 kgs is \( 180 - 72 = ¥108 \).

4. **Calculate the cost of the remaining rice:**
   - Mohammed needs a total of 21 kgs, and he has already bought 10 kgs.
   - The remaining rice he needs is \( 21 - 10 = 11 \) kgs.
   - The cost of the remaining 11 kgs at the regular price of ¥18 per kg is \( 11 \times 18 = ¥198 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the rice:**
   - The total cost for the rice is the cost of the first 10 kgs plus the cost of the remaining 11 kgs:
   - Total cost = \( 108 + 198 = ¥306 \).

6. **Add the cost of the bagel:**
   - The cost of the bagel is ¥2.
   - Therefore, the total amount Mohammed has to pay is \( 306 + 2 = ¥308 \).

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Jasmine and Mia are sisters from Nairobi who love collecting signatures from authors. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Jasmine and Mia compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Jasmine has 36 signatures in her book, and Mia has 31. The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,"To find out how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week to reach their goal of 145 signatures, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total signatures they currently have:**
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   - Mia has 31 signatures.
   - Total signatures = 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

2. **Determine how many more signatures they need to reach their goal:**
   - Their goal is 145 signatures.
   - Signatures needed = 145 - 67 = 78 signatures.

3. **Determine Jasmine's collection over the next 2 weeks:**
   - Jasmine's current weekly collection is not explicitly given, but we know that she will collect 5 fewer signatures per week than she normally would.
   - Let's denote Jasmine's normal weekly collection as \( J \).
   - In the next 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect signatures only on weekends, which means she will collect \( J - 5 \) signatures each week.
   - Therefore, over 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect \( 2(J - 5) = 2J - 10 \) signatures.

4. **Determine Mia's collection over the next 2 weeks:**
   - Let Mia's weekly collection be \( M \).
   - Over 2 weeks, Mia will collect \( 2M \) signatures.

5. **Set up the equation for the total signatures collected in the next 2 weeks:**
   - The total signatures collected by both sisters in the next 2 weeks should equal the signatures needed to reach their goal:
   \[
   (2J - 10) + 2M = 78
   \]

6. **Rearranging the equation:**
   \[
   2M = 78 - (2J - 10)
   \]
   \[
   2M = 78 - 2J + 10
   \]
   \[
   2M = 88 - 2J
   \]
   \[
   M = 44 - J
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Mia needs to collect \( 44 - J \) signatures per week, where \( J \) is Jasmine's normal weekly collection.
   - Since we do not have the exact value of \( J \), we can express Mia's required collection in terms of Jasmine's normal collection.

If we assume Jasmine's normal weekly collection \( J \) is a reasonable number (for example, if we assume she normally collects 15 signatures per week), we can calculate Mia's required collection:

- If \( J = 15 \):
  \[
  M = 44 - 15 = 29
  \]

Thus, if Jasmine normally collects 15 signatures per week, Mia would need to collect 29 signatures per week to reach their goal of 145 signatures. 

You can adjust \( J \) based on any reasonable assumption about Jasmine's normal collection rate to find Mia's required collection rate.",145.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Current Signatures**: 
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   - Mia has 31 signatures.
   - Together, they have 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

2. **Goal**: 
   - They want to reach a total of 145 signatures.

3. **Signatures Needed**: 
   - To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the current total from their goal:
   - 145 - 67 = 78 signatures needed.

4. **Remaining Time**: 
   - They have 2 more weeks of spring break.

5. **Jasmine's Collection**: 
   - Jasmine can only collect signatures on weekends, and her weekly collection is reduced by 5 signatures per week.
   - Let's assume Jasmine originally collected \( x \) signatures per week. Therefore, her new collection per week is \( x - 5 \).
   - Over 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect \( 2(x - 5) \) signatures.

6. **Mia's Collection**: 
   - Let \( y \) be the number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week.
   - Over 2 weeks, Mia will collect \( 2y \) signatures.

7. **Total Signatures Collected in 2 Weeks**: 
   - The total signatures collected by both sisters in the remaining 2 weeks will be:
   - \( 2(x - 5) + 2y \).

8. **Setting Up the Equation**: 
   - We know that the total signatures collected in the remaining 2 weeks must equal the signatures needed:
   - \( 2(x - 5) + 2y = 78 \).

9. **Simplifying the Equation**: 
   - Dividing the entire equation by 2 gives:
   - \( x - 5 + y = 39 \).

10. **Finding Mia's Weekly Collection**: 
    - Rearranging the equation to solve for \( y \):
    - \( y = 39 - (x - 5) \).
    - This simplifies to \( y = 39 - x + 5 \) or \( y = 44 - x \).

11. **Conclusion**: 
    - Mia needs to collect \( 44 - x \) signatures per week, where \( x \) is Jasmine's original weekly collection. 
    - Since we don't have the exact value of \( x \), we can conclude that Mia's required collection depends on Jasmine's original collection rate.

The answer is that Mia needs to collect \( 44 - x \) signatures per week, where \( x \) is Jasmine's original weekly collection.",44.0,0,1,0,24.0,"--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

[Example Input]
Question: Alex and Jordan are friends who enjoy playing video games. Over the course of 4 weeks, they keep track of how many games they complete. Alex finishes 20 games, while Jordan finishes 15. They have 3 more weeks to play and want to complete a total of 60 games together. However, Alex can only complete 3 games per week during the remaining weeks, while Jordan plans to double his weekly completion rate. How many games does Jordan need to complete per week to reach their goal?

Wrong answer: I calculated that Jordan needs to complete 10 games per week. I mistakenly thought that Alex's completion rate would not affect the total needed.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total number of games needed by not considering Alex's contribution correctly. I also failed to account for the total number of games they had already completed.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Misunderstanding of contributions
- Incorrect assumptions about rates

Instructions:
1. Identify the total number of games already completed by both players.
2. Determine the total number of games they want to complete.
3. Calculate how many games are left to reach the goal.
4. Assess each player's contribution based on their rates for the remaining weeks.
5. Set up an equation to find out how many games Jordan needs to complete per week.

Advice:
- Always double-check the contributions of all parties involved in a problem.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion.
- Clearly define the rates of change for each individual before proceeding with calculations.

Solution:
Alex has completed 20 games and Jordan has completed 15, totaling 35 games. They want to reach 60 games, so they need 25 more games. Alex can complete 3 games per week for 3 weeks, totaling 9 games. Therefore, Jordan needs to complete 25 - 9 = 16 games in 3 weeks, which means he needs to complete approximately 5.33 games per week. Since he can't complete a fraction of a game, he needs to complete at least 6 games per week to reach their goal.

   - Jasmine can collect signatures only on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 signatures. Assuming she originally collected a certain number of signatures per week, we need to determine how many she can collect in 2 weeks.
   - Let’s assume Jasmine originally collected \( x \) signatures per week. Therefore, her new collection rate is \( x - 5 \).
   - In 2 weeks, she will collect \( 2(x - 5) \).

5. **Set up the equation for Mia's collection:**
   - Let \( y \) be the number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week.
   - In 2 weeks, Mia will collect \( 2y \) signatures.
   - The total signatures collected by both sisters in the remaining 2 weeks must equal the signatures needed:
   \[
   2(x - 5) + 2y = 78
   \]

6. **Assuming Jasmine originally collected 20 signatures per week:**
   - Then her new collection rate is \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) signatures per week.
   - In 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \) signatures.

7. **Substituting into the equation:**
   \[
   30 + 2y = 78
   \]
   \[
   2y = 78 - 30
   \]
   \[
   2y = 48
   \]
   \[
   y = 24
   \]

### Final Answer:
Mia needs to collect **24 signatures per week** to ensure they reach their goal.

[Example Input]
Question: Alex and Jordan are friends who enjoy playing video games. Over the course of 4 weeks, they keep track of how many games they complete. Alex finishes 20 games, while Jordan finishes 15. They have 3 more weeks to play and want to complete a total of 60 games together. However, Alex can only complete 3 games per week during the remaining weeks, while Jordan plans to double his weekly completion rate. How many games does Jordan need to complete per week to reach their goal?

Wrong answer: I calculated that Jordan needs to complete 10 games per week. I mistakenly thought that Alex's completion rate would not affect the total needed.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total number of games needed by not considering Alex's contribution correctly. I also failed to account for the total number of games they had already completed.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Misunderstanding of contributions
- Incorrect assumptions about rates

Instructions:
1. Identify the total number of games already completed by both players.
2. Determine the total number of games they want to complete.
3. Calculate how many games are left to reach the goal.
4. Assess each player's contribution based on their rates for the remaining weeks.
5. Set up an equation to find out how many games Jordan needs to complete per week.

Advice:
- Always double-check the contributions of all parties involved in a problem.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion.
- Clearly define the rates of change for each individual before proceeding with calculations.

Solution:
Alex has completed 20 games and Jordan has completed 15, totaling 35 games. They want to reach 60 games, so they need 25 more games. Alex can complete 3 games per week for 3 weeks, totaling 9 games. Therefore, Jordan needs to complete 25 - 9 = 16 games in 3 weeks, which means he needs to complete approximately 5.33 games per week. Since he can't complete a fraction of a game, he needs to complete at least 6 games per week to reach their goal.

Question: Alex and Jamie are friends who enjoy playing video games. Over the summer, they decide to keep track of their high scores. After 4 weeks, Alex has a score of 1200 points, and Jamie has a score of 1500 points. They have 3 more weeks to improve their scores and want to reach a combined total of 5000 points. Alex can only increase his score by 100 points per week, while Jamie can increase hers by 200 points per week. How many points does Jamie need to score each week to ensure they reach their goal?

Wrong answer: I calculated that Jamie needs to score 300 points per week. I mistakenly added their current scores and subtracted from the goal without considering how much each could increase their scores.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total points needed by not properly accounting for the individual score increases over the remaining weeks. I also failed to set up the equation correctly to find Jamie's required weekly score.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect equation setup
- Ignoring individual contributions

Instructions:
1. Identify the current scores of both individuals.
2. Determine the total score needed to reach the goal.
3. Calculate how much each individual can increase their score over the remaining weeks.
4. Set up an equation to find the required score for the individual who needs to increase their score.
5. Solve the equation step-by-step to find the answer.

Advice:
- Always double-check your calculations and ensure you account for all variables.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion.
- Write out the equations clearly to visualize the relationships between the variables.

Solution:
Alex currently has 1200 points and can increase by 100 points per week for 3 weeks, totaling 300 points. Jamie currently has 1500 points and can increase by 200 points per week for 3 weeks, totaling 600 points. Together, they can increase their scores by 900 points, bringing their total to 3900 points. To reach 5000 points, they need an additional 1100 points. Since Alex can only contribute 300 points, Jamie must cover the remaining 800 points. Therefore, Jamie needs to score approximately 267 points per week (800 points / 3 weeks) to ensure they reach their goal.

I initially miscalculated the total number of signatures needed and did not properly account for Jasmine's reduced collection rate. I also failed to set up the equation correctly to find Mia's required weekly collection.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect equation setup
- Ignoring individual collection rates

### Solution:
1. **Identify Current Signatures:**
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   - Mia has 31 signatures.
   - Total signatures currently = 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

2. **Determine Total Signatures Needed:**
   - They want to reach a combined total of 145 signatures.
   - Signatures needed = 145 - 67 = 78 signatures.

3. **Calculate Jasmine's Contribution:**
   - Jasmine can collect signatures for 2 weeks but loses 5 signatures per week.
   - If she normally collects \( x \) signatures per week, her effective collection will be \( x - 5 \).
   - Total signatures Jasmine can collect in 2 weeks = \( 2(x - 5) \).

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( y \) be the number of signatures Mia collects per week.
   - Total signatures Mia can collect in 2 weeks = \( 2y \).
   - The equation for total signatures becomes:
     \[
     2(x - 5) + 2y = 78
     \]

5. **Assuming Jasmine's Normal Collection Rate:**
   - If we assume Jasmine normally collects 20 signatures per week (as an example), then:
     \[
     2(20 - 5) + 2y = 78
     \]
     \[
     2(15) + 2y = 78
     \]
     \[
     30 + 2y = 78
     \]
     \[
     2y = 48
     \]
     \[
     y = 24
     \]

6. **Final Calculation:**
   - Mia needs to collect **24 signatures per week** to ensure they reach their goal.

### Instructions:
1. Identify the current totals for each individual.
2. Determine the total goal and how many signatures are needed.
3. Calculate how many signatures each individual can collect based on their rates and time remaining.
4. Set up an equation that combines both individuals' contributions to meet the goal.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation of total signatures needed
- Incorrect equation setup
- Neglecting variable changes

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the total signatures needed**: 
   - Current total signatures = Jasmine's signatures + Mia's signatures = 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.
   - Total signatures needed = 145 signatures.
   - Signatures still needed = 145 - 67 = 78 signatures.

2. **Determine Jasmine's contribution**:
   - Jasmine can only collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 signatures. 
   - Assuming she normally collects \( x \) signatures per week, her new collection rate is \( x - 5 \).
   - In 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect \( 2(x - 5) \) signatures.

3. **Set up the equation**:
   - Let Mia's weekly collection be \( y \).
   - In 2 weeks, Mia will collect \( 2y \) signatures.
   - The total signatures collected by both sisters in the remaining weeks must equal the signatures still needed:

Thus, after reaching the gym for the second time, Sofia and Benjamin have **110 minutes** left to get to the mall without being late.",110.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Sofia and Benjamin have a total of 246 minutes to walk to the mall.
2. It takes them 16 minutes to get to the corner where the cinema is.
3. After that, it takes them another 52 minutes to get to the gym.
4. So, the total time taken to reach the gym the first time is:
   \[
   16 + 52 = 68 \text{ minutes}
   \]
5. After reaching the gym, they realize they forgot their wallets and need to return home. The time taken to return home is the same as the time taken to get to the gym, which is 52 minutes.
6. So, the time taken to return home is 52 minutes.
7. Now, they need to walk back to the gym again, which takes another 52 minutes.
8. Therefore, the total time spent for the round trip (to the gym and back home, then back to the gym) is:
   \[
   52 + 52 = 104 \text{ minutes}
   \]
9. Adding the time taken to reach the gym the first time (68 minutes) to the round trip time (104 minutes):
   \[
   68 + 104 = 172 \text{ minutes}
   \]
10. Now, we need to find out how much time they have left to get to the mall. They started with 246 minutes, so the time remaining is:
    \[
    246 - 172 = 74 \text{ minutes}
    \]
11. They still need to walk from the gym to the mall. We need to determine how long that walk takes. However, since the question does not provide the time it takes to walk from the gym to the mall, we can only conclude that they have 74 minutes left after their round trip.

The answer is that they have 74 minutes left to get to the mall without being late.",74.0,0,1,0,110.0,"--- Beginning of the template ---

[Example Input]
Question: Emma and Liam have 300 minutes to reach a concert starting from their house. It takes them 20 minutes to walk to the park. After that, it takes them another 40 minutes to get to the library. When they arrive at the library, they realize they left their tickets at home, so they must return to get them and then walk back to the library. Once they reach the library for the second time, how much time do they have left to get to the concert without being late?
Wrong answer: I calculated that they have 300 - (20 + 40 + 20 + 40) = 180 minutes left, but I forgot to account for the time spent returning to the library and the time to get back to the library again, which is an additional 80 minutes.
---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total time spent by not including the return trips to the house and back to the library, which added an extra 80 minutes to the total time used.
Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Time management
- Return trips
Instructions:
1. Identify the total time available (300 minutes).
2. Calculate the time taken to walk to the park (20 minutes).
3. Calculate the time taken to walk to the library (40 minutes).
4. Add the time taken to return home (20 minutes) and the time taken to walk back to the library (40 minutes).
5. Subtract the total time spent from the total time available to find the remaining time.
6. Ensure all segments of the journey are accounted for.
Advice:
- Always break down the problem into smaller segments to ensure all time is accounted for.
- Double-check calculations, especially when there are return trips involved.
- Keep track of the total time spent at each stage of the journey.
Solution:
The correct reasoning is: Total time spent = 20 + 40 + 20 + 40 = 120 minutes. Remaining time = 300 - 120 = 180 minutes. They have 180 minutes left to get to the concert without being late.

### Solution:
1. **Identify the total time available**: 246 minutes.
2. **Calculate the time taken to walk to the cinema**: 16 minutes.
3. **Calculate the time taken to walk to the gym**: 52 minutes.
4. **Calculate the time taken to return home**: 16 minutes (the same time it took to get to the cinema).
5. **Calculate the time taken to walk back to the gym**: 52 minutes (the same time it took to get to the gym).
6. **Total time spent**:
   - Time to cinema: 16 minutes
   - Time to gym: 52 minutes
   - Time to return home: 16 minutes
   - Time to return to gym: 52 minutes
   - Total time spent = 16 + 52 + 16 + 52 = 136 minutes.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Leon wants to make different sized ice cubes with 312 ounces of water. He can make giant cubes that use 12 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 5 ounces, small cubes that use 1/2 of a ounce, and tiny cubes that are half the size of small cubes. He makes 48 total ice cubes, including 10 giant cubes, 14 small cubes, 12 medium cubes, and some tiny cubes. How many ounces of water does Leon have left?",122.0,"To find out how many ounces of water Leon has left after making the ice cubes, we first need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of ice cube he made.

1. **Giant Cubes**:
   - Number of giant cubes = 10
   - Water used per giant cube = 12 ounces
   - Total water used for giant cubes = \(10 \times 12 = 120\) ounces

2. **Medium Cubes**:
   - Number of medium cubes = 12
   - Water used per medium cube = 5 ounces
   - Total water used for medium cubes = \(12 \times 5 = 60\) ounces

3. **Small Cubes**:
   - Number of small cubes = 14
   - Water used per small cube = 0.5 ounces
   - Total water used for small cubes = \(14 \times 0.5 = 7\) ounces

4. **Tiny Cubes**:
   - Let \(x\) be the number of tiny cubes.
   - Water used per tiny cube = \(0.5 \div 2 = 0.25\) ounces
   - Total water used for tiny cubes = \(x \times 0.25\) ounces

Now, we know that the total number of ice cubes is 48. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
10 + 12 + 14 + x = 48
\]

Calculating the left side:

\[
36 + x = 48
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = 48 - 36 = 12
\]

So, Leon made 12 tiny cubes.

Now we can calculate the total water used for the tiny cubes:

\[
\text{Total water used for tiny cubes} = 12 \times 0.25 = 3 \text{ ounces}
\]

Next, we sum up all the water used:

\[
\text{Total water used} = 120 + 60 + 7 + 3 = 190 \text{ ounces}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water Leon had:

\[
\text{Water left} = 312 - 190 = 122 \text{ ounces}
\]

Thus, the amount of water Leon has left is \(\boxed{122}\) ounces.",122.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Leon starts with 312 ounces of water.
2. He makes 10 giant cubes, and each giant cube uses 12 ounces of water.
   - Total water used for giant cubes = 10 * 12 = 120 ounces.
3. He makes 12 medium cubes, and each medium cube uses 5 ounces of water.
   - Total water used for medium cubes = 12 * 5 = 60 ounces.
4. He makes 14 small cubes, and each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water.
   - Total water used for small cubes = 14 * 0.5 = 7 ounces.
5. Now, let's calculate the total water used for all the cubes:
   - Total water used = water used for giant cubes + water used for medium cubes + water used for small cubes
   - Total water used = 120 + 60 + 7 = 187 ounces.
6. To find out how much water Leon has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water:
   - Water left = 312 - 187 = 125 ounces.

The answer is 125 ounces.",125.0,0,1,1,122.0,"--- Beginning of the template ---

What percentage of the students like to play video games if the number of the students that like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football?",5.0,"To find the percentage of students who like to play video games, we first need to determine how many students like to bake and how many like to play video games.

1. **Identify the number of students with specific hobbies:**
   - Students who like to hike: 69
   - Students who like to play chess: 8
   - Students who like to swim: 13
   - Students who like to play football: 13

2. **Calculate the total number of students with known hobbies:**
   \[
   \text{Total with known hobbies} = 69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103
   \]

3. **Determine the number of students who like to bake:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of students who like to play football. According to the problem, the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number of students who like to play football:
   \[
   \text{Number who like to bake} = 4x - 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 13 \) (the number of students who like to play football):
   \[
   \text{Number who like to bake} = 4(13) - 3 = 52 - 3 = 49
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of students who like to play video games:**
   The total number of students in the class is 160. Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number who like to play video games} = \text{Total students} - \text{Total with known hobbies} - \text{Number who like to bake}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number who like to play video games} = 160 - 103 - 49 = 8

5. **Calculate the percentage of students who like to play video games:**
   To find the percentage, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number who like to play video games}}{\text{Total students}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{8}{160} \right) \times 100 = 5\%

   - 13 like to swim
   - 13 like to play football

3. First, we calculate the total number of students who like the hobbies mentioned:
   \[
   69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103
   \]

4. Now, we find out how many students are left who either like to play video games or bake:
   \[
   160 - 103 = 57

Jamal starts with $80 and wants 10 gallons of paint, each priced at $7.0, and 3 carpenter pencils, each costing $2. The store offers a 10% discount on paint for members. How much more money does Elena have left than Jamal after they leave the store?",8.0,"To find out how much more money Elena has left than Jamal after they leave the store, we need to calculate the total expenses for both Elena and Jamal and then determine their remaining balances.

### Step 1: Calculate Elena's total expenses

1. **Cost of anchors**:
   - Each anchor costs $0.26.
   - For 15 anchors: 
     \[
     15 \times 0.26 = 3.90
     \]

2. **Cost of nails**:
   - Each nail costs $0.61.
   - For 9 nails:
     \[
     9 \times 0.61 = 5.49
     \]

3. **Cost of paint**:
   - Each gallon of paint costs $7.00.
   - For 10 gallons:
     \[
     10 \times 7.00 = 70.00
     \]

4. **Total cost for Elena**:
   \[
   \text{Total} = \text{Cost of anchors} + \text{Cost of nails} + \text{Cost of paint}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total} = 3.90 + 5.49 + 70.00 = 79.39

5. **Remaining balance for Elena**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 98.39 - 79.39 = 19.00
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Jamal's total expenses

1. **Cost of paint** (with discount):
   - Each gallon of paint costs $7.00, but Jamal gets a 10% discount.
   - Discount on each gallon:
     \[

     \]
   - Discounted price per gallon:
     \[
     7.00 - 0.70 = 6.30
     \]
   - For 10 gallons:
     \[
     10 \times 6.30 = 63.00
     \]

2. **Cost of carpenter pencils**:
   - Each pencil costs $2.00.
   - For 3 pencils:
     \[
     3 \times 2.00 = 6.00
     \]

3. **Total cost for Jamal**:
   \[
   \text{Total} = \text{Cost of paint} + \text{Cost of pencils}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total} = 63.00 + 6.00 = 69.00

4. **Remaining balance for Jamal**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 80.00 - 69.00 = 11.00

   \[
   \text{Difference} = 19.00 - 11.00 = 8.00
   \]

### Conclusion

Elena has **$8.00** more than Jamal after they leave the store.",8.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate Elena's total expenses.**

- **Cost of anchors:**
  Each anchor costs $0.26, and Elena wants to buy 15 anchors.
  \[
  \text{Total cost of anchors} = 15 \times 0.26 = 3.90
  \]

- **Cost of nails:**
  Each nail costs $0.61, and Elena needs 9 nails.
  \[
  \text{Total cost of nails} = 9 \times 0.61 = 5.49
  \]

- **Cost of paint:**
  Each gallon of paint costs $7.00, and Elena wants to buy 10 gallons.
  \[
  \text{Total cost of paint} = 10 \times 7.00 = 70.00
  \]

- **Total expenses for Elena:**
  \[
  \text{Total expenses} = \text{Cost of anchors} + \text{Cost of nails} + \text{Cost of paint}
  \]
  \[
  = 3.90 + 5.49 + 70.00 = 79.39
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate how much money Elena has left.**
Elena starts with $98.39.
\[
\text{Money left for Elena} = 98.39 - 79.39 = 19.00
\]

**Step 3: Calculate Jamal's total expenses.**

- **Cost of paint for Jamal:**
  Jamal also wants 10 gallons of paint, but he gets a 10% discount.
  \[
  \text{Total cost of paint before discount} = 10 \times 7.00 = 70.00
  \]
  \[
  \text{Discount} = 10\% \text{ of } 70.00 = 0.10 \times 70.00 = 7.00
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total cost of paint after discount} = 70.00 - 7.00 = 63.00
  \]

- **Cost of carpenter pencils:**
  Each pencil costs $2, and Jamal wants 3 pencils.
  \[
  \text{Total cost of pencils} = 3 \times 2 = 6.00
  \]

- **Total expenses for Jamal:**
  \[
  \text{Total expenses} = \text{Cost of paint} + \text{Cost of pencils}
  \]
  \[
  = 63.00 + 6.00 = 69.00
  \]

**Step 4: Calculate how much money Jamal has left.**
Jamal starts with $80.
\[
\text{Money left for Jamal} = 80 - 69.00 = 11.00
\]

**Step 5: Calculate how much more money Elena has left than Jamal.**
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Money left for Elena} - \text{Money left for Jamal}
\]
\[
= 19.00 - 11.00 = 8.00
\]

The answer is 8.00.",8.0,1,0,1,8.0,,,

After 2 days, DeShawn decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half. How many days will it take for the cake to be fully eaten?",4.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the daily consumption of each person:**
   - Arash eats 5 pieces a day.
   - Ava eats twice as much as Arash: 
     \[
     \text{Ava's consumption} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pieces per day}
     \]
   - DeShawn eats twice as much as Ava:
     \[
     \text{DeShawn's consumption} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ pieces per day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total consumption for the first 2 days:**
   - In one day, the total consumption of all three is:
     \[
     \text{Total daily consumption} = 5 + 10 + 20 = 35 \text{ pieces}
     \]
   - In 2 days, the total consumption is:
     \[
     \text{Total consumption in 2 days} = 2 \times 35 = 70 \text{ pieces}
     \]

3. **Calculate the remaining pieces of cake after 2 days:**
   - Initially, there are 120 pieces of cake. After 2 days, the remaining pieces are:
     \[
     \text{Remaining pieces} = 120 - 70 = 50 \text{ pieces}
     \]

4. **Determine DeShawn's new consumption rate after going on a diet:**
   - After 2 days, DeShawn cuts his consumption in half:
     \[
     \text{DeShawn's new consumption} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ pieces per day}
     \]

5. **Calculate the new total daily consumption after DeShawn's diet:**
   - Now, the total daily consumption becomes:
     \[
     \text{New total daily consumption} = 5 + 10 + 10 = 25 \text{ pieces}
     \]

6. **Calculate how many days it will take to finish the remaining cake:**
   - With 50 pieces remaining and a daily consumption of 25 pieces, the number of days required to finish the cake is:
     \[
     \text{Days to finish remaining cake} = \frac{50}{25} = 2 \text{ days}
     \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken to eat the entire cake:**
   - The total time taken is the initial 2 days plus the additional 2 days:
     \[
     \text{Total days} = 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ days}
     \]

Thus, it will take a total of **4 days** for the cake to be fully eaten.",4.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine how much each person eats per day:**
   - Arash eats 5 pieces a day.
   - Ava eats twice as much as Arash, so she eats 5 * 2 = 10 pieces a day.
   - DeShawn eats two times as much as Ava, so he eats 10 * 2 = 20 pieces a day.

2. **Calculate the total pieces eaten by all three in the first 2 days:**
   - In one day, the total pieces eaten by Arash, Ava, and DeShawn is:
     - Arash: 5 pieces
     - Ava: 10 pieces
     - DeShawn: 20 pieces
     - Total per day = 5 + 10 + 20 = 35 pieces.
   - In 2 days, they will eat:
     - Total in 2 days = 35 * 2 = 70 pieces.

3. **Calculate the remaining pieces of cake after 2 days:**
   - Initially, there are 120 pieces.
   - After 2 days, the remaining pieces are:
     - Remaining = 120 - 70 = 50 pieces.

4. **Determine DeShawn's new eating rate after going on a diet:**
   - After 2 days, DeShawn decides to cut his consumption by half, so he now eats:
     - New DeShawn's rate = 20 / 2 = 10 pieces a day.

5. **Calculate the total pieces eaten by all three after DeShawn's diet:**
   - Now, Arash eats 5 pieces, Ava eats 10 pieces, and DeShawn eats 10 pieces.
   - Total pieces eaten per day after the diet:
     - Total = 5 + 10 + 10 = 25 pieces.

6. **Calculate how many more days it will take to finish the remaining cake:**
   - There are 50 pieces left.
   - To find out how many days it will take to eat the remaining pieces:
     - Days needed = Remaining pieces / Total pieces eaten per day = 50 / 25 = 2 days.

7. **Calculate the total number of days to finish the cake:**
   - Total days = 2 days (initial) + 2 days (after diet) = 4 days.

The crayon box has 12 different colors of crayon, and the sticker book has 6 pages, each with 12 stickers. The tower of stacking rings has 29 multicolored rings on it. Gabrielle recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of items for her nephew up to 320. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?",63.0,"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we first need to calculate the total number of items Gabrielle already has before adding the bouncy balls.

1. **Building Blocks**: 43 blocks
2. **Stuffed Animals**: 5 stuffed animals
3. **Action Figures**: The number of action figures is twice the number of blocks and stuffed animals combined. 
   - First, we calculate the total number of blocks and stuffed animals:
     \[
     43 + 5 = 48
     \]
   - Now, we find the number of action figures:
     \[
     2 \times 48 = 96 \text{ action figures}
     \]
4. **Crayons**: 12 different colors of crayon
5. **Stickers**: The sticker book has 6 pages, each with 12 stickers. So, the total number of stickers is:
   \[
   6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ stickers}
   \]
6. **Stacking Rings**: 29 multicolored rings

Now, we can sum all these items to find the total number of items Gabrielle has before adding the bouncy balls:

\[
\text{Total items} = \text{Building Blocks} + \text{Stuffed Animals} + \text{Action Figures} + \text{Crayons} + \text{Stickers} + \text{Stacking Rings}
\]
\[
\text{Total items} = 43 + 5 + 96 + 12 + 72 + 29

Calculating this step by step:

- \(43 + 5 = 48\)
- \(48 + 96 = 144\)
- \(144 + 12 = 156\)
- \(156 + 72 = 228\)
- \(228 + 29 = 257\)

So, Gabrielle has a total of 257 items before adding the bouncy balls.

Now, we know that the total number of items after adding the bouncy balls is 320. Let \(x\) be the number of bouncy balls. We can set up the equation:

\[
257 + x = 320
\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 257 from both sides:

\[
x = 320 - 257

Due to the pandemic, 20 patients are admitted into the care facility each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks.",530.0,"To find the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rooms that are out of service:**
   The total capacity of the care facility is 1900 rooms. One-fourth of these rooms are out of service.
   \[
   \text{Rooms out of service} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475 \text{ rooms}

3. **Calculate the total number of rooms that are either occupied or out of service:**
   \[
   \text{Total occupied and out of service} = \text{Occupied rooms} + \text{Rooms out of service} = 475 + 475 = 950 \text{ rooms}

5. **Calculate the number of patients admitted over 3 weeks:**
   There are 20 patients admitted each day. The number of days in 3 weeks is:
   \[
   \text{Days in 3 weeks} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days}

On Wednesday, he sold 27 boxes of muffin and 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie, than on Thursday. On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday and 21 boxes of apricot pie. On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?",796.0,"To find Faisal's average daily earning, we first need to determine how many boxes of muffins and apricot pies he sold on each day (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday).

### Step 1: Determine Sales on Wednesday
Let:
- \( m_W \) = number of muffin boxes sold on Wednesday
- \( a_W \) = number of apricot pie boxes sold on Wednesday

From the problem, we know:
- \( m_W = 27 \)
- \( a_W = m_W - 13 = 27 - 13 = 14 \)

### Step 2: Determine Sales on Thursday
Let:
- \( m_T \) = number of muffin boxes sold on Thursday
- \( a_T \) = number of apricot pie boxes sold on Thursday

From the problem, we know:
- \( m_T = m_W + 11 = 27 + 11 = 38 \)
- \( a_T = 21 \)

### Step 3: Determine Sales on Friday
On Friday, Faisal sold as much as he did on Wednesday and Thursday combined. 

Total sales from Wednesday:
- Muffins: \( m_W = 27 \)
- Apricot pies: \( a_W = 14 \)

Total sales from Thursday:
- Muffins: \( m_T = 38 \)
- Apricot pies: \( a_T = 21 \)

Calculating total sales for Wednesday:
\[
\text{Total Wednesday} = m_W + a_W = 27 + 14 = 41
\]

Calculating total sales for Thursday:
\[
\text{Total Thursday} = m_T + a_T = 38 + 21 = 59
\]

Now, combine the totals from both days:
\[
\text{Total for Wednesday and Thursday} = 41 + 59 = 100
\]

Thus, on Friday, Faisal sold:
- \( m_F + a_F = 100 \)

### Step 4: Calculate Earnings
Now we calculate the earnings for each day.

**Earnings on Wednesday:**
\[
\text{Earnings}_W = (m_W \times 9) + (a_W \times 21) = (27 \times 9) + (14 \times 21)
\]
Calculating:
\[
27 \times 9 = 243
\]
\[
14 \times 21 = 294
\]
\[
\text{Earnings}_W = 243 + 294 = 537
\]

**Earnings on Thursday:**
\[
\text{Earnings}_T = (m_T \times 9) + (a_T \times 21) = (38 \times 9) + (21 \times 21)
\]
Calculating:
\[
38 \times 9 = 342
\]
\[
21 \times 21 = 441
\]
\[
\text{Earnings}_T = 342 + 441 = 783
\]

**Earnings on Friday:**
Since he sold 100 boxes on Friday, we need to determine how many of each type he sold. However, we can calculate the total earnings directly since we know the total sales:
Let \( x \) be the number of muffin boxes sold on Friday and \( y \) be the number of apricot pies sold on Friday. We know:
\[
x + y = 100
\]
The earnings for Friday can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Earnings}_F = (x \times 9) + (y \times 21)
\]
We can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
y = 100 - x
\]
Thus,
\[
\text{Earnings}_F = (x \times 9) + ((100 - x) \times 21)
\]
Expanding this:
\[
\text{Earnings}_F = 9x + 2100 - 21x = 2100 - 12x
\]
To find the exact earnings, we can assume Faisal sold a mix of muffins and apricot pies. However, we can also calculate the total earnings based on the total sales:
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Earnings}_W + \text{Earnings}_T + \text{Earnings}_F
\]
Calculating \( \text{Earnings}_F \) based on the total sales:
\[
\text{Earnings}_F = 100 \times \text{average price}
\]
Average price per box:
\[
\text{Average price} = \frac{(9 + 21)}{2} = 15
\]
Thus,
\[
\text{Earnings}_F = 100 \times 15 = 1500
\]

### Step 5: Total Earnings and Average Daily Earnings
Now we can calculate the total earnings:
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = 537 + 783 + 1500 = 2820
\]

Now, we find the average daily earnings over 3 days:
\[
\text{Average Daily Earnings} = \frac{\text{Total Earnings}}{3} = \frac{2820}{3} = 940
\]

### Final Answer
Faisal's average daily earning is **₺940**.",940.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the number of boxes sold on Wednesday:**
   - Faisal sold 27 boxes of muffins on Wednesday.
   - He sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pies than on Thursday. 

2. **Determine the number of boxes sold on Thursday:**
   - On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday.
   - So, the number of muffins sold on Thursday is:
     \[
     27 + 11 = 38 \text{ boxes}
     \]
   - He sold 21 boxes of apricot pies on Thursday.

3. **Calculate the total boxes sold on Wednesday:**
   - The number of apricot pies sold on Wednesday is:
     \[
     21 - 13 = 8 \text{ boxes}
     \]
   - Therefore, on Wednesday, he sold:
     \[
     27 \text{ (muffins)} + 8 \text{ (apricot pies)} = 35 \text{ boxes}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total boxes sold on Thursday:**
   - On Thursday, he sold:
     \[
     38 \text{ (muffins)} + 21 \text{ (apricot pies)} = 59 \text{ boxes}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total boxes sold on Friday:**
   - On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined:
     \[
     35 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 59 \text{ (Thursday)} = 94 \text{ boxes}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total earnings for each day:**
   - **Earnings on Wednesday:**
     - Muffins: \(27 \times 9 = ₺243\)
     - Apricot pies: \(8 \times 21 = ₺168\)
     - Total earnings on Wednesday:
     \[
     ₺243 + ₺168 = ₺411
     \]

   - **Earnings on Thursday:**
     - Muffins: \(38 \times 9 = ₺342\)
     - Apricot pies: \(21 \times 21 = ₺441\)
     - Total earnings on Thursday:
     \[
     ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783
     \]

   - **Earnings on Friday:**
     - Total boxes sold on Friday: 94
     - To find the number of muffins and apricot pies sold, we need to assume a ratio based on previous sales. However, since we need total earnings, we can calculate it based on the average price of the items sold.
     - Average price per box:
     \[
     \text{Average price} = \frac{(9 + 21)}{2} = ₺15
     \]
     - Total earnings on Friday:
     \[
     94 \times 15 = ₺1410
     \]

7. **Calculate total earnings over the three days:**
   \[
   ₺411 + ₺783 + ₺1410 = ₺2604
   \]

8. **Calculate the average daily earning:**
   - There are 3 days:
   \[
   \text{Average daily earning} = \frac{₺2604}{3} = ₺868
   \]

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of apricot pies sold on Thursday and did not correctly account for the total sales when calculating the average earnings. I also made errors in adding the total earnings for each day.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect addition
- Misinterpretation of problem

### Solution:
1. **Identify the quantities sold:**
   - On Wednesday, Faisal sold 27 boxes of muffins and 13 fewer boxes of apricot pies than on Thursday.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apricot pies sold on Thursday. Then, on Wednesday, he sold \( x - 13 \) apricot pies.

2. **Set up equations based on the problem:**
   - On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday:
     \[
     \text{Muffins on Thursday} = 27 + 11 = 38
     \]
   - On Thursday, he sold 21 boxes of apricot pies:
     \[
     x = 21 \quad \text{(apricot pies on Thursday)}
     \]
   - Therefore, on Wednesday, he sold:
     \[
     \text{Apricot pies on Wednesday} = 21 - 13 = 8
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of items sold for each day:**
   - **Wednesday:**
     - Muffins: 27
     - Apricot pies: 8
   - **Thursday:**
     - Muffins: 38
     - Apricot pies: 21
   - **Friday:**
     - Total sold on Wednesday: \( 27 + 8 = 35 \)
     - Total sold on Thursday: \( 38 + 21 = 59 \)
     - Total sold on Friday: \( 35 + 59 = 94 \)

4. **Determine the total earnings for each day:**
   - **Wednesday:**
     \[
     \text{Earnings} = (27 \times 9) + (8 \times 21) = 243 + 168 = 411
     \]
   - **Thursday:**
     \[
     \text{Earnings} = (38 \times 9) + (21 \times 21) = 342 + 441 = 783
     \]
   - **Friday:**
     - Muffins sold: \( 94 - 21 = 73 \) (since he sold 21 apricot pies)
     - Apricot pies sold: 21
     \[
     \text{Earnings} = (73 \times 9) + (21 \times 21) = 657 + 441 = 1098
     \]

5. **Calculate the total earnings and average daily earning:**
   - Total earnings:
     \[
     411 + 783 + 1098 = 2292
     \]
   - Average daily earning:
     \[
     \text{Average} = \frac{2292}{3} = 764
     \]

### Final Answer:
Faisal's average daily earning is **₺764**.

On Tuesday, she sold 10 more cookies than on Monday and 25 brownies. On Wednesday, she sold as much as she did on the previous two days combined. If the cookies cost $2 each and the brownies cost $3 each, what was Sarah's average daily earning?

Wrong answer: I calculated the total sales incorrectly by not adding the correct number of cookies and brownies sold on each day. I thought she sold 50 cookies on Tuesday instead of 50 cookies and 25 brownies, leading to a wrong total.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total number of cookies and brownies sold on each day by not properly tracking the relationships between the quantities sold. I also failed to correctly calculate the total earnings based on the prices of the items.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect addition
- Misunderstanding relationships

Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify the relationships between the quantities sold on different days.
2. Set up equations based on the information given for each day.
3. Calculate the total number of items sold for each day.
4. Multiply the quantities sold by their respective prices to find the total earnings for each day.
5. Add the total earnings from all days and divide by the number of days to find the average daily earning.

Advice:
- Always double-check the relationships between quantities in word problems.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each part step-by-step.
- Keep track of your calculations to avoid miscalculations.
- Practice similar problems to become familiar with the structure and common pitfalls.

Solution:
On Monday, Sarah sold 40 cookies and 25 brownies (40 - 15). On Tuesday, she sold 50 cookies (40 + 10) and 25 brownies. On Wednesday, she sold a total of 115 items (40 + 25 + 50 + 25). The total earnings are calculated as follows: 
- Monday: (40 * $2) + (25 * $3) = $80 + $75 = $155
- Tuesday: (50 * $2) + (25 * $3) = $100 + $75 = $175
- Wednesday: (115 * $2) + (75 * $3) = $230 + $225 = $455
Total earnings = $155 + $175 + $455 = $785
Average daily earning = $785 / 3 = $261.67

Out of the remaining class, 45% of the students are choir members or part of dancers. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away tournament. Half of the swimmers are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the tournament?",66.0,"To find out how many students are leaving early to the tournament, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of swimmers:**
   - Total students in the class = 120
   - Percentage of swimmers = 50%
   - Number of swimmers = 50% of 120 = 0.50 * 120 = 60 swimmers

2. **Calculate the number of non-swimmers:**
   - Number of non-swimmers = Total students - Number of swimmers
   - Number of non-swimmers = 120 - 60 = 60 non-swimmers

3. **Calculate the number of choir members or dancers:**
   - Percentage of non-swimmers who are choir members or dancers = 45%
   - Number of choir members or dancers = 45% of 60 = 0.45 * 60 = 27 students

4. **Calculate the number of swimmers who are leaving:**
   - Half of the swimmers are absent due to being sick.
   - Number of swimmers leaving = 60 swimmers * 0.5 = 30 swimmers

5. **Calculate the total number of students leaving:**
   - Total students leaving = Number of swimmers leaving + Number of choir members or dancers
   - Total students leaving = 30 swimmers + 27 choir members/dancers = 57 students

6. **Calculate the number of cheerleaders accompanying the groups:**
   - There are 3 cheerleaders for each of the 3 groups (swimmers, choir members, dancers).
   - Total cheerleaders = 3 cheerleaders * 3 groups = 9 cheerleaders

7. **Calculate the final total of students leaving early:**
   - Total students leaving early = Total students leaving + Total cheerleaders
   - Total students leaving early = 57 + 9 = 66 students

Thus, the total number of students leaving early to the tournament is **66 students**.",66.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Total number of students in Mrs. Garcia's class**: 120 students.

2. **Percentage of students who are swimmers**: 50% of the class.
   - Number of swimmers = 50% of 120 = 0.5 * 120 = 60 swimmers.

3. **Remaining students after accounting for swimmers**:
   - Remaining students = Total students - Swimmers = 120 - 60 = 60 students.

4. **Percentage of remaining students who are choir members or dancers**: 45%.
   - Number of choir members or dancers = 45% of 60 = 0.45 * 60 = 27 students.

5. **Total students leaving early**:
   - Students leaving = Swimmers + Choir members or dancers = 60 + 27 = 87 students.

6. **Half of the swimmers are absent due to being sick**:
   - Absent swimmers = 50% of 60 = 0.5 * 60 = 30 swimmers.
   - Present swimmers = 60 - 30 = 30 swimmers.

7. **Total students leaving early now**:
   - Students leaving = Present swimmers + Choir members or dancers = 30 + 27 = 57 students.

8. **Adding cheerleaders**: 3 cheerleaders accompany each group (swimmers, choir members, dancers).
   - Total cheerleaders = 3 (for swimmers) + 3 (for choir members or dancers) = 6 cheerleaders.

9. **Final total of students leaving early**:
   - Total leaving = Students leaving + Cheerleaders = 57 + 6 = 63 students.

4. **Calculate the number of swimmers who are absent:**
   - Half of the swimmers are absent = 0.50 × 60 = 30 swimmers are absent.
   - Therefore, the number of swimmers leaving = 60 - 30 = 30 swimmers.

5. **Calculate the total number of students leaving:**
   - Total leaving = Swimmers leaving + Choir members/dancers + Cheerleaders.
   - Cheerleaders: 3 cheerleaders for each group (swimmers, choir members/dancers).
   - Total cheerleaders = 3 (swimmers) + 3 (choir/dancers) = 6 cheerleaders.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I miscalculated the number of students in each group and failed to account for the cheerleaders correctly. I also did not properly consider the number of students who were absent from the swimmer group.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Group counting
- Percentage application
- Omission of additional members
- Absentee consideration

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the number of swimmers:**
   - 50% of 120 students = 0.50 * 120 = 60 swimmers.

2. **Calculate the remaining students:**
   - Remaining students = Total students - Swimmers = 120 - 60 = 60 students.

3. **Calculate the number of choir members or dancers:**
   - 45% of the remaining 60 students = 0.45 * 60 = 27 students.

4. **Calculate the number of swimmers who are present:**
   - Half of the swimmers are absent, so present swimmers = 60 / 2 = 30 swimmers.

5. **Total students leaving early:**
   - Total leaving early = Present swimmers + Choir members/dancers = 30 + 27 = 57 students.

6. **Calculate the number of cheerleaders:**
   - There are 3 cheerleaders accompanying each group (swimmers, choir members/dancers).
   - Total cheerleaders = 3 (for swimmers) + 3 (for choir/dancers) = 6 cheerleaders.

7. **Final total of students leaving early:**
   - Total leaving early = Students leaving + Cheerleaders = 57 + 6 = 63 students.

### New Answer:
63 students are leaving early to the tournament.

### Instructions:
1. Identify the total number of students in the class.
2. Calculate the number of students in each specified group using the given percentages.
3. Determine how many students are absent from each group.
4. Add the number of present students from each group.
5. Include any additional members (like cheerleaders) accompanying the groups.

Question: In a school of 200 students, 60% are enrolled in sports. Out of the remaining students, 30% are involved in music or drama. If 20% of the sports students are absent, and 2 mentors accompany each group, how many students are participating in the event?
Wrong answer: I calculated that 60% of 200 is 120, then I found that 30% of the remaining 80 students is 24. I added these together and got 144, then I mistakenly thought that 20% of 120 is 24, so I subtracted that from 144 and got 120. I miscounted the mentors and didn't include them in my final answer.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Olga has a flower bed that is 132 meters long. Olga wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Olga's flowers grow 3meters wide so she needs to leave 12 meters between every plant (including the plants width). Olga already owns 7 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ₣9 at the store. However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",31.0,"To determine how much money Olga will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total width occupied by each flower**: 
   Each flower is 3 meters wide, and there is a 12-meter gap between each flower. Therefore, the total width occupied by each flower (including the gap) is:
   \[
   \text{Total width per flower} = 3 \text{ meters} + 12 \text{ meters} = 15 \text{ meters}
   \]

2. **Determine how many flowers can fit in the flower bed**:
   The flower bed is 132 meters long. To find out how many flowers can fit, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the total width occupied by each flower:
   \[
   \text{Number of flowers that can fit} = \frac{132 \text{ meters}}{15 \text{ meters}} \approx 8.8
   \]
   Since Olga cannot plant a fraction of a flower, we round down to the nearest whole number:
   \[
   \text{Number of flowers that can fit} = 8
   \]

3. **Calculate how many more flowers Olga needs**:
   Olga already owns 7 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs is:
   \[
   \text{Additional flowers needed} = 8 - 7 = 1
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the additional flowers**:
   Each flowering plant costs ₣9. Therefore, the cost for 1 additional flower is:
   \[
   \text{Cost for 1 flower} = 1 \times 9 = ₣9
   \]

5. **Determine if the discount applies**:
   Since Olga is only buying 1 additional flower, she does not qualify for the discount (which applies only if she buys more than 2 plants).

6. **Calculate the total cost**:
   Since she is only buying 1 flower, the total cost remains:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = ₣9
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money Olga will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is **₣9**.",9.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the total width occupied by each plant**: Each flower grows 3 meters wide, and Olga needs to leave 12 meters between every plant. Therefore, the total space occupied by each plant (including the space between them) is:
   \[
   3 \text{ meters (width of the plant)} + 12 \text{ meters (space)} = 15 \text{ meters}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many plants can fit in the flower bed**: The flower bed is 132 meters long. To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space occupied by each plant:
   \[
   \frac{132 \text{ meters}}{15 \text{ meters per plant}} = 8.8
   \]
   Since Olga cannot plant a fraction of a plant, she can fit 8 plants in the flower bed.

3. **Determine how many more plants Olga needs to buy**: Olga already owns 7 flowers. Therefore, the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:
   \[
   8 \text{ (total plants needed)} - 7 \text{ (plants she already has)} = 1 \text{ plant}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the additional plants**: Each flowering plant costs ₣9. Since she only needs to buy 1 plant, the total cost will be:
   \[
   1 \text{ plant} \times ₣9 = ₣9
   \]

5. **Check for discounts**: Olga is buying only 1 plant, which is not more than 2 plants. Therefore, she does not qualify for the ₣5 discount.

6. **Final cost**: Since there is no discount, the total amount Olga will spend at the store is:
   \[
   ₣9
   \]

The answer is ₣9.",9.0,0,1,0,9.0,"--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

[Example Input]
Question: Sarah has a garden that is 100 meters long. She wants to plant trees that are 2 meters wide and needs to leave 5 meters between each tree (including the width of the tree). Sarah already has 3 trees. Each tree costs ₣15, but if she buys more than 3 trees, she will receive a ₣10 discount on her total purchase. How much will Sarah spend to fill her garden with trees?

Wrong answer: I calculated that Sarah can fit 20 trees in her garden, so I multiplied 20 by ₣15, which gives ₣300. I forgot to account for the discount and the trees she already has.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of trees that could fit in the garden by not considering the space needed between them correctly. I also neglected to apply the discount for purchasing more than 3 trees.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Discount application
- Space allocation

Instructions:
1. Determine the total length available for planting by subtracting the space taken by existing trees.
2. Calculate the total width occupied by each tree and the space between them.
3. Divide the available length by the total width per tree (tree width + space) to find the maximum number of trees that can be planted.
4. Subtract the number of existing trees from the maximum number to find how many more trees need to be purchased.
5. Calculate the total cost based on the number of trees to be purchased and apply any applicable discounts.

Advice:
- Always double-check the calculations for space and dimensions.
- Be mindful of any discounts or special offers when calculating total costs.
- Break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps to avoid confusion.

Solution:
To solve the problem, first, calculate the total width occupied by each tree and the space between them: 2 meters (tree width) + 5 meters (space) = 7 meters per tree. Next, determine how many trees can fit in 100 meters: 100 meters / 7 meters per tree = approximately 14.29, so a maximum of 14 trees can be planted. Since Sarah already has 3 trees, she needs to buy 14 - 3 = 11 trees. The cost for 11 trees is 11 x ₣15 = ₣165. Since she is buying more than 3 trees, she gets a ₣10 discount, making her total cost ₣165 - ₣10 = ₣155. Thus, Sarah will spend ₣155 to fill her garden with trees.

I answered the question incorrectly because I miscalculated the number of plants that could fit in the flower bed. I did not properly account for the total space each plant occupies, including the space needed between them. Additionally, I failed to consider the number of existing plants Olga already owns, which affects how many more she needs to buy.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Space allocation
- Discount application

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the total width occupied by each plant and the space between them:**
   - Each plant is 3 meters wide, and the space between each plant is 12 meters.
   - Total space per plant = 3 meters (plant width) + 12 meters (space) = 15 meters.

2. **Determine how many plants can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 132 meters long.
   - Maximum number of plants = 132 meters / 15 meters per plant = 8.8.
   - Since we can only plant whole plants, the maximum number of plants that can fit is 8.

3. **Calculate how many more plants Olga needs to buy:**
   - Olga already owns 7 plants.
   - Additional plants needed = 8 (maximum) - 7 (owned) = 1 plant.

4. **Calculate the total cost for the additional plants:**
   - Cost of 1 plant = ₣9.
   - Total cost = 1 plant x ₣9 = ₣9.

5. **Check if the discount applies:**
   - Since Olga is buying only 1 additional plant, which is not more than 2, the discount does not apply.

6. **Final total cost:**
   - Total cost = ₣9 (no discount applied).

### Final Answer:
Olga will spend ₣9 to fill up her flower bed.

### Instructions for Future Problems:
1. Carefully read the problem to understand the dimensions and spacing requirements.
2. Calculate the total space each plant occupies, including the space needed between them.

I answered the question incorrectly because I did not properly calculate the number of plants that could fit in the flower bed. I failed to account for the total width of each plant plus the space needed between them. Additionally, I did not consider how many plants Olga already owns, which affected the total number she needed to buy.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Ignoring spacing
- Incorrect total plants calculation
- Discount application error

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the total width occupied by each plant and the space needed between them:**
   - Each plant is 3 meters wide, and the space between each plant is 12 meters.
   - Total width per plant including space = 3 meters (plant) + 12 meters (space) = 15 meters.

2. **Determine how many plants can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The total length of the flower bed is 132 meters.
   - Number of plants that can fit = Total length of flower bed / Total width per plant = 132 meters / 15 meters = 8.8.
   - Since we cannot have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 8 plants.

3. **Calculate how many more plants Olga needs to buy:**
   - Olga already owns 7 plants.
   - Additional plants needed = Total plants that can fit - Plants already owned = 8 - 7 = 1 plant.

4. **Calculate the total cost of the plants she needs to buy:**
   - Cost per plant = ₣9.
   - Total cost for 1 plant = 1 x ₣9 = ₣9.

5. **Check if the number of plants purchased qualifies for a discount:**
   - Since Olga is buying only 1 plant, she does not qualify for the ₣5 discount (the discount applies only if more than 2 plants are purchased).

6. **Final total cost:**
   - Since no discount applies, the total amount Olga will spend is ₣9.

### Final Answer:
Olga will spend ₣9 to fill up her flower bed.

### Instructions for Future Problems:
1. Carefully read the problem to identify all dimensions and spacing requirements.
2. Calculate the total width occupied by each item (plant, tree, etc.) including any required spacing.
3. Divide the total available length by the total width per item to determine how many can fit.
4. Subtract any items already owned from the total number that can fit to find out how many more need to be purchased.
5. Calculate the total cost based on the number of items needed and their individual price.
6. Check if the purchase qualifies for any discounts and apply them if applicable.
7. Review all calculations to ensure accuracy before finalizing the answer.

### General Advice for Similar Problems:
- Break down the problem into manageable parts to avoid confusion.
- Always double-check calculations, especially when dealing with dimensions and spacing.
- Keep track of any items already owned to avoid overestimating the number needed.
- Be mindful of discount thresholds and apply them correctly based on the number of items purchased.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Ignoring spacing
- Discount application error

Instructions:
1. Determine the total width occupied by each tree and the space needed between them.
2. Calculate how many trees can fit in the garden by dividing the total length of the garden by the total width of one tree plus the space.
3. Subtract the number of trees Sarah already has from the total number of trees that can fit to find out how many more she needs to buy.
4. Calculate the total cost of the trees she needs to buy.
5. Check if the number of trees purchased qualifies for a discount and apply it if applicable.

Advice:
- Always break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid missing details.
- Double-check calculations, especially when dealing with spacing and discounts.
- Write down all the steps clearly to ensure nothing is overlooked.

Solution:
To solve the problem, first, calculate the total width for each tree and the space: 2 meters (tree) + 5 meters (space) = 7 meters. The total length of the garden is 100 meters, so 100 / 7 = approximately 14.29, meaning Sarah can fit 14 trees. Since she already has 3, she needs to buy 14 - 3 = 11 trees. The cost for 11 trees is 11 x ₣15 = ₣165. Since she is buying more than 3 trees, she qualifies for a ₣10 discount, making her total ₣165 - ₣10 = ₣155. Thus, Sarah will spend ₣155 to fill her garden with trees.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of trees that could fit in the garden because I did not consider the width of the trees and the spacing required between them.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Ignoring spacing
- Incorrect total count

Instructions:
1. Determine the total length available for planting by subtracting the width of the existing trees from the total length of the garden.
2. Calculate the total space each tree occupies (tree width + space between trees).
3. Divide the available length by the total space each tree occupies to find the maximum number of trees that can be planted.
4. Subtract the number of existing trees from the maximum number to find how many more trees need to be purchased.
5. Calculate the total cost based on the number of trees to be purchased and apply any discounts if applicable.

Advice:
- Always account for both the width of the items being placed and the required spacing when calculating how many can fit in a given area.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid missing important details.
- Double-check calculations to ensure all factors are considered.

Solution:
To solve the problem, I first determine the total space each tree occupies: 2 meters (tree width) + 5 meters (space) = 7 meters. The available length for planting is 100 meters - (4 trees * 2 meters) = 92 meters. I can fit 92 meters / 7 meters per tree = 13 trees (rounded down). Since Sarah already has 4 trees, she needs to buy 13 - 4 = 9 trees. The cost for 9 trees is 9 * ₣10 = ₣90. Since she is buying more than 2 trees, she gets a ₣5 discount, making the total cost ₣90 - ₣5 = ₣85.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not properly calculate the total space each plant occupies, including the required spacing between them. I also failed to account for the number of existing plants when determining how many more plants needed to be purchased.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Ignoring spacing
- Incorrect total count
- Failure to account for existing items

### Solution:
1. **Determine the total space each plant occupies**: 
   - Each plant is 3 meters wide, and there is a 12-meter gap between each plant. Therefore, the total space each plant occupies is:
     \[
     3 \text{ meters (plant width)} + 12 \text{ meters (space)} = 15 \text{ meters}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total length available for planting**:
   - Olga has a flower bed that is 132 meters long. First, we need to account for the 7 existing plants:
     \[
     \text{Space occupied by existing plants} = 7 \text{ plants} \times 3 \text{ meters/plant} = 21 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - The available length for planting new plants is:
     \[
     132 \text{ meters} - 21 \text{ meters} = 111 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Calculate how many additional plants can fit**:
   - To find out how many additional plants can fit in the available length, we divide the available length by the total space each plant occupies:
     \[
     \text{Number of additional plants} = \frac{111 \text{ meters}}{15 \text{ meters/plant}} \approx 7.4
     \]
   - Since we can only have whole plants, we round down to 7 additional plants.

4. **Calculate the total number of plants**:
   - The total number of plants Olga will have after purchasing is:
     \[
     7 \text{ existing plants} + 7 \text{ additional plants} = 14 \text{ plants}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost**:
   - The cost for 14 plants at ₣9 each is:
     \[
     14 \text{ plants} \times ₣9/\text{plant} = ₣126
     \]
   - Since Olga is buying more than 2 plants, she receives a ₣5 discount:
     \[
     \text{Total cost after discount} = ₣126 - ₣5 = ₣121
     \]

### Final Answer:
Olga will spend **₣121** at the store to fill up her flower bed.

### Instructions for Future Problems:
1. Carefully read the problem to identify all dimensions and requirements.
2. Calculate the total space each item occupies, including any necessary spacing.
3. Determine the total length available for new items by subtracting the space occupied by existing items.
4. Divide the available length by the total space each item occupies to find how many can fit.
5. Add the number of existing items to the number of new items to find the total.
6. Calculate the total cost based on the number of items and apply any discounts if applicable.

### General Advice for Similar Problems:
- Always account for both the size of the items and the required spacing when determining how many can fit in a given area.
- Break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps to avoid missing important details.
- Double-check calculations to ensure all factors are considered, especially when dealing with discounts or existing items.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,Olga can peel 6 clams a minute and saute 30 clams in 19 minutes. How many minutes will it take her to peel and saute 150 clams if it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam before peeling it? Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.,163.0,"To determine how long it will take Olga to peel and sauté 150 clams, we need to break down the tasks into their respective times and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the time to wash the clams
Olga needs to wash each clam before peeling it, and it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam. 

For 150 clams:
\[
\text{Time to wash} = 150 \text{ clams} \times 12 \text{ seconds/clam} = 1800 \text{ seconds}
\]

Convert seconds to minutes:
\[
1800 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time to peel the clams
Olga can peel 6 clams per minute. 

For 150 clams:
\[
\text{Time to peel} = \frac{150 \text{ clams}}{6 \text{ clams/minute}} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the break time
After peeling, Olga takes a 13-minute break.

### Step 4: Calculate the time to sauté the clams
Olga can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes. 

To find out how long it takes to sauté 150 clams, we first determine how many batches of 30 clams are in 150 clams:
\[
\text{Number of batches} = \frac{150 \text{ clams}}{30 \text{ clams/batch}} = 5 \text{ batches}
\]

Now, calculate the total time to sauté 150 clams:
\[
\text{Time to sauté} = 5 \text{ batches} \times 19 \text{ minutes/batch} = 95 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 5: Total time calculation
Now, we sum all the times:
- Time to wash: 30 minutes
- Time to peel: 25 minutes
- Break time: 13 minutes
- Time to sauté: 95 minutes

Total time:
\[
\text{Total time} = 30 + 25 + 13 + 95 = 163 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it will take Olga a total of **163 minutes** to wash, peel, take a break, and sauté 150 clams.",150.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the time to wash 150 clams:**
   - It takes 12 seconds to wash each clam.
   - For 150 clams, the total washing time is:
     \[
     150 \text{ clams} \times 12 \text{ seconds/clam} = 1800 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Convert seconds to minutes:
     \[
     1800 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time to peel 150 clams:**
   - Olga can peel 6 clams a minute.
   - The time to peel 150 clams is:
     \[
     150 \text{ clams} \div 6 \text{ clams/minute} = 25 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Add the washing and peeling time:**
   - Total time for washing and peeling:
     \[
     30 \text{ minutes (washing)} + 25 \text{ minutes (peeling)} = 55 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Add the break time after peeling:**
   - After peeling, Olga takes a 13-minute break.
   - Total time now is:
     \[
     55 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 68 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Calculate the time to sauté 150 clams:**
   - It takes 19 minutes to sauté 30 clams.
   - To find the time to sauté 150 clams, first determine how many batches of 30 clams are in 150 clams:
     \[
     150 \text{ clams} \div 30 \text{ clams/batch} = 5 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - The total time to sauté 150 clams is:
     \[
     5 \text{ batches} \times 19 \text{ minutes/batch} = 95 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Add the sautéing time to the total time:**
   - Total time for washing, peeling, break, and sautéing:
     \[
     68 \text{ minutes} + 95 \text{ minutes} = 163 \text{ minutes}

He is going to sell each box for $8. How much is Andre going to make?",408.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Pineapples picked on each day:**
   - Saturday: 177 pineapples
   - Sunday: 183 pineapples
   - Monday: Double the amount picked on Saturday:
     \[
     \text{Monday's pineapples} = 2 \times 177 = 354 \text{ pineapples}
     \]

2. **Total pineapples picked from Saturday to Monday:**
   \[
   \text{Total for Saturday, Sunday, and Monday} = 177 + 183 + 354
   \]
   Let's calculate that:
   \[
   177 + 183 = 360
   \]
   \[
   360 + 354 = 714
   \]
   So, Andre picked a total of 714 pineapples from Saturday to Monday.

3. **Pineapples picked on Tuesday:**
   - Tuesday: Half of the total picked in the past 3 days:
   \[
   \text{Tuesday's pineapples} = \frac{714}{2} = 357 \text{ pineapples}
   \]

4. **Total pineapples picked from Saturday to Tuesday:**
   \[
   \text{Total for Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday} = 177 + 183 + 354 + 357

Therefore, Andre is going to make **$408**.",408.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. On Saturday, Andre picks 177 pineapples.
2. On Sunday, he picks 183 pineapples.
3. On Monday, he picks double the number of pineapples he did on Saturday:
   - So, on Monday, he picks 2 * 177 = 354 pineapples.
4. Now, let's calculate the total number of pineapples picked over the three days:
   - Total = 177 (Saturday) + 183 (Sunday) + 354 (Monday) = 714 pineapples.
5. On Tuesday, he picks half the amount of what he picked in the past 3 days combined:
   - So, on Tuesday, he picks 714 / 2 = 357 pineapples.
6. Now, let's calculate the total number of pineapples Andre has after Tuesday:
   - Total pineapples = 177 + 183 + 354 + 357 = 1071 pineapples.
7. On Wednesday, Andre is going to sell pineapples in boxes of 21 pineapples each:
   - The number of boxes he can sell = 1071 / 21 = 51 boxes (since 1071 divided by 21 equals 51 with no remainder).

5. **Total family consumption per day**:
   \[
   10 + 20 + 15 = 45 \text{ pizzas per day}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Monthly Pizza Consumption

1. **Number of days in a month**: 30 days
2. **Total consumption in one month**:
   \[
   45 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 1350 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate Consumption in the Second Month

The family goes on a diet in the second month, reducing their consumption as follows:

1. **First half of the month (15 days)**: Reduce consumption by 60%
   - Original daily consumption: 45 pizzas
   - Reduced consumption:
   \[
   45 \times (1 - 0.60) = 45 \times 0.40 = 18 \text{ pizzas per day}
   \]
   - Total for the first half of the month:
   \[
   18 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 270 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

2. **Second half of the month (15 days)**: Reduce consumption by an additional 50% from the already reduced amount
   - New daily consumption after the first reduction:
   \[
   18 \times (1 - 0.50) = 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \text{ pizzas per day}
   \]
   - Total for the second half of the month:
   \[
   9 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

### Step 4: Calculate Total Consumption in the Second Month

1. **Total consumption in the second month**:
   \[
   270 + 135 = 405 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

### Step 5: Calculate Total Consumption Over Two Months

1. **Total consumption over two months**:
   \[
   1350 \text{ pizzas (first month)} + 405 \text{ pizzas (second month)} = 1755 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

Thus, the total number of pizzas the family eats in two months is \(\boxed{1755}\).",1755.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily pizza consumption:**
   - The uncle eats 10 pizzas per day.
   - The spouse eats 20 pizzas per day.
   - The total pizzas eaten by the uncle and spouse is:
     \[
     10 + 20 = 30 \text{ pizzas}
     \]
   - The grandchild eats two-fourths (which is the same as one-half) of the combined number of pizzas:
     \[
     \text{Grandchild's consumption} = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ pizzas}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total daily pizza consumption for the family is:
     \[
     30 + 15 = 45 \text{ pizzas}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total consumption for the first month:**
   - There are 30 days in a month.
   - The total number of pizzas eaten in the first month is:
     \[
     45 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 1350 \text{ pizzas}
     \]

3. **Calculate the consumption for the second month:**
   - For the first half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by 60%:
     - The reduced consumption is:
     \[
     45 \text{ pizzas} \times (1 - 0.60) = 45 \times 0.40 = 18 \text{ pizzas/day}
     \]
     - Total for the first half of the month:
     \[
     18 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 270 \text{ pizzas}
     \]

   - For the second half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by an additional 50% from the already reduced amount:
     - The new consumption is:
     \[
     18 \text{ pizzas} \times (1 - 0.50) = 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \text{ pizzas/day}
     \]
     - Total for the second half of the month:
     \[
     9 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ pizzas}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total consumption for the second month:**
   - Total for the second month is:
   \[
   270 + 135 = 405 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total consumption for both months:**
   - Total for both months is:
   \[
   1350 + 405 = 1755 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

The answer is 1755.",1755.0,1,0,1,1755.0,,,

After accounting for the 700 seats for graduate, 450 seats for the faculty attending, and reserving 50 seats for the event's staff, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?",12.0,"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive to give to their friends and family, we first need to determine how many seats are available for guests after accounting for the seats reserved for graduates, faculty, and staff.

1. **Total capacity of the Sports Arena**: 9600 seats
2. **Seats reserved for graduates**: 700 seats
3. **Seats reserved for faculty**: 450 seats
4. **Seats reserved for staff**: 50 seats

Now, we will calculate the total number of seats that are reserved:

\[
\text{Total reserved seats} = \text{Seats for graduates} + \text{Seats for faculty} + \text{Seats for staff}
\]
\[
\text{Total reserved seats} = 700 + 450 + 50 = 1200 \text{ seats}
\]

Next, we will subtract the total reserved seats from the total capacity to find out how many seats are available for guests:

\[
\text{Available seats for guests} = \text{Total capacity} - \text{Total reserved seats}
\]
\[
\text{Available seats for guests} = 9600 - 1200 = 8400 \text{ seats}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many tickets each graduate can receive. Since there are 700 graduates, we will divide the available seats for guests by the number of graduates:

\[
\text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{\text{Available seats for guests}}{\text{Number of graduates}}
\]
\[
\text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{8400}{700} = 12
\]

Thus, each graduate would receive **12 tickets** to give to their friends and family.",12.0,1,"Let's think step by step.  
The total capacity of the Sports Arena is 9600 people.  
We need to account for the seats that are reserved:  
- 700 seats for graduates  
- 450 seats for faculty  
- 50 seats for event staff  

First, we calculate the total number of reserved seats:  
700 + 450 + 50 = 1200 reserved seats.  

Next, we subtract the reserved seats from the total capacity:  
9600 - 1200 = 8400 seats available for friends and family.  

Now, we need to determine how many graduates there are. Since the problem does not specify the number of graduates, we will assume that each graduate can give tickets to their friends and family.  

If we denote the number of graduates as G, then the number of tickets each graduate would receive is:  
8400 / G.  

Since we do not have a specific number for G, we cannot provide a numerical answer for how many tickets each graduate would receive. However, the formula for the number of tickets per graduate is:  
8400 / G.  

The answer is 8400 / G (where G is the number of graduates).",8400.0,0,1,1,12.0,"--- Beginning of the template ---

From the rest, Mohammed can only respond to 2 less than the 1/2 of them. How many emails does Mohammed respond to in a 6 day work week? Mohammed work overtime on the last day so he can respond to 10% more emails than usual.",61.0,"To find out how many emails Mohammed responds to in a 6-day work week, we can break the problem down into steps.

1. **Calculate the number of emails that require a response each day:**
   - Mohammed receives 30 emails a day.
   - 20% of those emails don't require a response.
   - The number of emails that don't require a response is:
     \[
     0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ emails}
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of emails that require a response is:
     \[
     30 - 6 = 24 \text{ emails}
     \]

2. **Determine how many emails Mohammed can respond to:**
   - Mohammed can respond to 2 less than half of the emails that require a response.
   - Half of the emails that require a response is:
     \[
     \frac{24}{2} = 12
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of emails he can respond to is:
     \[
     12 - 2 = 10 \text{ emails}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of emails he responds to in a regular 5-day work week:**
   - In a regular 5-day work week, the total number of emails he responds to is:
     \[
     10 \text{ emails/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ emails}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of emails he responds to on the last day (overtime day):**
   - On the last day, he can respond to 10% more emails than usual.
   - 10% of the usual number of emails he responds to is:
     \[
     0.10 \times 10 = 1 \text{ email}
     \]
   - Therefore, on the last day, he responds to:
     \[
     10 + 1 = 11 \text{ emails}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of emails he responds to in the 6-day work week:**
   - The total number of emails he responds to in the 6-day work week is:
     \[
     50 \text{ emails (first 5 days)} + 11 \text{ emails (last day)} = 61 \text{ emails}
     \]

Thus, the total number of emails Mohammed responds to in a 6-day work week is **61 emails**.",61.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Mohammed receives 30 emails a day.
2. 20% of those emails don't require any response. 
   - To find out how many emails don't require a response, we calculate 20% of 30:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ emails}
   \]
3. Now, we find out how many emails require a response:
   \[
   30 - 6 = 24 \text{ emails}
   \]
4. Mohammed can respond to 2 less than half of the emails that require a response. First, we calculate half of 24:
   \[
   \frac{24}{2} = 12
   \]
5. Now, we subtract 2 from this amount:
   \[
   12 - 2 = 10 \text{ emails}
   \]
6. So, on a regular day, Mohammed responds to 10 emails.

7. Now, we need to calculate how many emails he responds to in a 6-day work week:
   \[
   10 \text{ emails/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ emails}
   \]

8. On the last day, Mohammed works overtime and can respond to 10% more emails than usual. First, we calculate 10% of 10:
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } 10 = 0.10 \times 10 = 1 \text{ email}
   \]
9. Now, we add this to the usual number of emails he responds to:
   \[
   10 + 1 = 11 \text{ emails}
   \]

10. Finally, we add the emails he responds to on the last day to the total from the first 5 days:
    \[
    60 + 11 = 71 \text{ emails}

Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of oatmeal cookies and did not properly account for the condition of selling 3 less than half of them.
Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Percentage misunderstanding
- Incorrect assumptions
Instructions:
1. Calculate the total number of cookies baked in a week (50 cookies/day * 7 days).
2. Determine the number of chocolate chip cookies (30% of total cookies).
3. Calculate the number of oatmeal cookies (total cookies - chocolate chip cookies).
4. Find half of the oatmeal cookies and subtract 3 to find how many are sold.
5. Multiply the daily sales by the number of days in the week to find the total sales.
Advice:
- Always read the problem carefully to identify all conditions.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each part step-by-step.

[Example Input]
Question: Sarah bakes 50 cookies every day. 30% of those cookies are chocolate chip, and the rest are oatmeal. From the oatmeal cookies, she can only sell 3 less than half of them. How many oatmeal cookies does Sarah sell in a week if she bakes cookies for 5 days?
Wrong answer: I calculated that Sarah bakes 50 cookies a day, so 30% of 50 is 15 chocolate chip cookies. This means she has 35 oatmeal cookies. I then said she sells 17 oatmeal cookies (which is half of 35) instead of calculating correctly. 

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of oatmeal cookies sold by not correctly applying the ""3 less than half"" condition. I mistakenly took half of the oatmeal cookies without subtracting 3.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect application of conditions
- Percentage misunderstanding

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total number of cookies baked in the given time frame (days).
2. Determine the number of chocolate chip cookies using the percentage given.
3. Calculate the number of oatmeal cookies by subtracting the chocolate chip cookies from the total.
4. Apply the condition of selling ""3 less than half"" to find the number of oatmeal cookies sold.
5. Ensure to check each step for accuracy.

Advice:
- Always read the problem carefully to understand all conditions.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each part step-by-step.
- Double-check calculations, especially when applying conditions or percentages.

Solution:
Sarah bakes 50 cookies a day for 5 days, totaling 250 cookies. 30% of 50 is 15 chocolate chip cookies, so she bakes 35 oatmeal cookies each day. Over 5 days, she has 175 oatmeal cookies. Half of 175 is 87.5, and subtracting 3 gives 84. Therefore, Sarah sells 84 oatmeal cookies in a week.

I miscalculated the number of emails Mohammed responds to by not correctly applying the conditions regarding the emails that require responses and the overtime on the last day. I also failed to account for the total number of emails he receives over the 6-day work week properly.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect application of conditions
- Percentage misunderstanding
- Overtime miscalculation

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the total number of emails received in 6 days:**
   \[
   \text{Total emails} = 30 \text{ emails/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ emails}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of emails that don't require a response:**
   \[
   \text{Emails without response} = 20\% \text{ of } 180 = 0.20 \times 180 = 36 \text{ emails}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of emails that require a response:**
   \[
   \text{Emails requiring response} = 180 - 36 = 144 \text{ emails}
   \]

4. **Calculate half of the emails that require a response:**
   \[
   \text{Half of emails requiring response} = \frac{144}{2} = 72 \text{ emails}
   \]

5. **Determine the number of emails Mohammed can respond to:**
   \[
   \text{Emails responded to} = 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ emails}
   \]

6. **Calculate the number of emails responded to on the last day with overtime:**
   - First, find 10% more than the usual number of emails responded to:
   \[
   \text{10% more} = 0.10 \times 70 = 7 \text{ emails}
   \]
   - Therefore, on the last day, he responds to:
   \[
   \text{Emails responded to on last day} = 70 + 7 = 77 \text{ emails}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total number of emails responded to over the week:**
   - For the first 5 days:
   \[
   \text{Total for 5 days} = 70 \text{ emails/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 350 \text{ emails}
   \]
   - Adding the last day:
   \[
   \text{Total emails responded to} = 350 + 77 = 427 \text{ emails}
   \]

### Final Answer:
Mohammed responds to **427 emails** in a 6-day work week.

### Instructions for Future Problems:
1. Read the problem carefully to identify all conditions and requirements.
2. Calculate the total quantity (emails, cookies, etc.) over the specified time frame.
3. Determine the percentage of items that do not require action and subtract from the total.
4. Calculate the remaining items that require action.
5. Apply any additional conditions (like ""2 less than half"") accurately.
6. If there are special conditions for a specific day (like overtime), calculate those separately and add them to the total.
7. Double-check each step for accuracy and ensure all conditions are met.

### General Advice for Similar Problems:
- Break down the problem into manageable parts and solve each part step-by-step.
- Pay close attention to percentages and how they affect the total.
- Always verify calculations, especially when applying conditions or making adjustments for specific days.
- Keep track of the total throughout the problem to avoid losing sight of the overall goal.","--- Beginning of the template ---

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Ananya walks 24 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 miles of walking on the beach and 14 miles of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?",85.0,"To solve the problem, we need to determine Ananya's walking speeds on the beach and sidewalk, and then calculate the total time taken for her 24-mile walk.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( r \) be Ananya's original speed on the beach (in miles per hour).
   - Then her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2r \) (since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk).

2. **Adjust for Injury:**
   - After her injury, her speed on the beach becomes \( \frac{r}{2} \).
   - Her speed on the sidewalk becomes \( \frac{2r}{2} = r \).

3. **Time Spent on the Beach:**
   - We know that Ananya spends 50 minutes walking on the beach.
   - The distance she walks on the beach is 10 miles.
   - The time taken to walk on the beach can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]
   - Therefore, the time spent on the beach is:
     \[
     50 \text{ minutes} = \frac{10 \text{ miles}}{\frac{r}{2}} \implies 50 = \frac{20}{r}
     \]
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     r = \frac{20}{50} = \frac{2}{5} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

4. **Calculate Speed After Injury:**
   - After the injury, her speed on the beach is:
     \[
     \frac{r}{2} = \frac{2/5}{2} = \frac{1}{5} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]
   - Her speed on the sidewalk is:
     \[
     r = \frac{2}{5} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

5. **Time Spent on the Sidewalk:**
   - The distance she walks on the sidewalk is 14 miles.
   - The time taken to walk on the sidewalk is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{14 \text{ miles}}{\frac{2}{5} \text{ miles per minute}} = 14 \times \frac{5}{2} = 35 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Total Time for the Walk:**
   - The total time for the entire 24-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = 50 \text{ minutes} + 35 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Ananya to complete her 24-mile walk is \( \boxed{85} \) minutes.",85.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Ananya walks a total of 24 miles every day, which includes 10 miles on the beach and 14 miles on the sidewalk.

2. We know that Ananya spends 50 minutes walking on the beach. 

3. Let's find her speed on the beach. Since she walks 10 miles in 50 minutes, we can calculate her speed on the beach:
   - Speed on the beach = Distance / Time = 10 miles / (50 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) = 10 miles / (50/60) hours = 10 miles / (5/6) hours = 10 * (6/5) = 12 miles per hour.

4. Since Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, her original speed on the sidewalk would be:
   - Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * Speed on the beach = 2 * 12 miles per hour = 24 miles per hour.

5. However, due to her injury, her speed has decreased by half. Therefore, her current speeds are:
   - Speed on the beach after injury = 12 miles per hour / 2 = 6 miles per hour.
   - Speed on the sidewalk after injury = 24 miles per hour / 2 = 12 miles per hour.

6. Now, let's calculate the time it takes for her to walk the remaining 14 miles on the sidewalk:
   - Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 14 miles / 12 miles per hour = 14 / 12 hours = 7/6 hours.

7. To convert this time into minutes:
   - Time on the sidewalk in minutes = (7/6 hours) * 60 minutes/hour = 70 minutes.

8. Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the entire 24-mile walk:
   - Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk = 50 minutes + 70 minutes = 120 minutes.

[Example Input]
Question: Sarah rides her bike for 30 miles, which includes 12 miles on a dirt path and 18 miles on a paved road. On the paved road, Sarah rides at three times the speed she does on the dirt path. After a minor accident, her speed on both paths is reduced to two-thirds of her original speed. If she spends 20 minutes on the dirt path, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 30-mile ride, in minutes?
Wrong answer: I calculated that Sarah took 40 minutes to complete the ride by simply adding the time spent on the dirt path to the time spent on the paved road without adjusting for her reduced speed. 

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the time spent on the paved road by not considering the reduction in speed after the accident. I assumed her original speed without adjusting for the new speed, leading to an incorrect total time.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Speed adjustment
- Time calculation

Instructions:
1. Identify the total distance and the distances for each segment (dirt path and paved road).
2. Determine the original speeds for both segments based on the relationship given (e.g., speed on paved road is three times that on dirt path).
3. Adjust the speeds according to the injury (reduce both speeds to two-thirds).
4. Calculate the time spent on the dirt path using the formula: time = distance/speed.
5. Calculate the time spent on the paved road using the same formula.
6. Add the times from both segments to find the total time for the ride.

Advice:
- Always check if there are any changes in speed or conditions that affect the calculations.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to ensure each segment is calculated correctly.
- Double-check the relationships between different segments of the problem to avoid miscalculations.

Solution:
To find the time spent on the dirt path, if Sarah spends 20 minutes on it, we can calculate her speed on the dirt path. Let’s denote her original speed on the dirt path as \( x \). Then her speed on the paved road is \( 3x \). After the accident, her speed on the dirt path becomes \( \frac{2}{3}x \) and on the paved road \( 2x \). 

The distance on the dirt path is 12 miles, so:
Time on dirt path = \( \frac{12}{\frac{2}{3}x} = \frac{12 \cdot 3}{2x} = \frac{36}{2x} = \frac{18}{x} \) hours.

Since she spends 20 minutes (or \( \frac{1}{3} \) hours) on the dirt path, we can set \( \frac{18}{x} = \frac{1}{3} \) to find \( x \):
\( 18 = \frac{1}{3}x \) → \( x = 54 \) miles/hour (original speed on dirt path).

Now, her speed on the paved road is \( 3x = 162 \) miles/hour. After the accident, her speed on the dirt path is \( \frac{2}{3} \cdot 54 = 36 \) miles/hour and on the paved road is \( 2 \cdot 54 = 108 \) miles/hour.

Now, calculate the time on the paved road:
Time on paved road = \( \frac{18}{108} = \frac{1}{6} \) hours = 10 minutes.

Total time = 20 minutes (dirt path) + 10 minutes (paved road) = 30 minutes.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Ananya walks 24 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 miles of walking on the beach and 14 miles of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 120.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I miscalculated the time spent on the sidewalk by not properly adjusting for Ananya's reduced speed after her injury. I assumed her original speed without considering the decrease in speed, which led to an incorrect total time for the entire walk.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Speed adjustment
- Time calculation

### Solution:
1. **Identify the total distance and distances for each segment**:
   - Total distance = 24 miles
   - Distance on the beach = 10 miles
   - Distance on the sidewalk = 14 miles

2. **Determine the original speeds**:
   - Let \( x \) be Ananya's original speed on the beach.
   - Then her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2x \).

3. **Adjust the speeds according to the injury**:
   - After the injury, her speed on the beach becomes \( \frac{1}{2}x \) and on the sidewalk becomes \( x \).

4. **Calculate the time spent on the beach**:
   - Given that Ananya spends 50 minutes on the beach, we can find her original speed:
   \[
   \text{Time on beach} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \implies 50 \text{ minutes} = \frac{10}{\frac{1}{2}x}
   \]
   - Converting 50 minutes to hours: \( \frac{50}{60} = \frac{5}{6} \) hours.
   \[
   \frac{5}{6} = \frac{10}{\frac{1}{2}x} \implies \frac{5}{6} = \frac{20}{x} \implies 5x = 120 \implies x = 24 \text{ miles/hour (original speed on the beach)}
   \]

5. **Calculate the adjusted speeds**:
   - Speed on the beach after injury: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \) miles/hour.
   - Speed on the sidewalk after injury: \( 24 \) miles/hour (original) becomes \( 12 \) miles/hour.

6. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk**:
   \[
   \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{14}{12} \text{ hours} = \frac{7}{6} \text{ hours} = 70 \text{ minutes}.
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time for the walk**:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 50 \text{ minutes} + 70 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}.
   \]

### Instructions:
1. Identify the total distance and the distances for each segment.
2. Define the original speeds based on the relationships given in the problem.
3. Adjust the speeds according to any changes mentioned (e.g., injury).
4. Calculate the time spent on each segment using the formula: time = distance/speed.
5. Convert all time measurements to the same unit (e.g., minutes).
6. Add the times from both segments to find the total time for the walk.

### General Advice:
- Always check for any changes in speed or conditions that may affect the calculations.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to ensure each segment is calculated correctly.
- Double-check the relationships between different segments of the problem to avoid miscalculations.
- Keep track of units and conversions to ensure consistency throughout the calculations.","--- Beginning of the template ---

[Example Input]
Question: Sarah rides her bike for 30 miles, which includes 12 miles on a dirt path and 18 miles on a paved road. On the paved road, Sarah rides at three times the speed she does on the dirt path. After a minor accident, her speed on both paths is reduced to two-thirds of her original speed. If she spends 20 minutes on the dirt path, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 30-mile ride, in minutes?
Wrong answer: I calculated that Sarah took 40 minutes to complete the ride by simply adding the time spent on the dirt path to the time spent on the paved road without adjusting for her reduced speed. 

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the time spent on the paved road by not considering the reduction in speed after the accident. I assumed her original speed without adjusting for the new speed, leading to an incorrect total time.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Speed adjustment
- Time calculation

Instructions:
1. Identify the total distance and the distances for each segment (dirt path and paved road).
2. Determine the original speeds for both segments based on the relationship given (e.g., speed on paved road is three times that on dirt path).
3. Adjust the speeds according to the injury (reduce both speeds to two-thirds).
4. Calculate the time spent on the dirt path using the formula: time = distance/speed.
5. Calculate the time spent on the paved road using the same formula.
6. Add the times from both segments to find the total time for the ride.

Advice:
- Always check if there are any changes in speed or conditions that affect the calculations.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to ensure each segment is calculated correctly.
- Double-check the relationships between different segments of the problem to avoid miscalculations.

Solution:
To find the time spent on the dirt path, if Sarah spends 20 minutes on it, we can calculate her speed on the dirt path. Let’s denote her original speed on the dirt path as \( x \). Then her speed on the paved road is \( 3x \). After the accident, her speed on the dirt path becomes \( \frac{2}{3}x \) and on the paved road \( 2x \). 

The distance on the dirt path is 12 miles, so:
Time on dirt path = \( \frac{12}{\frac{2}{3}x} = \frac{12 \cdot 3}{2x} = \frac{36}{2x} = \frac{18}{x} \) hours.

Since she spends 20 minutes (or \( \frac{1}{3} \) hours) on the dirt path, we can set \( \frac{18}{x} = \frac{1}{3} \) to find \( x \):
\( 18 = \frac{1}{3}x \) → \( x = 54 \) miles/hour (original speed on dirt path).

Now, her speed on the paved road is \( 3x = 162 \) miles/hour. After the accident, her speed on the dirt path is \( \frac{2}{3} \cdot 54 = 36 \) miles/hour and on the paved road is \( 2 \cdot 54 = 108 \) miles/hour.

Now, calculate the time on the paved road:
Time on paved road = \( \frac{18}{108} = \frac{1}{6} \) hours = 10 minutes.

Total time = 20 minutes (dirt path) + 10 minutes (paved road) = 30 minutes.

Elena finds 5 cookies. Mei finds twice as many as Elena. Xavier finds 2 less than Mei. Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier, and Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined. How many cookies are still hidden in the yard?",64.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of cookies**: Amelia had 11 dozen cookies.
   \[
   11 \text{ dozen} = 11 \times 12 = 132 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. **Cookies eaten by Amelia**: She ate 5 cookies for breakfast.
   \[
   132 - 5 = 127 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. **Cookies hidden in the yard**: After eating, Amelia hid 127 cookies in the yard.

4. **Cookies found by Elena**: Elena finds 5 cookies.
   \[
   \text{Elena's cookies} = 5
   \]

5. **Cookies found by Mei**: Mei finds twice as many as Elena.
   \[
   \text{Mei's cookies} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

6. **Cookies found by Xavier**: Xavier finds 2 less than Mei.
   \[
   \text{Xavier's cookies} = 10 - 2 = 8
   \]

7. **Cookies found by Mohammed**: Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier.
   \[
   \text{Mohammed's cookies} = \frac{8}{8} = 1
   \]

8. **Cookies found by Umar**: Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined.
   - First, calculate the total cookies found by Mei and Elena:
   \[
   \text{Mei's cookies} + \text{Elena's cookies} = 10 + 5 = 15
   \]
   - Now, calculate Umar's cookies:
   \[
   \text{Umar's cookies} = 15 + 2 \times 12 = 15 + 24 = 39
   \]

9. **Total cookies found**: Now, we sum up all the cookies found by each person:
   \[
   \text{Total found} = \text{Elena's cookies} + \text{Mei's cookies} + \text{Xavier's cookies} + \text{Mohammed's cookies} + \text{Umar's cookies}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total found} = 5 + 10 + 8 + 1 + 39 = 63
   \]

10. **Cookies still hidden in the yard**: Finally, we subtract the total cookies found from the total cookies hidden.
   \[
   \text{Cookies still hidden} = 127 - 63 = 64
   \]

Thus, the number of cookies still hidden in the yard is \(\boxed{64}\).",64.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Amelia initially had 11 dozen cookies. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we calculate the total number of cookies:
   \[
   11 \text{ dozen} = 11 \times 12 = 132 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. Amelia ate 5 cookies for breakfast. We subtract the cookies she ate from the total:
   \[
   132 - 5 = 127 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. Now, 127 cookies are hidden in the yard.

4. Elena finds 5 cookies. We subtract this from the total hidden:
   \[
   127 - 5 = 122 \text{ cookies left}
   \]

5. Mei finds twice as many cookies as Elena. Since Elena found 5 cookies:
   \[
   Mei = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cookies}
   \]

6. Now we subtract Mei's cookies from the total:
   \[
   122 - 10 = 112 \text{ cookies left}
   \]

7. Xavier finds 2 less than Mei. Since Mei found 10 cookies:
   \[
   Xavier = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ cookies}
   \]

8. We subtract Xavier's cookies from the total:
   \[
   112 - 8 = 104 \text{ cookies left}
   \]

9. Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier. Since Xavier found 8 cookies:
   \[
   Mohammed = \frac{8}{8} = 1 \text{ cookie}
   \]

10. We subtract Mohammed's cookies from the total:
    \[
    104 - 1 = 103 \text{ cookies left}
    \]

11. Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined. First, we calculate how many cookies Mei and Elena found together:
    \[
    \text{Mei} + \text{Elena} = 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ cookies}
    \]
    Now, two dozen is:
    \[
    2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ cookies}
    \]
    So, Umar finds:
    \[
    Umar = 15 + 24 = 39 \text{ cookies}
    \]

12. Finally, we subtract Umar's cookies from the total:
    \[
    103 - 39 = 64 \text{ cookies left}

The first 2 have 100 apartments each and the last one is 35% bigger than the other 2 combined. However, this week, 9 apartments from each of the first 2 complexes were vacant and did not require collection service. Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each place and he gets paid ₣0.5 per collection for each apartment. He also earns an additional 10% in tips. How much money does he make in a week?",1243.0,"To calculate how much money Oscar makes in a week, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of apartments in each complex.**
   - The first two complexes each have 100 apartments.
   - The total number of apartments in the first two complexes is:
     \[
     100 + 100 = 200 \text{ apartments}
     \]
   - The last complex is 35% bigger than the first two combined. Therefore, the number of apartments in the last complex is:
     \[
     200 + (0.35 \times 200) = 200 + 70 = 270 \text{ apartments}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of apartments Oscar services.**
   - The total number of apartments across all three complexes is:
     \[
     200 + 270 = 470 \text{ apartments}
     \]

3. **Account for the vacant apartments.**
   - There are 9 vacant apartments in each of the first two complexes, so the total number of vacant apartments is:
     \[
     9 + 9 = 18 \text{ vacant apartments}
     \]
   - The number of apartments that require collection service is:
     \[
     470 - 18 = 452 \text{ apartments}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of collections per week.**
   - Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week, so the total number of collections for the week is:
     \[
     452 \text{ apartments} \times 5 \text{ collections} = 2260 \text{ collections}
     \]

5. **Calculate the earnings from collections.**
   - Oscar earns ₣0.5 per collection, so his earnings from collections for the week are:
     \[
     2260 \text{ collections} \times 0.5 = ₣1130
     \]

6. **Calculate the tips.**
   - Oscar earns an additional 10% in tips on his earnings from collections:
     \[
     0.10 \times 1130 = ₣113
     \]

7. **Calculate the total earnings for the week.**
   - The total earnings for the week, including tips, is:

     1130 + 113 = ₣1243
     \]

Thus, Oscar makes **₣1243** in a week.",1243.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of apartments in the first two complexes:**
   - The first complex has 100 apartments.
   - The second complex also has 100 apartments.
   - Total for the first two complexes = 100 + 100 = 200 apartments.

2. **Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex:**
   - The third complex is 35% bigger than the first two combined.
   - The size of the first two combined is 200 apartments.
   - 35% of 200 = 0.35 * 200 = 70 apartments.
   - Therefore, the third complex has 200 + 70 = 270 apartments.

3. **Calculate the total number of apartments:**
   - Total apartments = 200 (first two complexes) + 270 (third complex) = 470 apartments.

4. **Account for the vacant apartments:**
   - Each of the first two complexes has 9 vacant apartments.
   - Total vacant apartments = 9 + 9 = 18 apartments.
   - Therefore, the number of apartments requiring collection = 470 - 18 = 452 apartments.

5. **Calculate the number of collections per week:**
   - Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each complex.
   - Total collections per week = 5 collections/week * 3 complexes = 15 collections.

6. **Calculate the payment per collection:**
   - Oscar earns ₣0.5 per collection for each apartment.
   - Total earnings from collections = 452 apartments * ₣0.5/collection = ₣226.

7. **Calculate the total earnings including tips:**
   - Oscar earns an additional 10% in tips on his total earnings.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Percentage increase
- Incorrect application of formulas
- Neglecting vacancies

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the total number of apartments:**
   - First two complexes: 100 apartments each = 100 + 100 = 200 apartments.
   - The last complex is 35% bigger than the first two combined:
     - 35% of 200 = 0.35 * 200 = 70 apartments.
     - Total apartments in the last complex = 200 + 70 = 270 apartments.
   - Total apartments = 200 + 270 = 470 apartments.

2. **Account for vacant apartments:**
   - Vacant apartments in the first two complexes: 9 from each = 9 + 9 = 18 vacant apartments.
   - Total occupied apartments = 470 - 18 = 452 apartments.

3. **Calculate the number of collections per week:**
   - Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each complex.
   - Total collections = 452 apartments * 5 collections = 2260 collections.

4. **Calculate the earnings from collections:**
   - Earnings from collections = 2260 collections * ₣0.5 per collection = ₣1130.

5. **Calculate tips:**
   - Tips = 10% of earnings from collections = 0.10 * ₣1130 = ₣113.

6. **Total earnings for the week:**

After 40 minutes from the start of the call, the price drops even more to ₺0.1 per two minutes. If your total bill is more than ₺25, you get a 20% discount on your total bill. How much would a 60-minute call cost?",24.0,"To calculate the cost of a 60-minute call from a phone booth with the given pricing structure, we will break down the call into three segments based on the pricing tiers:

1. **First 10 minutes**: 
   - Cost per minute: ₺0.8
   - Total cost for 10 minutes: 
     \[
     10 \text{ minutes} \times ₺0.8/\text{minute} = ₺8.0
     \]

2. **Next 30 minutes (from minute 11 to minute 40)**: 
   - Cost per minute: ₺0.7
   - Total cost for 30 minutes: 
     \[
     30 \text{ minutes} \times ₺0.7/\text{minute} = ₺21.0
     \]

3. **Last 20 minutes (from minute 41 to minute 60)**: 
   - Cost per two minutes: ₺0.1
   - Since there are 20 minutes, we have:
     \[
     \text{Number of two-minute intervals} = \frac{20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 10
     \]
   - Total cost for 20 minutes:
     \[
     10 \text{ intervals} \times ₺0.1/\text{interval} = ₺1.0
     \]

Now, we can sum the costs from all three segments to find the total bill:

\[
\text{Total cost} = ₺8.0 + ₺21.0 + ₺1.0 = ₺30.0
\]

Since the total bill is more than ₺25, we apply a 20% discount:

\[
\text{Discount} = 20\% \text{ of } ₺30.0 = 0.2 \times ₺30.0 = ₺6.0
\]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:

\[
\text{Final cost} = ₺30.0 - ₺6.0 = ₺24.0
\]

Thus, the cost of a 60-minute call is **₺24.0**.",24.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. For the first 10 minutes, the cost is ₺0.8 per minute.
   - Cost for the first 10 minutes = 10 minutes * ₺0.8/minute = ₺8.0.

2. For the next 30 minutes (from minute 11 to minute 40), the cost is ₺0.7 per minute.
   - Cost for the next 30 minutes = 30 minutes * ₺0.7/minute = ₺21.0.

3. For the last 20 minutes (from minute 41 to minute 60), the cost is ₺0.1 per two minutes.
   - Since there are 20 minutes, we can calculate how many two-minute intervals are in 20 minutes: 20 minutes / 2 minutes = 10 intervals.
   - Cost for the last 20 minutes = 10 intervals * ₺0.1/interval = ₺1.0.

4. Now, let's add up all the costs:
   - Total cost = ₺8.0 (first 10 minutes) + ₺21.0 (next 30 minutes) + ₺1.0 (last 20 minutes) = ₺30.0.

5. Since the total bill is more than ₺25, we get a 20% discount on the total bill.
   - Discount = 20% of ₺30.0 = 0.20 * ₺30.0 = ₺6.0.

6. Finally, we subtract the discount from the total bill:

If they work for 8 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?",50.0,"To find out what percentage of the janitor's day is spent cleaning rooms, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the time taken to clean one room after the injury:**
   - Originally, it took 6 minutes per room.
   - Now, it takes twice as long: 
     \[
     6 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 12 \text{ minutes per room}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time required to clean all 200 rooms:**
   - Total time for 200 rooms:
     \[
     200 \text{ rooms} \times 12 \text{ minutes per room} = 2400 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Convert total cleaning time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
     \[
     \frac{2400 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 40 \text{ hours}

4. **Determine the total working hours over 10 days:**
   - The janitor works 8 hours a day for 10 days:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours/day} \times 10 \text{ days} = 80 \text{ hours}

1. The janitor has to clean a total of 200 rooms.
2. It normally takes them 6 minutes to clean one room. However, due to their injury, it now takes them twice as long:
   - New time per room = 6 minutes * 2 = 12 minutes.
3. To find the total time needed to clean all 200 rooms, we multiply the time per room by the number of rooms:
   - Total time = 200 rooms * 12 minutes/room = 2400 minutes.
4. Next, we convert the total cleaning time from minutes to hours:
   - Total time in hours = 2400 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 40 hours.
5. The janitor works for 8 hours a day. To find out how many days it will take to clean all the rooms, we divide the total cleaning hours by the hours worked per day:
   - Days needed = 40 hours / 8 hours/day = 5 days.
6. Now, we need to find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning rooms. Since they work 8 hours a day and it takes them 8 hours to clean all the rooms in 5 days, we can calculate the percentage of time spent cleaning in one day:

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly by assuming that the janitor would be able to clean all the rooms in a single day without properly calculating the total time required and the total working time available. I did not account for the increased time per room due to the injury, nor did I correctly calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Time conversion
- Percentage calculation
- Assumption error

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the time needed to clean one room:**
   - Due to the injury, it now takes the janitor 6 minutes × 2 = 12 minutes per room.

2. **Calculate the total time needed to clean all rooms:**
   - Total time = Number of rooms × Time per room = 200 rooms × 12 minutes/room = 2400 minutes.

3. **Convert the working hours per day into minutes:**
   - The janitor works for 8 hours a day, which is 8 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

4. **Determine the total working minutes over the given days:**
   - Total working time = Working minutes per day × Number of days = 480 minutes/day × 10 days = 4800 minutes.

5. **Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning rooms:**
   - Percentage of the day spent cleaning = (Total cleaning time ÷ Total working time) × 100
   - Percentage = (2400 minutes ÷ 4800 minutes) × 100 = 50%.

As the skillet of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 70 pop in the first 10 seconds of cooking, then 2 times that amount in the next 10 seconds. The kernels increase to 4 times the initial popping rate in the next 10 seconds. In the final 10 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 10 seconds. After Noah takes the skillet off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. Noah gives one-fifth of the made popcorn to his brother Luca. How many more pieces of popcorn does Noah have to eat than his brother?",399.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Popping in the first 10 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels popped = 70

2. **Popping in the second 10 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels popped = 2 times the first 10 seconds = \(2 \times 70 = 140\)

3. **Popping in the third 10 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels popped = 4 times the first 10 seconds = \(4 \times 70 = 280\)

4. **Popping in the fourth 10 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels popped = half the rate of the previous 10 seconds = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 280 = 140\)

5. **Total kernels popped during the cooking:**
   - Total = \(70 + 140 + 280 + 140\)
   - Total = \(630\)

6. **Kernels that pop from residual heat:**
   - Number of kernels popped = a quarter of the number that popped in the final 10 seconds = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 140 = 35\)

7. **Total kernels popped (including residual heat):**
   - Total = \(630 + 35 = 665\)

8. **Popcorn given to Luca:**
   - Noah gives one-fifth of the total popcorn to Luca = \(\frac{1}{5} \times 665 = 133\)

9. **Popcorn Noah has left:**
   - Noah's remaining popcorn = Total popcorn - Popcorn given to Luca
   - Noah's remaining popcorn = \(665 - 133 = 532\)

10. **Difference in popcorn between Noah and Luca:**
    - Difference = Noah's popcorn - Luca's popcorn
    - Difference = \(532 - 133 = 399\)

Thus, Noah has **399 more pieces of popcorn** to eat than his brother Luca.",399.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. In the first 10 seconds, 70 kernels pop.
2. In the next 10 seconds, the amount that pops is 2 times the first amount:
   - 2 * 70 = 140 kernels.
3. In the following 10 seconds, the popping rate increases to 4 times the initial rate:
   - 4 * 70 = 280 kernels.
4. In the final 10 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate of the previous 10 seconds:
   - Half of 280 = 280 / 2 = 140 kernels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the cooking:

- Total popped = 70 + 140 + 280 + 140 = 630 kernels.

5. After cooking, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds also pop from the residual heat:
   - A quarter of 140 = 140 / 4 = 35 kernels.

Now, let's add this to the total popped:

- Total kernels after residual heat = 630 + 35 = 665 kernels.

6. Noah gives one-fifth of the made popcorn to his brother Luca:
   - One-fifth of 665 = 665 / 5 = 133 kernels.

7. Now, let's find out how many kernels Noah has left after giving some to Luca:
   - Kernels Noah has = 665 - 133 = 532 kernels.

If there are 30 bricks in the building in total, what percentage of bricks are green?",50.0,"To find the percentage of green bricks in the building, we first need to determine the number of each type of brick.

1. **Identify the number of white bricks:**
   - There are 5 white bricks.

2. **Determine the number of orange bricks:**
   - The problem states there are twice as many orange bricks as white bricks. Therefore, the number of orange bricks is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ orange bricks}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of white and orange bricks:**
   - The total number of white and orange bricks is:
   \[
   5 \text{ (white)} + 10 \text{ (orange)} = 15 \text{ bricks}

4. **Find the total number of bricks in the building:**
   - The total number of bricks in the building is given as 30.

5. **Calculate the number of green bricks:**
   - To find the number of green bricks, we subtract the total number of white and orange bricks from the total number of bricks:
   \[
   30 \text{ (total)} - 15 \text{ (white and orange)} = 15 \text{ green bricks}

6. **Calculate the percentage of green bricks:**
   - The percentage of green bricks is calculated by dividing the number of green bricks by the total number of bricks and then multiplying by 100:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of green bricks} = \left( \frac{15 \text{ (green)}}{30 \text{ (total)}} \right) \times 100

4. **Calculate the average age of all three**:
   The average age of Olivia, Bodhi, and Keisha is given by:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{O + B + K}{3} = \frac{35 + 59 + 20}{3} = \frac{114}{3} = 38
   \]

5. **Determine how much younger Keisha is than the average age**:
   To find out how much younger Keisha is than the average age, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Average age} - K = 38 - 20 = 18
   \]

Thus, Keisha is **18 years younger** than the average age of all three.",18.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine Olivia's current age**: 
   - In 7 years, Olivia will be 42 years old.
   - Therefore, her current age is 42 - 7 = 35 years old.

2. **Determine Bodhi's current age**: 
   - Olivia is currently 24 years younger than Bodhi.
   - So, Bodhi's current age is 35 + 24 = 59 years old.

3. **Determine Keisha's current age**: 
   - Olivia is currently 15 years older than Keisha.
   - Therefore, Keisha's current age is 35 - 15 = 20 years old.

4. **Calculate the average age of Olivia, Bodhi, and Keisha**: 
   - The sum of their ages is 35 (Olivia) + 59 (Bodhi) + 20 (Keisha) = 114 years.
   - There are 3 people, so the average age is 114 / 3 = 38 years.

5. **Determine how much younger Keisha is than the average age**: 
   - The average age is 38 years.
   - Keisha's age is 20 years.
   - The difference is 38 - 20 = 18 years.

The answer is 18.",18.0,1,0,1,18.0,,,
