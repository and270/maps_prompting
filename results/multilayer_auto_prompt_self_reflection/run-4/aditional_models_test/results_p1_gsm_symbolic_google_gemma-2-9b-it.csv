1. **Calculate initial water in mango drink:** 16 liters * (1/9) = 1.78 liters
2. **Calculate initial water in apple drink:** 14 liters * (1/2) = 7 liters
3. **Calculate water remaining after spillage:** 1.78 liters - 7 liters = -5.22 liters (This indicates an error in the problem setup, as you cannot have negative water)
4. **Adjust for the addition of water:** -5.22 liters + 7 liters = 1.78 liters
5. **Calculate total volume of the final mix:** 16 liters - 7 liters + 14 liters + 7 liters = 20 liters
6. **Calculate the total water in the final mix:** 1.78 liters + 7 liters = 8.78 liters
7. **Calculate the percentage of water in the final mix:** (8.78 liters / 20 liters) * 100% = 43.9%

Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 3.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answer of 3.0 minutes was incorrect because I failed to properly calculate the rate at which the fog bank is moving and then apply that rate to the new distance. I likely made a simple arithmetic error or didn't fully understand the relationship between the given information and the question being asked.

**Error Keywords:**

- **Rate:** I didn't accurately determine the fog bank's speed.
- **Distance:** I didn't correctly calculate the distance the fog needs to cover.
- **Time:** I didn't apply the rate and distance to find the correct time.

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Calculate the fog bank's speed:**
   - It covers 3 miles in 41 minutes.
   - Speed = Distance / Time = 3 miles / 41 minutes = 0.073 miles per minute (approximately).

2. **Calculate the distance for 1/3 of the city:**
   - The city is 18 miles across.
   - 1/3 of the city's distance is 18 miles / 3 = 6 miles.

3. **Calculate the time to cover 1/3 of the city:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 6 miles / 0.073 miles per minute = 82.19 minutes (approximately).



## Instructions for Future Success:

1. **Identify the rate:** Determine how fast something is moving (distance per unit of time).
2. **Identify the distance:**  Figure out how far something needs to travel.
3. **Identify the time:**  Determine the time it takes to cover the distance at the given rate.
4. **Use the formula:**  Remember that Speed = Distance / Time, and rearrange it as needed to solve for the unknown variable.
5. **Double-check your units:** Ensure that your units are consistent throughout the calculation.

## General Advice:

- **Read the problem carefully:** Understand what information is given and what is being asked.
- **Draw a diagram:** Visualizing the problem can help you understand the relationships between the variables.
- **Break down the problem:** Divide it into smaller, more manageable steps.
- **Check your answer:** Does it make sense in the context of the problem?","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answer of 15.0 was incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the total TV time spent on each day and then sum them up. I likely made a mistake in converting the time units or adding them incorrectly.

**Error Keywords:**

- Time
- Calculation
- Addition
- Units

## Solution:

Here's the breakdown of Noah's TV watching time:

* **Saturday & Sunday:** 4 hours/episode * 2 episodes/night * 2 nights = 16 hours
* **Monday:** Let 'x' represent the number of 15-minute episodes. Total time = 15 minutes/episode * x episodes = 0.25x hours. 
* **Tuesday:** 3 hours + 0.75 hours = 3.75 hours
* **Wednesday:** 5 hours/episode * 2 episodes = 10 hours
* **Thursday:** 15 minutes/episode * 4 episodes = 1 hour

**Total TV Time:** 16 hours + 0.25x hours + 3.75 hours + 10 hours + 1 hour = 30.75 + 0.25x hours

**Setting up the equation:** 30.75 + 0.25x = 24 hours

**Solving for x:**

1. Subtract 30.75 from both sides: 0.25x = -6.75
2. Divide both sides by 0.25: x = -27

Since we can't have negative episodes, this indicates an error in our calculations or the problem setup. 


## Instructions for Future Problems:

1. **Identify the relevant time units:** Determine if the problem uses hours, minutes, seconds, etc. 
2. **Convert all units to a consistent format:** Choose one unit (e.g., hours) and convert all other units accordingly. 
3. **Break down the problem:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable chunks. Calculate the time spent on each activity separately. 
4. **Add up the time spent:** Carefully sum the time spent on each activity to find the total time. 
5. **Double-check your calculations:** Carefully review your work for any errors in conversion, addition, or subtraction. 

## General Advice:

* **Read the problem carefully:** Understand the context and identify the key information. 
* **Visualize the problem:** Draw a diagram or timeline to help you visualize the sequence of events. 
* **Show your work:** Writing down each step clearly can help you identify errors. 
* **Don't rush:** Take your time and work through the problem systematically.

Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer

**Explanation:**

My previous answers were incorrect because I failed to accurately break down the total TV time across each day and then isolate the time spent on the 15-minute episodes on Monday. I likely made assumptions about the distribution of viewing time without carefully calculating it.

**Error Keywords:**

- Time
- Calculation
- Distribution
- Units

**Solution:**

1. **Saturday & Sunday:** 4 hours/episode * 2 episodes/night * 2 nights = 16 hours
2. **Monday:** Let 'x' be the number of 15-minute episodes watched. Total time = 15 minutes/episode * x episodes = 15x minutes.
3. **Tuesday:** 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 45 minutes = 225 minutes = 3.75 hours
4. **Wednesday:** 2 episodes * 5 hours/episode = 10 hours
5. **Thursday:** 4 episodes * 15 minutes/episode = 60 minutes = 1 hour
6. **Total TV Time:** 16 hours + 15x minutes + 3.75 hours + 10 hours + 1 hour = 24 hours
7. **Convert to Minutes:** 16 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 3.75 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 10 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 1 hour * 60 minutes/hour = 960 minutes + 225 minutes + 600 minutes + 60 minutes = 1845 minutes
8. **Equation:** 1845 minutes + 15x minutes = 24 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1440 minutes
9. **Solve for x:** 15x = 1440 minutes - 1845 minutes = -405 minutes
10. **No Solution:**  The equation results in a negative value for x, indicating an error in the problem setup or the provided information. It's impossible to watch a negative number of episodes.


**Instructions:**

1. **Break Down Time:**  Separate the total TV time into individual days and episode types.
2. **Convert Units:** Ensure all times are in the same unit (minutes).
3. **Set Up Equation:** Create an equation representing the total TV time based on the known information and the unknown variable (e.g., number of 15-minute episodes).
4. **Solve for Variable:**  Use algebra to solve for the unknown variable.
5. **Check for Validity:** Ensure the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.

**Advice:**

- **Read Carefully:** Pay close attention to the wording of the problem to avoid misinterpreting information.
- **Organize Information:** Create a table or list to track the time spent on each day and episode type.
- **Double-Check Calculations:**  Carefully verify all calculations to avoid errors.
- **Consider Logic:**  If the solution seems illogical or impossible, re-examine the problem and your calculations.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

**Explanation:**

My previous answers were incorrect because I struggled to accurately break down the total TV time across all days and then isolate the time spent watching 15-minute episodes on Monday. I likely made calculation errors and didn't systematically track the time spent on each day.

**Error Keywords:**

- Time
- Calculation
- Breakdown
- Isolation

**Instructions:**

1. **Calculate total time for each day:**  
    - Saturday & Sunday: 4 hours/episode * 2 episodes/day * 2 days = 16 hours
    - Monday:  Let 'x' be the number of 15-minute episodes. Total time = x * 15 minutes = x/4 hours
    - Tuesday: 3 hours + 45 minutes = 3.75 hours
    - Wednesday: 5 hours/episode * 2 episodes = 10 hours
    - Thursday: 4 episodes * 15 minutes/episode = 60 minutes = 1 hour
2. **Sum the time spent on each day:** 16 hours + x/4 hours + 3.75 hours + 10 hours + 1 hour = 30.75 + x/4 hours
3. **Set the sum equal to the total TV time:** 30.75 + x/4 hours = 24 hours
4. **Solve for x:**
    - Subtract 30.75 from both sides: x/4 hours = -6.75 hours
    - Multiply both sides by 4: x = -27 hours 

**Advice:**

If she used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.",504.0,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Find the unit ratio:**

* The ratio of sugar to water is 63:14.  Simplify this ratio by dividing both sides by 7: 9:2

**2. Determine the amount of water:**

* Since Fatima used 760 teaspoons total, and the sugar-to-water ratio is 9:2, we can represent the total ratio parts as 9+2 = 11. 
* Each ratio part represents 760 teaspoons / 11 parts = 69.09 teaspoons (approximately).

* Fatima used 2 parts of water, so she used 2 * 69.09 teaspoons = 138.18 teaspoons of water.

**3. Calculate the amount of milk:**

* The ratio of milk to water is 9:7. 
* Since Fatima used 138.18 teaspoons of water, she used 9/7 * 138.18 teaspoons of milk = 180.25 teaspoons of milk.

**4. Calculate the amount of sugar:**

* Fatima used 9 parts of sugar, so she used 9 * 69.09 teaspoons = 621.81 teaspoons of sugar.



**Therefore, Fatima used approximately 621.81 teaspoons of sugar.**",621.81,0,"A: Let's think step by step...

**1. Find the number of cups of water:**

*  The ratio of sugar to water is 63:14. This means for every 63 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 14 cups of water.
*  Let 'x' represent the number of cups of water used.
*  Set up a proportion: 63/14 = 760 / x
*  Solve for x:  x = (760 * 14) / 63 = 168 cups of water

**2. Find the number of tablespoons of milk:**

*  The ratio of milk to water is 9:7.
*  For every 7 cups of water, she uses 9 tablespoons of milk.
*  Calculate the number of tablespoons: (9 tablespoons / 7 cups) * 168 cups = 228 tablespoons of milk

**3. Calculate the total amount of sugar, water, and milk:**

*  Total = 760 teaspoons (sugar) + 168 cups (water) + 228 tablespoons (milk)

**4.  Convert tablespoons of milk to teaspoons:**

*  There are approximately 3 teaspoons in 1 tablespoon.
*  Milk in teaspoons: 228 tablespoons * 3 teaspoons/tablespoon = 684 teaspoons

**5. Calculate the total amount of sugar, water, and milk in teaspoons:**

*  Total in teaspoons: 760 teaspoons (sugar) + 168 cups (water) * 4 teaspoons/cup + 684 teaspoons (milk) 

**Note:** We need to convert cups of water to teaspoons. Assuming 1 cup = 4 teaspoons, we get:

*  Total in teaspoons: 760 teaspoons + (168 cups * 4 teaspoons/cup) + 684 teaspoons = 760 + 672 + 684 = 2116 teaspoons

If she used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.",504.0,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Find the unit ratio:**

* The ratio of sugar to water is 63:14.  Simplify this ratio by dividing both sides by 7: 9:2

**2. Determine the amount of water:**

* Since Fatima used 760 teaspoons total, and the sugar-to-water ratio is 9:2, we can represent the total ratio parts as 9+2 = 11. 
* Each ratio part represents 760 teaspoons / 11 parts = 69.09 teaspoons (approximately).

* Fatima used 2 parts of water, so she used 2 * 69.09 teaspoons = 138.18 teaspoons of water.

**3. Calculate the amount of milk:**

* The ratio of milk to water is 9:7. 
* Since Fatima used 138.18 teaspoons of water, she used 9/7 * 138.18 teaspoons of milk = 180.25 teaspoons of milk.

**4. Calculate the amount of sugar:**

* Fatima used 9 parts of sugar, so she used 9 * 69.09 teaspoons = 621.81 teaspoons of sugar.



**Therefore, Fatima used approximately 621.81 teaspoons of sugar.**",621.81,0,"A: Let's think step by step...

**1. Find the number of cups of water:**

*  The ratio of sugar to water is 63:14. This means for every 63 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 14 cups of water.
*  Let 'x' represent the number of cups of water used.
*  Set up a proportion: 63/14 = 760 / x
*  Solve for x:  x = (760 * 14) / 63 = 168 cups of water

**2. Find the number of tablespoons of milk:**

*  The ratio of milk to water is 9:7.
*  For every 7 cups of water, she uses 9 tablespoons of milk.
*  Calculate the number of tablespoons: (9 tablespoons / 7 cups) * 168 cups = 228 tablespoons of milk

**3. Calculate the total amount of sugar, water, and milk:**

*  Total = 760 teaspoons (sugar) + 168 cups (water) + 228 tablespoons (milk)

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","You are absolutely right! My previous answer of 760 was incorrect.  I made a fundamental error by not properly understanding the ratios and the fact that the total amount includes sugar, water, and milk. 

Here's a breakdown of the problem and the correct solution:

**1. Understand the Ratios:**

* **Sugar to Water:** 63:14  (This means for every 63 teaspoons of sugar, Fatima uses 14 cups of water)
* **Milk to Water:** 9 tablespoons : 7 cups

**2.  Find the Unit for Comparison:**

*  To make calculations easier, let's find a common unit for comparing the ratios.  We can use cups of water.

**3.  Express Ratios in Terms of Cups of Water:**

* **Sugar to Water:** 63 teaspoons / 14 cups = 4.5 teaspoons per cup of water
* **Milk to Water:** 9 tablespoons / 7 cups = 1.29 tablespoons per cup of water (approximately)

**4.  Set Up an Equation:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of cups of water Fatima used.
* Total sugar: 4.5x teaspoons
* Total milk: 1.29x tablespoons
* Total ingredients: 4.5x + 1.29x + x = 760 

**5. Solve for x:**

* Combine like terms: 6.79x = 760
* Divide both sides by 6.79: x ≈ 112 cups of water

**6. Calculate Total Sugar:**

* Total sugar: 4.5 * 112 ≈ 504 teaspoons

Now, look at this question:
Question: Luis is rolling a 20-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row?
Your initial answer was: A: Let's think step by step...

This question is a bit tricky because it involves two different probabilities.  Here's how we can break it down:

**1. Probability of rolling a number greater than 10:**

* There are 10 numbers greater than 10 on a 20-sided die.
* There are 20 total possible outcomes.
* The probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is 10/20 = 1/2 = 50%.

**2. Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row:**

*  There are 10 odd numbers on a 20-sided die.
*  The probability of rolling one odd number is 10/20 = 1/2.
*  To get four odd numbers in a row, we multiply the probability of each individual roll: (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16

**3.  Finding the difference:**

*  We want to know how much *more likely* it is to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll four odd numbers in a row.
*  Subtract the probability of rolling four odd numbers from the probability of rolling a number greater than 10: 50% - (1/16) * 100% 

*  Calculate the result to get the final answer.



Let me know if you'd like me to calculate the final percentage difference!
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer

My initial answer was incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the probability difference. While I correctly identified the individual probabilities of rolling a number greater than 10 and rolling four odd numbers in a row, I made a mistake when subtracting them to find the difference. 

**Error Keywords:**

- Probability calculation error
- Subtraction error
-  Misinterpretation of ""how much more likely""

## Corrected Solution

**1. Probability of rolling a number greater than 10:**

* There are 10 numbers greater than 10 on a 20-sided die.
* There are 20 total possible outcomes.
* Probability = (Favorable outcomes) / (Total possible outcomes) = 10/20 = 1/2 = 50%

**2. Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row:**

* There are 10 odd numbers on a 20-sided die.
* Probability of rolling one odd number = 10/20 = 1/2
* Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16

**3. Finding the difference:**

*  We want to express the difference as a percentage.
*  Difference in probability = 50% - (1/16) * 100% 
*  Calculate: 50% - 6.25% = 43.75%


**Answer:** It is 43.75% more likely to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll four odd numbers in a row.

## Instructions for Future Success

**Explanation:**

My previous answers (100.0 and 10.0) were incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the probabilities of both events. I likely made a hasty judgment without carefully considering the possibilities for each scenario. 

**Error Keywords:**

- Probability
- Conditional Probability
-  Miscalculation

**Instructions:**

1. **Define the Events:** Clearly identify the two events: rolling a number greater than 10 and rolling four odd numbers in a row.
2. **Calculate Individual Probabilities:** Determine the probability of each event separately.
    *  **Event 1:** Probability of rolling a number greater than 10.
    *  **Event 2:** Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row.
3. **Compare Probabilities:**  Calculate the difference between the two probabilities.
4. **Express as a Percentage:** Convert the difference in probabilities to a percentage.

**Advice:**

- **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
- **Visualize possibilities:** Use a diagram or list to represent all possible outcomes for each event.
- **Double-check calculations:** Carefully verify each step of the calculation to avoid errors.

**Solution:**

1. **Event 1:** Probability of rolling a number greater than 10.
   - There are 10 numbers greater than 10 on a 20-sided die.
   - Probability = 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5

2. **Event 2:** Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row.
   - Probability of rolling an odd number = 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5
   - Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16 = 0.0625

3. **Difference:** 0.5 - 0.0625 = 0.4375

4. **Percentage:** 0.4375 * 100% = 43.75%

Question: There are 80 fourth-graders at Oak Ridge School. 34 of them are girls. On Thursday, 8 fourth-grade girls and 7 fourth-grade boys were absent. On Thursday, what percentage of the present fourth grade students were boys?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: None
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer

My previous answers were incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the number of present students and then determine the percentage of boys among them. I likely made a mistake in either subtracting the absent students or calculating the percentage. 

**Keywords describing the errors:**

* **Calculation:**  The core issue was a mistake in the arithmetic involved.
* **Percentage:** I struggled with correctly applying the percentage formula.
* **Contextual Understanding:** I didn't fully grasp the problem's requirement to focus on the *present* student population.

## Corrected Solution

**Step 1: Calculate the number of present girls:**

* Start with the total number of girls: 34
* Subtract the absent girls: 34 - 8 = 26 girls present

**Step 2: Calculate the number of present boys:**

* Start with the total number of boys: 80 - 34 = 46 boys
* Subtract the absent boys: 46 - 7 = 39 boys present

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of present students:**

* Add the present girls and boys: 26 + 39 = 65 students

**Step 4: Calculate the percentage of boys:**

* Divide the number of present boys by the total number of present students: 39 / 65 = 0.6
* Multiply by 100 to express the answer as a percentage: 0.6 * 100 = 60%


**Answer:** 60% of the present fourth-grade students were boys.

Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","Let's break down Theo's pineapple and kiwi saga! 🍍🥝 

**Why I Was Wrong:**

I struggled to keep track of the changing quantities of pineapples and kiwis throughout Theo's shopping spree. I likely made errors in translating the words into mathematical operations, especially when dealing with ""more"" and ""fewer"" quantities. 

**Keywords Describing My Errors:**

* **Changing quantities:** This highlights the core issue – the numbers weren't constant.
* **Comparison:** Phrases like ""eight times as many"" and ""19 fewer"" required careful comparisons.
* **Addition/Subtraction:**  I likely mixed up addition and subtraction when dealing with the changes in quantities. 

**Correct Solution:**

1. **Initial Quantities:**
   * Kiwis: 25 
   * Pineapples: 25 * 8 = 200 

2. **Kiwi Purchase:**
   * Kiwis: 25 + 63 = 88

3. **Pineapple Purchase:**
   * Pineapples: 200 - 19 = 181 

4. **Second Kiwi Purchase:**
   * Kiwis: 88 - 22 = 66 

5. **Final Pineapple Purchase:**
   * Pineapples: 181 + 13 = 194

6. **Total:**
   * Pineapples: 194
   * Kiwis: 66
   * Total: 194 + 66 = 260



**Instructions for Future Success:**

1. **Define Variables:** Let 'k' represent kiwis and 'p' represent pineapples. 
2. **Break Down Steps:** Analyze each sentence separately, identifying the operation(s) needed. 
3. **Write Equations:** Translate each step into an equation using the defined variables. 
4. **Solve Step-by-Step:** Work through the equations sequentially, keeping track of intermediate values. 
5. **Check Units:** Ensure units are consistent throughout the solution. 
6. **Final Calculation:** Add the final quantities of kiwis and pineapples. 

**General Advice:**

* **Read Carefully:** Pay close attention to keywords and phrases. 
* **Visualize:** Draw diagrams or charts to represent the changing quantities. 
* **Check Your Work:** Substitute values back into the equations to verify accuracy.

How many pineapples and kiwis does Theo have in the house combined?",349.0,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the initial number of pineapples:**

* Theo has 8 times as many pineapples as kiwis, so he has 8 * 25 kiwis = 200 pineapples.

**2. Calculate the new number of kiwis:**

* Theo bought 63 more kiwis, so he now has 25 kiwis + 63 kiwis = 88 kiwis.

**3. Calculate the new number of pineapples:**

* Theo bought 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis, so he has 88 kiwis - 19 = 69 pineapples.

**4. Calculate the number of kiwis bought in the last purchase:**

* Two times the number of kiwis is 88 kiwis * 2 = 176 kiwis.
* Theo bought 22 fewer than that, so he bought 176 kiwis - 22 kiwis = 154 kiwis.

**5. Calculate the total number of pineapples after the last purchase:**

* His total number of pineapples is now 200 - 19 + 13 = 194 pineapples.

**4. Calculate the number of kiwis Theo bought:**

* Theo bought 2 times the number of kiwis minus 22, so he bought (2 * 88) - 22 = 174 kiwis. 

**5. Calculate the total number of pineapples and kiwis:**

* Theo has 194 pineapples + 174 kiwis = 368 pineapples and kiwis.

At the gift shop, saltwater taffy was on sale for ""Buy 16 kgs at $23 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/2 off."" She scooped up 23 kgs. She also bought a mixed bag of starfish for $11.0 and 17 keychains that were $20.0 each. Ananya then donated $5 at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Ananya have left?",361.0,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the cost of the taffy:**

*  Ananya bought 23 kgs of taffy, which is more than the 16 kgs needed for the discount.
*  The discount applies to 4 kgs at half price: 4 kgs * ($23/kg / 2) = $46
*  The cost of the remaining taffy is: (23 kgs - 4 kgs) * $23/kg = 19 kgs * $23/kg = $437
*  The total cost of the taffy is: $437 + $46 = $483

**2. Calculate the cost of the keychains:**

*  17 keychains * $20.00/keychain = $340.00

**3. Calculate Ananya's total spending:**

*  $483 (taffy) + $11.00 (starfish) + $340.00 (keychains) + $5.00 (donation) = $849.00

Question: Ananya went to the boardwalk for vacation. Her parents gave her $1200 to buy whatever she wanted. At the gift shop, saltwater taffy was on sale for ""Buy 16 kgs at $23 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/2 off."" She scooped up 23 kgs. She also bought a mixed bag of starfish for $11.0 and 17 keychains that were $20.0 each. Ananya then donated $5 at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Ananya have left?
Your initial answer was: A: Let's think step by step...

**1. Calculate the cost of the saltwater taffy:**

*  Ananya bought 23 kgs of taffy.
*  The sale price is $23 per kg for the first 16 kgs, so that's 16 * $23 = $368.
*  The remaining 23 - 16 = 7 kgs are half price, so they cost 7 * ($23 / 2) = $7.75.
*  The total cost of the taffy is $368 + $7.75 = $375.75

**2. Calculate the cost of the keychains:**

*  Ananya bought 17 keychains at $20 each, so they cost 17 * $20 = $340.

**3. Calculate Ananya's total spending:**

*  Taffy: $375.75

    * 7 kg at half price ($23/2): 7 * ($23/2) = $80.50
    * Total taffy cost: $368.00 + $80.50 = $448.50

2. **Calculate the cost of the keychains:** 
    * 17 keychains at $20/each: 17 * $20 = $340.00

3. **Calculate Ananya's total spending:** 
    * Taffy: $448.50
    * Starfish: $11.00
    * Keychains: $340.00
    * Charity donation: $5.00
    * Total spending: $448.50 + $11.00 + $340.00 + $5.00 = $804.50

4. **Calculate Ananya's remaining money:** 
    * Starting money: $1200.00
    * Total spending: $804.50
    * Remaining money: $1200.00 - $804.50 = $395.50

Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer

**Explanation:**

My previous answers were incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the discounted price of the taffy and made mistakes in adding up the total expenses. I didn't properly apply the ""Buy 16 kgs at $23 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/2 off"" offer.

**Error Keywords:**

- Discount
- Unit price
- Bulk purchase
- Total cost calculation

**Solution:**

Here's the breakdown of Ananya's expenses:

1. **Taffy:**
    - 16 kgs at $23/kg = $368
    - 4 kgs at half price ($23/kg / 2) = $46
    - Total taffy cost = $368 + $46 = $414

2. **Starfish:** $11.00

3. **Keychains:** 17 keychains * $20.00/keychain = $340.00

4. **Total Expenses:** $414 + $11 + $340 = $765.00

5. **Money Remaining:** $1200 - $765 - $5 = $430.00


**Instructions for Future Problems:**

1. **Identify Discount Types:** Carefully read the discount offer to understand if it's a percentage off, a fixed amount off, or a ""buy one get one"" deal.
2. **Calculate Individual Discounts:** Apply the discount to each item separately before calculating the total cost.

How much money does Ananya have left?",361.0,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the cost of the taffy:**

*  Ananya bought 23 kgs of taffy, which is more than the 16 kgs needed for the discount.
*  The discount applies to 4 kgs at half price: 4 kgs * ($23/kg / 2) = $46
*  The cost of the remaining taffy is: (23 kgs - 4 kgs) * $23/kg = 19 kgs * $23/kg = $437
*  The total cost of the taffy is: $437 + $46 = $483

**2. Calculate the cost of the keychains:**

*  17 keychains * $20.00/keychain = $340.00

**3. Calculate Ananya's total spending:**

*  $483 (taffy) + $11.00 (starfish) + $340.00 (keychains) + $5.00 (donation) = $849.00

**4. Calculate Ananya's remaining money:**

*  $1200.00 (starting money) - $849.00 (spending) = $351.00



**Answer:** Ananya has $351.00 left.",351.0,0,"A: Let's think step by step...

**1. Calculate the cost of the saltwater taffy:**

*  Ananya bought 23 kgs of taffy.
*  The sale price is $23 per kg for the first 16 kgs, so that's 16 * $23 = $368.
*  The remaining 23 - 16 = 7 kgs are half price, so they cost 7 * ($23 / 2) = $7.75.
*  The total cost of the taffy is $368 + $7.75 = $375.75

**2. Calculate the cost of the keychains:**

*  Ananya bought 17 keychains at $20 each, so they cost 17 * $20 = $340.

**3. Calculate Ananya's total spending:**

*  Taffy: $375.75
*  Starfish: $11.00
*  Keychains: $340.00
*  Charity donation: $5.00
*  Total spending: $375.75 + $11.00 + $340.00 + $5.00 = $731.75

**4. Calculate Ananya's remaining money:**

*  Starting money: $1200.00
*  Total spending: $731.75
*  Remaining money: $1200.00 - $731.75 = $468.25

My previous answers were incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the cost of the saltwater taffy. I didn't properly apply the ""Buy 16 kgs at $23 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/2 off"" discount. 

**Error Keywords:**

- Discount
- Unit Pricing
- Quantity Calculation

**Corrected Solution:**

1. **Saltwater Taffy:**
    - 16 kg at $23/kg = 16 * $23 = $368
    - Discount on 4 kg: $23/kg * 0.5 = $11.50 per kg
    - Cost of discounted taffy: 4 kg * $11.50/kg = $46
    - Total taffy cost: $368 - $46 = $322

2. **Total Spending:**
    - Taffy: $322
    - Starfish: $11
    - Keychains: 17 * $20 = $340
    - Total spent: $322 + $11 + $340 = $673

3. **Remaining Money:**
    - Starting money: $1200
    - Charity donation: $5
    - Money left: $1200 - $673 - $5 = $522


**Instructions for Future Problems:**

1. **Identify Discounts:** Carefully read the discount terms and determine the specific conditions and calculations involved.
2. **Break Down Costs:** Separate the cost of individual items and calculate the total cost for each category.
3. **Apply Discounts:**  Calculate the discount amount accurately based on the discount terms and subtract it from the original price.
4. **Sum Total Costs:** Add up the costs of all items, including any applicable discounts.

Now, look at this question:
Question: The vending machine sells crackers for 75 cents, gum for 100 cents, and pretzels for $7. Andre spent $100 and got 4 bags of crackers, 7 packs of pretzels, and had 3% of his money left in change. How many gum did he buy?
Your initial answer was: A: Let's think step by step. 

1. **Calculate the cost of the crackers:** 4 bags of crackers * 75 cents/bag = 300 cents 
2. **Calculate the cost of the pretzels:** 7 packs of pretzels * $7/pack = $49 
3. **Convert the total spent to cents:** $100 * 100 cents/$1 = 10000 cents
4. **Calculate the amount spent on crackers and pretzels:** 300 cents + 4900 cents = 5200 cents
5. **Calculate the amount spent on gum:** 10000 cents - 5200 cents = 4800 cents
6. **Calculate the number of gum packs:** 4800 cents / 100 cents/pack = 48 packs 


 
 **Therefore, Andre bought 48 packs of gum.**

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My initial answer was incorrect because I failed to account for the 3% of Andre's money left as change. This led me to overestimate the amount spent on gum. 

**Error Keywords:**

-  **Misinterpretation:** I didn't fully understand the meaning of ""had 3% of his money left in change.""
-  **Calculation Error:** I incorrectly calculated the amount spent on gum by not factoring in the change.

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Calculate the amount spent:**  Since Andre had 3% of his money left, he spent 100% - 3% = 97% of his $100.
2. **Calculate the amount spent in cents:** 97% of $100 is (97/100) * $100 = $97, which is equal to 9700 cents.
3. **Calculate the cost of the crackers:** 4 bags of crackers * 75 cents/bag = 300 cents.
4. **Calculate the cost of the pretzels:** 7 packs of pretzels * $7/pack = $49, which is equal to 4900 cents.
5. **Calculate the total cost of crackers and pretzels:** 300 cents + 4900 cents = 5200 cents.
6. **Calculate the amount spent on gum:** 9700 cents - 5200 cents = 4500 cents.
7. **Calculate the number of gum packs:** 4500 cents / 100 cents/pack = 45 packs.


**Therefore, Andre bought 45 packs of gum.**

p1,gsm-symbolic,google/gemma-2-9b-it,"The area of Kai's rectangular office is 225 square feet. If the length of his room is 16 feet longer that its width, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?",68.0,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'w' represent the width of the office.
* Let 'l' represent the length of the office.

**2. Set Up Equations:**

* We know that l = w + 16 (The length is 16 feet longer than the width)
* We also know that area = length * width, so w * l = 225 

**3. Solve for the Width:**

* Substitute the first equation into the second equation: w * (w + 16) = 225
* Expand the equation: w2 + 16w = 225
* Move all terms to one side: w2 + 16w - 225 = 0
* Factor the quadratic equation: (w + 25)(w - 9) = 0
* Solve for w: 
    * w + 25 = 0  -->  w = -25 (We discard this solution since width cannot be negative)
    * w - 9 = 0  -->  w = 9 feet

**4. Solve for the Length:**

* Use the equation l = w + 16 
* Substitute w = 9: l = 9 + 16 
* Therefore, l = 25 feet.

**5. Calculate the Perimeter:**

* Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 * (length + width)
* Perimeter = 2 * (25 + 9) 
* Perimeter = 2 * 34 
* Perimeter = 68 feet.



**Answer:** The perimeter of Kai's office is 68 feet.",68.0,1,"A: Let's think step by step...

1. **Define variables:**
   * Let 'w' represent the width of the room.
   * Let 'l' represent the length of the room.

2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * We know l = w + 16 (The length is 16 feet longer than the width)
   * We know l * w = 225 (The area of a rectangle is length times width)

3. **Solve for the width (w):**
   * Substitute the first equation (l = w + 16) into the second equation: (w + 16) * w = 225

","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous response was completely off-topic and irrelevant to the math problem presented.  I failed to recognize the question as a word problem requiring algebraic manipulation and instead treated it as a request for creative writing. This demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the task at hand.

**Error Keywords:**

-  **Task Misunderstanding:**  I failed to correctly identify the type of problem.
-  **Contextual Blindness:** I ignored the numerical information and focused on the narrative elements.
-  **Irrelevant Response:** My answer did not address the actual question.

## Corrected Solution:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let James's current age be represented by ""j""
* Let Jasmine's current age be represented by ""s""

**2. Set Up Equations:**

* We know j = 8 (James's current age)
* In 4 years, Jasmine will be 4 times James's current age: s + 4 = 4(j)

**3. Solve for Jasmine's Current Age:**

* Substitute j = 8 into the second equation: s + 4 = 4(8)
* Simplify: s + 4 = 32
* Subtract 4 from both sides: s = 28

**4. Calculate Ages in 6 Years:**

* James's age in 6 years: j + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14
* Jasmine's age in 6 years: s + 6 = 28 + 6 = 34

**5. Calculate the Average:**

* Average age in 6 years: (j + 6 + s + 6) / 2 = (14 + 34) / 2 = 48 / 2 = 24


**Answer:** The average age of James and Jasmine in 6 years will be 24.

Reflection 1: None
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answer of 328 was incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the total wool needed for the grandchildren's items and my own jackets. I likely made a mistake in either adding up the wool needed for each item type or in accounting for the number of grandchildren and jackets.

**Error Keywords:**

- Calculation
- Multiplication
- Item Count

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Wool for grandchildren's items:**
    - Ponchos: 4 grandchildren * 18 skeins/poncho = 72 skeins
    - Hats: 4 grandchildren * 17 skeins/hat = 68 skeins
    - Beanies: 4 grandchildren * 15 skeins/beanie = 60 skeins
    - Booties: 4 grandchildren * 8 skeins/booties = 32 skeins
    - Gloves: 4 grandchildren * 16 skeins/gloves = 64 skeins
    - **Total for grandchildren:** 72 + 68 + 60 + 32 + 64 = 306 skeins

2. **Wool for Emma's jackets:**
    - 2 jackets * 11 skeins/jacket = 22 skeins

3. **Total wool needed:**
    - 306 skeins (grandchildren) + 22 skeins (jackets) = 328 skeins

## Instructions for Future Accuracy:

1. **Break down the problem:** Identify all the individual tasks and quantities involved.
2. **Calculate for each task:** Determine the wool needed for each type of item for each person.
3. **Account for item counts:** Multiply the wool per item by the number of items needed.
4. **Sum all quantities:** Add up the wool needed for all tasks and individuals.
5. **Double-check:** Review your calculations and ensure all items and quantities are accounted for.

## General Advice for Similar Problems:

- **Read carefully:** Pay close attention to all details and requirements in the problem.
- **Organize information:** Create a table or list to track items, quantities, and calculations.
- **Use clear labels:** Label your calculations and variables to avoid confusion.
- **Check units:** Ensure units are consistent throughout the calculation.

**Explanation:** 

I incorrectly calculated the percentage of green spools. I likely added the green spools together and divided by the total number of spools, but failed to multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage. 

**Error Keywords:**

- Percentage Calculation
- Division
- Multiplication 

**Instructions:**

1. **Calculate the total number of green spools:** Add the light green and dark green spools.
2. **Calculate the total number of spools:** Add all types of spools together. 
3. **Divide the total green spools by the total spools:** This gives you the proportion of green spools.
4. **Multiply the proportion by 100:** This converts the proportion to a percentage. 

**Advice:** 

- Always remember to multiply the proportion by 100 to express the answer as a percentage. 
- Double-check your calculations at each step to avoid accumulation of errors. 

**Solution:**

1. **Total green spools:** 17 (light green) + 27 (dark green) = 44 spools
2. **Total spools:** 44 (green) + 49 (light black) + 17 (dark black) + (17 * 10) (magenta) = 44 + 49 + 17 + 170 = 280 spools
3. **Proportion of green spools:** 44 (green spools) / 280 (total spools) = 0.1571 
4. **Percentage of green spools:** 0.1571 * 100 = 15.71%

Now, look at this question:
Question: Alejandro is feeding his livestock grain. Each goat needs 9 kilograms, and each alpaca needs 3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs. Each cow eats as much as a goat and alpaca eat combined. If there are 21 goats, 7 alpacas, and 21 cows, how many kilograms of grain does Alejandro need?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 808.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

**Explanation:** My previous answer was incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the grain needed for each type of animal and then sum the total. I likely made a mistake in the calculation for alpaca grain needs and/or in combining the amounts for goats, alpacas, and cows.

**Error Keywords:**

- Calculation
- Units
- Multi-step problem
- Variable quantities

**Solution:**

1. **Alpaca Grain:**
    - Twice the amount a goat eats: 9 kg * 2 = 18 kg
    - 3 kg less than twice a goat's amount: 18 kg - 3 kg = 15 kg per alpaca

2. **Cow Grain:**
    - Goat grain + Alpaca grain: 9 kg + 15 kg = 24 kg per cow

3. **Total Grain Needed:**
    - Goats: 21 goats * 9 kg/goat = 189 kg
    - Alpacas: 7 alpacas * 15 kg/alpaca = 105 kg
    - Cows: 21 cows * 24 kg/cow = 504 kg
    - Total: 189 kg + 105 kg + 504 kg = **808 kg**


**Instructions for Future:**

1. **Break down the problem:** Identify the key information about each animal type and their grain needs.
2. **Define variables:**  Use variables to represent the unknown quantities (e.g., alpaca grain).
3. **Write out equations:** Translate the word problem into mathematical equations.
4. **Solve for each variable:** Calculate the grain needed for each animal type separately.
5. **Sum the results:** Add the grain needed for all animal types to find the total.
6. **Double-check units:** Ensure all calculations are consistent with the given units (kilograms).

**General Advice:**

- **Read carefully:** Pay close attention to the wording and details of the problem.
- **Visualize:** Try to create a mental picture of the situation to better understand the relationships between the quantities.
- **Check your work:**  Review your calculations and ensure they make logical sense in the context of the problem.

Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

**Explanation:** 

I incorrectly calculated the amount of grain needed for the alpacas and cows. I failed to accurately apply the given relationships between the animals' grain requirements. 

**Error Keywords:**

- Calculation
- Units
- Word Interpretation 
- Comparison 

**Solution:**

1. **Alpaca Grain:** 
    - Goats eat 9 kg: Twice that amount is 9 kg * 2 = 18 kg.
    - Alpacas eat 3 kg less than twice a goat's amount: 18 kg - 3 kg = 15 kg.

2. **Cow Grain:**
    - Goats eat 9 kg, alpacas eat 15 kg: Combined, they eat 9 kg + 15 kg = 24 kg. 

3. **Total Grain:**
    - Goats: 21 goats * 9 kg/goat = 189 kg
    - Alpacas: 7 alpacas * 15 kg/alpaca = 105 kg
    - Cows: 21 cows * 24 kg/cow = 504 kg
    - Total: 189 kg + 105 kg + 504 kg = **808 kg** 



**Instructions:**

1. **Identify Key Information:** Carefully read the problem and identify the amount of grain each animal needs, along with the number of each animal. 
2. **Break Down Complex Relationships:** Deconstruct complex relationships between animals' grain needs (e.g., twice the amount, 3 kg less) into smaller, manageable steps. 
3. **Calculate Individual Needs:** Calculate the grain needed for each type of animal separately. 
4. **Sum Total Grain:** Add the grain needed for all animals to find the total amount. 

**General Advice:**

- **Pay close attention to units:** Ensure units are consistent throughout the calculation. 
- **Double-check calculations:** Carefully verify each step to avoid errors. 
- **Visual aids:** Consider drawing diagrams or charts to represent the relationships between animals and their grain needs. 
- **Practice:** Solving word problems regularly helps improve understanding and accuracy.

   - One-fifth of 800 beds = (1/5) * 800 = 160 out-of-service beds

3. **Calculate total unavailable beds:**
   - Total unavailable beds = occupied beds + out-of-service beds 
   - Total unavailable beds = 100 + 160 = 260 beds

4. **Calculate total available beds:**
   - Total available beds = total beds - total unavailable beds
   - Total available beds = 800 - 260 = 540 beds

5. **Calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks:**
   - Patients admitted per day = 35
   - Patients admitted in 2 weeks = 35 patients/day * 14 days = 490 patients

6. **Calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:**
   - Unoccupied beds = total available beds - patients admitted 
   - Unoccupied beds = 540 beds - 490 patients = 50 beds

Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: None
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous attempts failed because I didn't properly calculate the number of plants Mei needed and didn't account for the discount correctly. I likely made several calculation errors and didn't follow a clear step-by-step process.

## Error Keywords:

- **Spacing Calculation:**  Misunderstanding the required spacing between plants.
- **Quantity Calculation:**  Inaccurately determining the total number of plants needed.
- **Discount Application:**  Incorrectly applying the discount based on the purchase quantity.
- **Unit Conversion:**  Potential issues with converting between feet and plant widths.

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Calculate the total space needed:** 143 feet (flower bed length) / 3 feet (plant width) = 47.67. Since we can't have fractions of plants, round up to 48 spaces needed for plants.

2. **Calculate the total number of plants:** 48 spaces needed - 8 plants owned = 40 plants to buy.

3. **Apply the discount:** Mei needs to buy more than 2 plants, so she gets a €5 discount.

4. **Calculate the cost before discount:** 40 plants * €9/plant = €360.

5. **Calculate the final cost:** €360 - €5 discount = €355.



## Instructions for Future Success:

1. **Carefully read the problem:**  Identify all relevant information, including units and spacing requirements.
2. **Draw a diagram:**  Visualizing the flower bed and plant spacing can help with calculations.
3. **Break down the problem:**  Divide the problem into smaller, manageable steps.

Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","You are absolutely right! My previous answers were incorrect. I made a few key errors:

* **Incorrect Calculation of Plants Needed:** I didn't properly account for the spacing between plants when figuring out how many Mei needed. 
* **Discount Misapplication:** I didn't correctly apply the discount when she buys more than 2 plants.

Here's a step-by-step solution with the corrections:

**1. Calculate the total space needed:**

* Mei's flower bed is 143 feet long.

**2. Calculate the space each plant and its spacing take up:**

* Each plant is 3 feet wide.
* Mei needs 13 feet of space between each plant.
* Total space per plant unit: 3 feet (plant) + 13 feet (spacing) = 16 feet

**3. Determine the number of plants needed:**

* Divide the total flower bed length by the space per plant unit: 143 feet / 16 feet/plant = 8.9375 plants.
* Since Mei can't have a fraction of a plant, she needs to buy 9 plants.

**4. Calculate the cost before the discount:**

* Mei needs 9 plants - 8 plants (she already owns) = 1 more plant.
* Cost of one plant: €9
* Total cost before discount: €9

**5. Apply the discount:**

* Since Mei is buying more than 2 plants, she gets a €5 discount.
* Final cost: €9 - €5 = €4


**Answer:** Mei will spend €4 at the store.",".

Now, look at this question:
Question: Mei has a flower bed that is 143 feet long. Mei wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Mei's flowers grow 3feet wide so she needs to leave 13 feet between every plant (including the plants width). Mei already owns 8 flowers. Each flowering plant costs €9 at the store. However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a €5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Mei spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Swimming Leggings:** The leggings cost $14 more than the jersey, so they cost $20 + $14 = $34.

2. **Cleats:** The cleats were on sale for three-fourths of the original price, so they cost $36 * (3/4) = $27.

3. **Headbands:** The headbands cost $12, and Sophia had a $1 coupon, so they cost $12 - $1 = $11.

4. **Duffle Bag:** The duffle bag had a 50% discount, so it cost $40 * (1/2) = $20.

5. **Total Cost:**  Adding up the cost of all the items: $20 + $34 + $27 + $11 + $20 + $3 = $115.

Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

**Explanation:** I made several errors in my previous attempts. I failed to account for the preparation time before each extra class, and I incorrectly calculated the extra learning time on the weekend. I also didn't properly consider the total number of minutes spent in regular classes.

**Error Keywords:**

- Time calculation
- Preparation time
- Weekly total
- Weekend learning

**Instructions:**

1. **Calculate extra class time:** Multiply the number of extra classes by the length of each class and the preparation time.
2. **Calculate regular class time:** Multiply the number of regular periods by the length of each period.
3. **Calculate total weekly class time:** Add the extra class time and regular class time.
4. **Calculate weekend learning time:** Divide the total weekly class time by 9.
5. **Calculate total weekly learning time:** Add the total weekly class time and the weekend learning time.
6. **Convert total minutes to hours:** Divide the total weekly learning time in minutes by 60.

**Advice:**

- Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
- Pay close attention to all details and units of measurement.
- Double-check your calculations at each step.
- Visualize the problem to better understand the relationships between different elements.

**Solution:**

1. **Extra class time:** 3 extra classes * 30 minutes/class + 3 extra classes * 15 minutes/class = 90 minutes + 45 minutes = 135 minutes
2. **Regular class time:** 6 periods * 30 minutes/period = 180 minutes
3. **Total weekly class time:** 135 minutes + 180 minutes = 315 minutes
4. **Weekend learning time:** 315 minutes / 9 = 35 minutes
5. **Total weekly learning time:** 315 minutes + 35 minutes = 350 minutes
6. **Total weekly learning time in hours:** 350 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5.83 hours

**1. Calculate Olivia's original speed on the beach:**

* She walks 10 kilometers on the beach in 60 minutes, so her original speed on the beach was 10 km / 60 minutes = 1/6 km per minute.

**2. Calculate Olivia's current speed on the beach:**

* Her speed has decreased by half, so her current speed on the beach is (1/6 km/minute) / 2 = 1/12 km per minute.

**3. Calculate Olivia's original speed on the sidewalk:**

* Her sidewalk speed was four times her beach speed, so her original sidewalk speed was (1/6 km/minute) * 4 = 2/3 km per minute.

**4. Calculate Olivia's current speed on the sidewalk:**

* Her sidewalk speed has also decreased by half, so her current sidewalk speed is (2/3 km/minute) / 2 = 1/3 km per minute.

**5. Calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk:**

* She walks 10 kilometers on the sidewalk at a speed of 1/3 km per minute, so it takes her 10 km / (1/3 km/minute) = 30 minutes.

* Olivia walks four times faster on the sidewalk than on the beach. Let's represent her beach walking speed as 'x'.
* Her sidewalk walking speed is then '4x'.

**2.  Speed Reduction:**

* Her speed on both the beach and sidewalk has decreased by half due to her injury.
* New beach walking speed: x/2
* New sidewalk walking speed: 4x/2 = 2x

**3.  Time on the Beach:**

* We know Olivia spends 60 minutes walking on the beach.

**4.  Distance on the Beach:**

*  Distance = Speed x Time
*  Distance on the beach = (x/2) * 60 = 30x

**5.  Distance on the Sidewalk:**

*  Distance on the sidewalk = 20 km - 30x 

**6.  Time on the Sidewalk:**

*  Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed
*  Time on the sidewalk = (20 km - 30x) / 2x

**7.  Total Time:**

*  Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk
*  Total time = 60 + (20 km - 30x) / 2x

Now, look at this question:
Question: Olivia walks 20 kilometers every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 kilometers of walking on the beach and 10 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?
Your initial answer was: A: Let's think step by step. 

This problem involves several steps and concepts. Here's a breakdown:

**1.  Speed Relationship:**

* Olivia walks four times faster on the sidewalk than on the beach. Let's represent her beach walking speed as 'x'.
* Her sidewalk walking speed is then '4x'.

**2.  Speed Reduction:**

* Her speed on both the beach and sidewalk has decreased by half due to her injury.
* New beach walking speed: x/2
* New sidewalk walking speed: 4x/2 = 2x

**3.  Time on the Beach:**

* We know Olivia spends 60 minutes walking on the beach.

**4.  Distance on the Beach:**

*  Distance = Speed x Time
*  Distance on the beach = (x/2) * 60 = 30x

**5.  Distance on the Sidewalk:**

*  Distance on the sidewalk = 20 km - 30x 

**6.  Time on the Sidewalk:**

*  Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed
*  Time on the sidewalk = (20 km - 30x) / 2x

**7.  Total Time:**

*  Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk
*  Total time = 60 + (20 km - 30x) / 2x

**8.  Finding 'x':**

* To find the total time, we need to find the value of 'x'.  We can use the fact that the total distance is 20 km.
* 30x + (20 km - 30x) = 20 km 
* This equation simplifies, and we can solve for 'x'.

**9.  Calculate Total Time:**

* Once we have the value of 'x', substitute it back into the total time equation to get the final answer in minutes.



Let me know if you'd like me to work through the solution for 'x' and the final calculation of the total time.
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer

My initial attempt at solving this problem was flawed because I got lost in the complexity of the relationships between speed, distance, and time. While I correctly identified the key steps involved, I failed to execute them accurately.  

Specifically, I struggled with:

* **Variable Representation:** I introduced the variable 'x' to represent Olivia's beach walking speed, but I didn't consistently use it throughout the calculations. 
* **Substitution:** I didn't properly substitute the values of speed and distance into the time equations.
* **Simplification:** I didn't simplify the equations effectively, leading to errors in the final calculation.

**Error Keywords:**

- Conceptual Understanding
- Variable Management
- Substitution Error
- Simplification Error
- Calculation Error

## Corrected Solution

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent Olivia's original beach walking speed (km/minute).
* Sidewalk speed: 4x (km/minute)

**2. Calculate New Speeds:**

* Beach speed after injury: x/2 (km/minute)
* Sidewalk speed after injury: 2x (km/minute)

**3.  Distance on the Beach:**

* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance on the beach = (x/2) * 60 = 30x kilometers

**4. Distance on the Sidewalk:**

* Distance on the sidewalk = 20 km - 30x kilometers

**5. Time on the Sidewalk:**

* Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed
* Time on the sidewalk = (20 km - 30x) / 2x minutes

**6. Total Time:**

* Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk
* Total time = 60 + (20 km - 30x) / 2x minutes

**7. Solve for 'x':**

* We know the total distance is 20 km: 30x + (20 km - 30x) = 20 km
* This equation simplifies to 20 km = 20 km, which is always true. This means the value of 'x' doesn't affect the total time.

**8. Calculate Total Time:**

* Since 'x' doesn't affect the total time, we can directly use the total time equation:
* Total time = 60 + (20 km - 30x) / 2x minutes 
*  Since the distance on the beach (30x) and sidewalk (20 km - 30x) always add up to 20 km, the total time will always be 60 minutes.

If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?",75.0,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate Olivia's original speed on the beach:**

* She walks 10 kilometers on the beach in 60 minutes, so her original speed on the beach was 10 km / 60 minutes = 1/6 km per minute.

**2. Calculate Olivia's current speed on the beach:**

* Her speed has decreased by half, so her current speed on the beach is (1/6 km/minute) / 2 = 1/12 km per minute.

**3. Calculate Olivia's original speed on the sidewalk:**

* Her sidewalk speed was four times her beach speed, so her original sidewalk speed was (1/6 km/minute) * 4 = 2/3 km per minute.

**4. Calculate Olivia's current speed on the sidewalk:**

* Her sidewalk speed has also decreased by half, so her current sidewalk speed is (2/3 km/minute) / 2 = 1/3 km per minute.

**5. Calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk:**

* She walks 10 kilometers on the sidewalk at a speed of 1/3 km per minute, so it takes her 10 km / (1/3 km/minute) = 30 minutes.

- **Distance:**  Did not correctly relate distance to time spent on each part of the trail.
- **Time:**  Failed to calculate the time spent on each part of the trail accurately.
- **Rate:**  Misunderstood the relationship between rate and speed.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate Olivia's original speeds:**
    - Let 'x' be Olivia's original speed on the beach.
    - Her original speed on the sidewalk is 4x.

2. **Calculate Olivia's speeds after the injury:**
    - Her new speed on the beach is x/2.
    - Her new speed on the sidewalk is 4x/2 = 2x.

3. **Calculate the time spent on the beach:**
    - Time = Distance / Speed
    - Time on beach = 10 km / (x/2) = 20/x hours

4. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
    - Time on sidewalk = 10 km / (2x) = 5/x hours

5. **Set up an equation:**
    - We know 60 minutes (1 hour) is spent on the beach.
    - Convert 60 minutes to hours: 60/60 = 1 hour
    -  20/x = 1 

6. **Solve for x:**
    - x = 20 km/hour (Olivia's original speed on the beach)

7. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
    - Time on sidewalk = 5/x = 5/20 = 0.25 hours

8. **Convert the time on the sidewalk to minutes:**

p1,gsm-symbolic,google/gemma-2-9b-it,"Olivia walks 20 kilometers every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 kilometers of walking on the beach and 10 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?",75.0,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate Olivia's original speed on the beach:**

* She walks 10 kilometers on the beach in 60 minutes, so her original speed on the beach was 10 km / 60 minutes = 1/6 km per minute.

**2. Calculate Olivia's current speed on the beach:**

* Her speed has decreased by half, so her current speed on the beach is (1/6 km/minute) / 2 = 1/12 km per minute.

**3. Calculate Olivia's original speed on the sidewalk:**

* Her sidewalk speed was four times her beach speed, so her original sidewalk speed was (1/6 km/minute) * 4 = 2/3 km per minute.

**4. Calculate Olivia's current speed on the sidewalk:**

* Her sidewalk speed has also decreased by half, so her current sidewalk speed is (2/3 km/minute) / 2 = 1/3 km per minute.

**5. Calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk:**

* She walks 10 kilometers on the sidewalk at a speed of 1/3 km per minute, so it takes her 10 km / (1/3 km/minute) = 30 minutes.

**6. Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**

* Her total walk time is 60 minutes (beach) + 30 minutes (sidewalk) = 90 minutes.



**Answer:** It takes Olivia 90 minutes to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk.",20.0,0,"A: Let's think step by step. 

This problem involves several steps and concepts. Here's a breakdown:

**1.  Speed Relationship:**

* Olivia walks four times faster on the sidewalk than on the beach. Let's represent her beach walking speed as 'x'.
* Her sidewalk walking speed is then '4x'.

**2.  Speed Reduction:**

* Her speed on both the beach and sidewalk has decreased by half due to her injury.
* New beach walking speed: x/2
* New sidewalk walking speed: 4x/2 = 2x

**3.  Time on the Beach:**

* We know Olivia spends 60 minutes walking on the beach.

**4.  Distance on the Beach:**

*  Distance = Speed x Time
*  Distance on the beach = (x/2) * 60 = 30x

**5.  Distance on the Sidewalk:**

*  Distance on the sidewalk = 20 km - 30x 

**6.  Time on the Sidewalk:**

*  Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed
*  Time on the sidewalk = (20 km - 30x) / 2x

**7.  Total Time:**

*  Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk
*  Total time = 60 + (20 km - 30x) / 2x

**8.  Finding 'x':**

* To find the total time, we need to find the value of 'x'.  We can use the fact that the total distance is 20 km.
* 30x + (20 km - 30x) = 20 km 
* This equation simplifies, and we can solve for 'x'.

**9.  Calculate Total Time:**

* Once we have the value of 'x', substitute it back into the total time equation to get the final answer in minutes.



Let me know if you'd like me to work through the solution for 'x' and the final calculation of the total time.",9.0,0,3.0,0.0,90.0,"--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

**Explanation:** My previous answers were incorrect because I failed to properly account for the change in Olivia's speed due to her injury. I also didn't correctly calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk. 

**Error Keywords:**

- **Speed:** Miscalculated the impact of the speed decrease.
- **Time:** Incorrectly calculated the time spent on each part of the walk.
- **Rate:**  Failed to properly apply the relationship between speed and rate.
- **Proportion:**  Didn't accurately use the given information about the speed difference on the beach and sidewalk.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the speed on the beach before the injury:** Since Olivia walks 10 km on the beach in 60 minutes, her speed before the injury was 10 km / 60 minutes = 1/6 km per minute.

2. **Calculate the speed on the beach after the injury:** Her speed decreased by half, so her new speed on the beach is (1/6 km/minute) / 2 = 1/12 km/minute.

3. **Calculate the speed on the sidewalk before the injury:** Her speed on the sidewalk is four times her speed on the beach, so her speed before the injury was (1/6 km/minute) * 4 = 2/3 km/minute.

4. **Calculate the speed on the sidewalk after the injury:** Her speed on the sidewalk also decreased by half, so her new speed is (2/3 km/minute) / 2 = 1/3 km/minute.

5. **Calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk:**  She walks 10 km on the sidewalk at a speed of 1/3 km/minute, so it takes her 10 km / (1/3 km/minute) = 30 minutes.

6. **Calculate the total time for the walk:**  She spends 60 minutes on the beach and 30 minutes on the sidewalk, for a total of 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Jin caught 7 trouts last Sunday, the first trout he caught weighs 62 kilograms, the second trout he caught weighs 31 kilograms, and each of the rest trout he caught weighs 16 kilograms more than the second one. If a kilogram of trout costs $2.25, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?
Your initial answer was: A: Let's think step by step...

1. **Calculate the weight of the remaining trouts:**
   - The second trout weighs 31 kilograms.
   - Each of the rest weighs 16 kilograms more, so they weigh 31 + 16 = 47 kilograms each.
   - Jin caught 7 - 2 = 5 more trouts.
   - The total weight of the remaining trouts is 5 * 47 = 235 kilograms.

2. **Calculate the total weight of all the trouts:**
   - The total weight is 62 + 31 + 235 = 328 kilograms.

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Each kilogram of trout costs $2.25.
   - Jin will earn 328 * 2.25 = $744.

**The answer is $744.**
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer

My previous answer was incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the weight of the remaining trouts. I incorrectly added 16 kilograms to the weight of the second trout to find the weight of the remaining trouts, instead of recognizing that each of the remaining trouts weighed 16 kilograms *more* than the second trout. 

**Error Keywords:**

- Calculation error
- Misinterpretation of word problem
- Arithmetic error
- Incorrect application of addition

## Corrected Solution

1. **Calculate the weight of the remaining trouts:**
   - The second trout weighs 31 kilograms.
   - Each of the remaining trouts weighs 31 + 16 = 47 kilograms.
   - Jin caught 7 - 2 = 5 more trouts.
   - The total weight of the remaining trouts is 5 * 47 = 235 kilograms.

2. **Calculate the total weight of all the trouts:**
   - The total weight is 62 + 31 + 235 = 328 kilograms.

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Each kilogram of trout costs $2.25.
   - Jin will earn 328 * 2.25 = $744.

**The answer is $744.**

Now, look at this question:
Question: To make a call from a phone booth, you must pay ¥0.7 for each minute of your call. After 10 minutes, that price drops to ¥0.5 per minute. After 34 minutes from the start of the call, the price drops even more to ¥0.1 per two minutes. How much would a 94-minute call cost?
Your initial answer was: Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the cost of the first 20 minutes:**

* The cost per minute for the first 20 minutes is ¥0.70.
* Total cost for the first 20 minutes: 20 minutes * ¥0.70/minute = ¥14.00

**2. Calculate the cost of the remaining minutes:**

* The cost per minute after 20 minutes is ¥0.50.
* The call lasted for 34 minutes total, so there are 34 minutes - 20 minutes = 14 minutes remaining.
* Total cost for the remaining minutes: 14 minutes * ¥0.50/minute = ¥7.00

**3. Calculate the total cost of the call:**

* Total cost: ¥14.00 (first 20 minutes) + ¥7.00 (remaining minutes) = ¥21.00

**4. Calculate the cost of the phone booth call:**

* The phone booth call cost ¥0.70 per minute for the first 20 minutes.
* The cost of the phone booth call is ¥0.70 * 20 minutes = ¥14.00.

**5. Calculate the total cost of the call:**

* Total cost: ¥14.00 (phone booth call) + ¥7.00 (remaining minutes) = ¥21.00



**Therefore, the total cost of the call is ¥21.00.**
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answer was incorrect because I failed to account for the price change after 34 minutes. I only calculated the cost for the first 20 minutes and the subsequent period until 34 minutes, neglecting the final price reduction and the remaining minutes. 

**Error Keywords:**

- **Logical Error:**  I didn't follow the problem's conditions correctly.
- **Incomplete Calculation:** I missed a significant portion of the calculation.
- **Price Change Misunderstanding:** I didn't properly apply the price change after 34 minutes.

## Corrected Solution:

**1. Cost of the first 10 minutes:**

* ¥0.70/minute * 10 minutes = ¥7.00

**2. Cost of minutes 10-34:**

* ¥0.50/minute * 24 minutes = ¥12.00

**3. Cost of minutes 34-94:**

* ¥0.10/2 minutes * 30 sets of 2 minutes = ¥3.00

**4. Total Cost:**

* ¥7.00 + ¥12.00 + ¥3.00 = ¥22.00



## Instructions for Future Success:

1. **Read Carefully:**  Thoroughly understand the problem and all its conditions, including price changes and time intervals.
2. **Break Down:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
3. **Identify Price Changes:**  Clearly mark the time points where prices change.

**Explanation:** My previous answers were incorrect because I failed to properly segment the call duration based on the changing rates and calculate the cost for each segment separately. I likely made a simple arithmetic error or didn't account for the different pricing tiers.

**Error Keywords:**

- Calculation
- Segmentation
- Rate Changes
- Time Intervals

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Segment 1 (0-10 minutes):**
   - Cost = 10 minutes * ¥0.7/minute = ¥7.00

2. **Segment 2 (10-34 minutes):**
   - Duration = 34 minutes - 10 minutes = 24 minutes
   - Cost = 24 minutes * ¥0.5/minute = ¥12.00

3. **Segment 3 (34-94 minutes):**
   - Duration = 94 minutes - 34 minutes = 60 minutes
   - Number of 2-minute intervals = 60 minutes / 2 minutes/interval = 30 intervals
   - Cost = 30 intervals * ¥0.1/interval = ¥3.00

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost = ¥7.00 + ¥12.00 + ¥3.00 = **¥22.00**


## Instructions for Future Problems:

1. **Identify Rate Changes:** Carefully read the problem to pinpoint the time intervals when the rate changes.

My previous answer of ""None"" was completely incorrect. I failed to carefully read and understand the problem. I got stuck on the initial drop and didn't process the subsequent steps where Gabriel found some beads, discarded some, and received more from his father. 

**Error Keywords:**

* **Word problem interpretation:** I didn't grasp the full sequence of events.
* **Subtraction:** I didn't correctly apply subtraction to calculate the beads lost.
* **Addition:** I missed adding the beads found, the beads received, and the remaining beads.

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Calculate beads dropped:** 78 beads * (1/3) = 26 beads dropped.
2. **Calculate remaining beads after drop:** 78 beads - 26 beads = 52 beads.
3. **Calculate beads remaining after finding some:** 52 beads - 17 beads = 35 beads.
4. **Calculate beads remaining after discarding some:** 35 beads - 9 beads = 26 beads.
5. **Calculate total beads:** 26 beads + 7 beads = 33 beads.


## Instructions for Future Problems:

1. **Read carefully:**  Read the entire problem multiple times to ensure understanding of all steps and information.
2. **Identify key information:** Highlight or underline important numbers, quantities, and actions.
3. **Break down the problem:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
4. **Use variables (optional):** Assign variables to unknown quantities to make calculations clearer.
5. **Write out steps:**  Write down each step of the solution process to avoid losing track.
6. **Check units:** Ensure units are consistent throughout the calculation.
7. **Double-check:** Review the solution for accuracy and logical flow.

## General Advice:

* **Practice regularly:**  Solving word problems is a skill that improves with practice.
* **Look for patterns:**  Identify common problem types and develop strategies for solving them.
* **Don't be afraid to ask for help:** If you're stuck, seek assistance from a teacher, tutor, or peer.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer

My previous answer was incorrect because I failed to consider the weight of the car itself when calculating the total weight. I only added the weight of the luggage, children, and spare tires to the car's base weight. This led to an inaccurate calculation of the force needed to move the car.

**Error Keywords:**

- Conceptual error
- Misunderstanding of problem context
- Incomplete information processing

## Corrected Solution

1. **Identify the total weight:** 
   - Car weight: 1350 pounds
   - Luggage weight: 450 pounds
   - Children's weight: 4 children * 65 pounds/child = 260 pounds
   - Spare tires weight: 2 tires * 70 pounds/tire = 140 pounds
   - Total weight: 1350 + 450 + 260 + 140 = 2100 pounds

2. **Calculate the force needed:**
   - Force = 2% of total weight
   - Force = 0.02 * 2100 pounds = 42 pounds

**Therefore, Esteban needs to push with a force of 42 pounds.**

## Instructions for Future Success

Now, look at this question:
Question: Esteban's car breaks down. The car weighs 1350 pounds and he has luggage in it weighing 450 pounds. He also has his 4 young children who weigh 65 pounds each in it. In addition, the car comes with two spare tires, each weighing 70 pounds. If the force need to move the car is 2% of the total weight, how much force does Esteban need to push the car?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 42.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answer of 42.0 was incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the total weight of the car and its contents. I likely missed adding up the weight of the children and spare tires. 

**Error Keywords:**

- Calculation
- Total weight
- Addition

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the children:** 4 children * 65 pounds/child = 260 pounds
2. **Calculate the total weight of the spare tires:** 2 tires * 70 pounds/tire = 140 pounds
3. **Calculate the total weight of the car and its contents:** 1350 pounds (car) + 450 pounds (luggage) + 260 pounds (children) + 140 pounds (tires) = 2200 pounds
4. **Calculate the force needed:** 2200 pounds * 0.02 (2%) = 44 pounds

**Therefore, Esteban needs to push with 44 pounds of force.**


## Instructions for Future Problems:

1. **Identify all components contributing to the total weight.**
2. **Calculate the weight of each component individually.**
3. **Add up the weights of all components to find the total weight.**
4. **Apply the given percentage to the total weight to determine the required force.**
5. **Double-check all calculations for accuracy.**

## General Advice:

- **Read the problem carefully and identify all relevant information.**
- **Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.**
- **Use clear and organized notation to avoid confusion.**
- **Always double-check your work for accuracy.**
- **Practice solving similar problems to improve your understanding and skills.**","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---
