p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Sophia went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, and 60 mini cheesecakes. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,"To solve this problem, we will calculate the cost of each type of pastry and determine the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the donuts
Sophia bought **60 donuts**, and the price is **$19 per dozen**. Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, the number of dozens of donuts she bought is:

\[
\text{Dozens of donuts} = \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ dozens}.
\]

The total cost of the donuts is:

\[
\text{Cost of donuts} = 5 \times 19 = 95 \text{ dollars}.
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes
Sophia bought **60 mini cupcakes**, and the price is **$33 per dozen**. Since there are 12 mini cupcakes in a dozen, the number of dozens of mini cupcakes she bought is:

\[
\text{Dozens of mini cupcakes} = \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ dozens}.
\]

The total cost of the mini cupcakes is:

\[
\text{Cost of mini cupcakes} = 5 \times 33 = 165 \text{ dollars}.
\]

---

### Step 3: Let the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen be \( x \)
Sophia also bought **60 mini cheesecakes**. Since there are 12 mini cheesecakes in a dozen, the number of dozens of mini cheesecakes she bought is:

\[
\text{Dozens of mini cheesecakes} = \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ dozens}.
\]

Let the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen be \( x \). Then, the total cost of the mini cheesecakes is:

\[
\text{Cost of mini cheesecakes} = 5 \times x = 5x \text{ dollars}.
\]

---

### Step 4: Write the total cost equation before the discount
The total cost of all the pastries before the discount is the sum of the costs of the donuts, mini cupcakes, and mini cheesecakes:

\[
\text{Total cost before discount} = 95 + 165 + 5x.
\]

Simplify:

\[
\text{Total cost before discount} = 260 + 5x.
\]

---

### Step 5: Apply the 20% discount
Sophia received a **20% discount**, so she paid only **80% of the total cost**. The total amount she paid after the discount is $1500. Therefore, we can write:

\[
0.8 \times (260 + 5x) = 1500.
\]

---

### Step 6: Solve for \( x \)
Divide both sides of the equation by 0.8 to eliminate the discount factor:

\[
260 + 5x = \frac{1500}{0.8}.
\]

Simplify the right-hand side:

\[
260 + 5x = 1875.
\]

Subtract 260 from both sides:

\[
5x = 1875 - 260.
\]

Simplify:

\[
5x = 1615.
\]

Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{1615}{5}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
x = 323.
\]

---

### Step 7: Interpret the result
The cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is **$323**.

---

### Final Answer:
The cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is **$323**.",323.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Sophia bought three types of pastries: donuts, mini cupcakes, and mini cheesecakes. We need to calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the donuts.
Sophia bought 60 donuts. A dozen (12) donuts costs $19.  
The number of dozens of donuts is:
\[
\text{Dozens of donuts} = \frac{60}{12} = 5
\]
The total cost of the donuts is:
\[
\text{Cost of donuts} = 5 \times 19 = 95 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes.
Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes. A dozen (12) mini cupcakes costs $33.  
The number of dozens of mini cupcakes is:
\[
\text{Dozens of mini cupcakes} = \frac{60}{12} = 5
\]
The total cost of the mini cupcakes is:
\[
\text{Cost of mini cupcakes} = 5 \times 33 = 165 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

### Step 3: Let the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen be \( x \).
Sophia bought 60 mini cheesecakes. The number of dozens of mini cheesecakes is:
\[
\text{Dozens of mini cheesecakes} = \frac{60}{12} = 5
\]
The total cost of the mini cheesecakes is:
\[
\text{Cost of mini cheesecakes} = 5 \times x = 5x.
\]

### Step 4: Write the total cost before the discount.
The total cost of all the pastries before the discount is:
\[
\text{Total cost before discount} = \text{Cost of donuts} + \text{Cost of mini cupcakes} + \text{Cost of mini cheesecakes}.
\]
Substitute the values we know:
\[
\text{Total cost before discount} = 95 + 165 + 5x = 260 + 5x.
\]

### Step 5: Apply the 20% discount.
After a 20% discount, Sophia paid $1500. The total cost after the discount is:
\[
\text{Total cost after discount} = \text{Total cost before discount} \times (1 - 0.20).
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
1500 = (260 + 5x) \times 0.8.
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( x \).
Divide both sides by 0.8 to eliminate the discount factor:
\[
\frac{1500}{0.8} = 260 + 5x.
\]
\[
1875 = 260 + 5x.
\]
Subtract 260 from both sides:
\[
1875 - 260 = 5x.
\]
\[
1615 = 5x.
\]
Divide both sides by 5:
\[
x = \frac{1615}{5} = 323.
\]

### Step 7: Interpret the result.
The cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is:

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving. A 300 grams bag has 6 servings. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?",350.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many grams of popcorn Hiroshi and Tara can consume based on their respective calorie targets and current calorie consumption. Then, we will find the difference in the amount of popcorn they can consume.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the daily calorie target for Hiroshi and Tara
The daily calorie target is **15 calories per pound of body weight**.

- **Hiroshi's daily calorie target**:
  \[
  15 \times 220 = 3300 \, \text{calories}
  \]

- **Tara's daily calorie target**:
  \[
  15 \times 140 = 2100 \, \text{calories}
  \]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining calories Hiroshi and Tara can consume
We subtract the calories they have already consumed from their daily targets. Note that Hiroshi burned 200 calories through exercise, so we subtract that from his total calorie consumption.

- **Hiroshi's remaining calories**:
  \[
  3300 - (1100 - 200) = 3300 - 900 = 2400 \, \text{calories}
  \]

- **Tara's remaining calories**:
  Tara consumed 900 calories in food and 200 calories in ice cream, so:
  \[
  2100 - (900 + 200) = 2100 - 1100 = 1000 \, \text{calories}
  \]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the calories per gram of popcorn
The bag of popcorn has **200 calories per serving**, and the bag contains **6 servings**. The total weight of the bag is **300 grams**.

- Total calories in the bag:
  \[
  200 \times 6 = 1200 \, \text{calories}
  \]

- Calories per gram of popcorn:
  \[
  \frac{1200}{300} = 4 \, \text{calories per gram}
  \]

---

### Step 4: Calculate how many grams of popcorn Hiroshi and Tara can consume
We divide their remaining calorie allowances by the calories per gram of popcorn.

- **Hiroshi's popcorn consumption**:
  \[
  \frac{2400}{4} = 600 \, \text{grams}
  \]

- **Tara's popcorn consumption**:
  \[
  \frac{1000}{4} = 250 \, \text{grams}
  \]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the difference in popcorn consumption
The difference in the amount of popcorn Hiroshi can consume compared to Tara is:
\[
600 - 250 = 350 \, \text{grams}
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Hiroshi can consume **350 grams more popcorn** than Tara.",350.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the daily calorie target for Hiroshi and Tara.
- Hiroshi's weight is 220 lbs. The daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight.
  So, Hiroshi's daily calorie target is:
  \[
  220 \times 15 = 3300 \, \text{calories}.
  \]

- Tara's weight is 140 lbs. The daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight.
  So, Tara's daily calorie target is:
  \[
  140 \times 15 = 2100 \, \text{calories}.
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining calories Hiroshi and Tara can consume.
- Hiroshi has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. This means his net calorie consumption so far is:
  \[
  1100 - 200 = 900 \, \text{calories}.
  \]
  The remaining calories Hiroshi can consume are:
  \[
  3300 - 900 = 2400 \, \text{calories}.
  \]

- Tara has consumed 900 calories in food and 200 calories in ice cream. Her total calorie consumption so far is:
  \[
  900 + 200 = 1100 \, \text{calories}.
  \]
  The remaining calories Tara can consume are:
  \[
  2100 - 1100 = 1000 \, \text{calories}.
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the calories in 1 gram of popcorn.
The bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving, and the bag contains 6 servings. The total calories in the bag are:
\[
200 \times 6 = 1200 \, \text{calories}.
\]
The bag weighs 300 grams, so the calories per gram of popcorn are:
\[
\frac{1200}{300} = 4 \, \text{calories per gram}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate how many grams of popcorn Hiroshi and Tara can consume.
- Hiroshi can consume 2400 calories. Since each gram of popcorn has 4 calories, the number of grams of popcorn Hiroshi can consume is:
  \[
  \frac{2400}{4} = 600 \, \text{grams}.
  \]

- Tara can consume 1000 calories. Since each gram of popcorn has 4 calories, the number of grams of popcorn Tara can consume is:
  \[
  \frac{1000}{4} = 250 \, \text{grams}.
  \]

### Step 5: Calculate how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi can consume than Tara.
The difference in the amount of popcorn Hiroshi can consume compared to Tara is:
\[
600 - 250 = 350 \, \text{grams}.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 60 minutes to cover every 4 miles of the city. However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how long it will take for the fog bank to cover \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the city, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \) miles. Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the fog's initial speed
We are told that the fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes. Therefore, the fog's initial speed is:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{4 \, \text{miles}}{60 \, \text{minutes}} = \frac{1}{15} \, \text{miles per minute}.
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to cover 20 miles at the initial speed
If the fog bank maintained its initial speed of \( \frac{1}{15} \, \text{miles per minute} \), the time to cover 20 miles would be:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{20 \, \text{miles}}{\frac{1}{15} \, \text{miles per minute}} = 20 \times 15 = 300 \, \text{minutes}.
\]

However, the wind speed is halved after 1 hour (60 minutes), so the fog's speed will also be halved after 60 minutes. This means the fog will not maintain a constant speed for the entire 20 miles. We need to account for the change in speed.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the distance covered in the first 60 minutes
In the first 60 minutes, the fog moves at its initial speed of \( \frac{1}{15} \, \text{miles per minute} \). The distance covered in 60 minutes is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = \frac{1}{15} \, \text{miles per minute} \times 60 \, \text{minutes} = 4 \, \text{miles}.
\]

So, after 60 minutes, the fog has covered 4 miles, leaving \( 20 - 4 = 16 \, \text{miles} \) still to be covered.

---

### Step 4: Determine the fog's new speed after 60 minutes
After 60 minutes, the wind speed is halved, so the fog's speed is also halved. The new speed is:

\[
\text{New Speed} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{15} = \frac{1}{30} \, \text{miles per minute}.
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the time to cover the remaining 16 miles at the new speed
At the new speed of \( \frac{1}{30} \, \text{miles per minute} \), the time to cover the remaining 16 miles is:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{16 \, \text{miles}}{\frac{1}{30} \, \text{miles per minute}} = 16 \times 30 = 480 \, \text{minutes}.
\]

---

### Step 6: Calculate the total time to cover 20 miles
The total time to cover 20 miles is the sum of the time for the first 4 miles and the time for the remaining 16 miles:

\[
\text{Total Time} = 60 \, \text{minutes} + 480 \, \text{minutes} = 540 \, \text{minutes}.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
It will take **540 minutes** for the fog bank to cover \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the city.",4.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

The city is 80 miles across, and we are tasked with finding how long it will take for the fog bank to cover **1/4 of the city**.

1. First, calculate the distance that is 1/4 of the city:
   \[
   \text{1/4 of the city} = \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \, \text{miles}.
   \]

2. The fog bank takes **60 minutes to cover 4 miles**. This means the fog bank's speed is:
   \[
   \text{Speed of the fog bank} = \frac{4 \, \text{miles}}{60 \, \text{minutes}} = \frac{1 \, \text{mile}}{15 \, \text{minutes}}.
   \]

3. To cover 20 miles at this speed, the time required is:
   \[
   \text{Time to cover 20 miles} = 20 \times 15 = 300 \, \text{minutes}.
   \]

4. However, the problem states that the **wind speed will be halved in one hour (60 minutes)**. This means the fog bank's speed will decrease after the first hour. We need to account for this change in speed.

   - In the first 60 minutes, the fog bank will cover:
     \[
     \text{Distance covered in 60 minutes} = \frac{1 \, \text{mile}}{15 \, \text{minutes}} \times 60 \, \text{minutes} = 4 \, \text{miles}.
     \]

   - After 60 minutes, the fog bank's speed is halved. The new speed is:
     \[
     \text{New speed} = \frac{1 \, \text{mile}}{15 \, \text{minutes}} \div 2 = \frac{1 \, \text{mile}}{30 \, \text{minutes}}.
     \]

5. The remaining distance to cover after the first hour is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \, \text{miles} - 4 \, \text{miles} = 16 \, \text{miles}.
   \]

6. At the new speed of \(\frac{1 \, \text{mile}}{30 \, \text{minutes}}\), the time required to cover the remaining 16 miles is:
   \[
   \text{Time to cover 16 miles} = 16 \times 30 = 480 \, \text{minutes}.
   \]

7. Adding the time for the first 4 miles (60 minutes) to the time for the remaining 16 miles (480 minutes), the total time to cover 20 miles is:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 60 + 480 = 540 \, \text{minutes}.

On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 2-hour episodes. On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?",6.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Santiago spent watching TV on each day and determine how many 15-minute episodes he watched on Thursday.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total time Santiago spent watching TV on each day.

#### **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
Santiago watched 4-hour episodes each night. Since he watched on both Tuesday and Wednesday:
\[
4 \, \text{hours} + 4 \, \text{hours} = 8 \, \text{hours}.
\]

#### **Thursday:**
On Thursday, Santiago watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. Let the number of episodes he watched on Thursday be \( x \). Since each episode is 15 minutes, the total time he spent watching TV on Thursday is:
\[
\frac{15x}{60} = 0.25x \, \text{hours}.
\]

#### **Friday:**
On Friday, Santiago watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. Converting 45 minutes to hours:
\[
\frac{45}{60} = 0.75 \, \text{hours}.
\]
The total time he spent watching TV on Friday is:
\[
3 \, \text{hours} + 0.75 \, \text{hours} = 3.75 \, \text{hours}.
\]

#### **Saturday:**
On Saturday, Santiago watched three 2-hour episodes. The total time he spent watching TV on Saturday is:
\[
3 \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{hours}.
\]

#### **Sunday:**
On Sunday, Santiago watched three 15-minute episodes. Converting 15 minutes to hours:
\[
\frac{15}{60} = 0.25 \, \text{hours}.
\]
The total time he spent watching TV on Sunday is:
\[
3 \times 0.25 \, \text{hours} = 0.75 \, \text{hours}.
\]

---

### Step 2: Write an equation for the total time spent watching TV.
The total time Santiago spent watching TV over the week is given as 20 hours. Adding up the times for each day:
\[
8 \, \text{hours (Tuesday and Wednesday)} + 0.25x \, \text{hours (Thursday)} + 3.75 \, \text{hours (Friday)} + 6 \, \text{hours (Saturday)} + 0.75 \, \text{hours (Sunday)} = 20 \, \text{hours}.
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
18.5 + 0.25x = 20.
\]

---

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \).
Subtract 18.5 from both sides:
\[
0.25x = 1.5.
\]

Divide both sides by 0.25:
\[
x = \frac{1.5}{0.25} = 6.
\]

---

### Step 4: Verify the solution.
If \( x = 6 \), then Santiago watched 6 episodes of the 15-minute show on Thursday. The total time spent watching TV on Thursday is:
\[
6 \times 0.25 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours}.
\]

Adding up the total time for all days:
\[
8 \, \text{hours (Tuesday and Wednesday)} + 1.5 \, \text{hours (Thursday)} + 3.75 \, \text{hours (Friday)} + 6 \, \text{hours (Saturday)} + 0.75 \, \text{hours (Sunday)} = 20 \, \text{hours}.
\]

The total matches the given 20 hours, so the solution is correct.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Nia makes tea using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 54:27. She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, and uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,"We are tasked with finding how many teaspoons of sugar Nia used, given the ratios and total quantities of ingredients. Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define variables
Let:
- \( x \) = number of **teaspoons of sugar**,
- \( y \) = number of **cups of water**,
- \( z \) = number of **tablespoons of milk**,
- \( w \) = number of **tablespoons of heavy cream**.

We are given that the total of all these quantities is 240:
\[
x + y + z + w = 240.
\]

---

### Step 2: Use the sugar-to-water ratio
The ratio of sugar to water is \( 54:27 \), which simplifies to \( 2:1 \). This means:
\[
x = 2y.
\]

---

### Step 3: Use the milk-to-water ratio
Nia uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, which simplifies to \( 1:1 \). This means:
\[
z = y.
\]

---

### Step 4: Use the cream-to-sugar ratio
Nia uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar, which means:
\[
w = 2x.
\]

---

### Step 5: Substitute relationships into the total equation
Substitute \( x = 2y \), \( z = y \), and \( w = 2x \) into the total equation \( x + y + z + w = 240 \):
\[
x + y + z + w = 240,
\]
\[
(2y) + y + y + 2(2y) = 240.
\]

Simplify:
\[
2y + y + y + 4y = 240,
\]
\[
8y = 240.
\]

---

### Step 6: Solve for \( y \)
\[
y = \frac{240}{8} = 30.
\]

---

### Step 7: Solve for \( x \), \( z \), and \( w \)
Now that \( y = 30 \), we can find the other variables:
- \( x = 2y = 2(30) = 60 \),
- \( z = y = 30 \),
- \( w = 2x = 2(60) = 120 \).

---

### Step 8: Verify the total
Check that the total is 240:
\[
x + y + z + w = 60 + 30 + 30 + 120 = 240.
\]
The total is correct.

---

### Final Answer:
Nia used **60 teaspoons of sugar**.",60.0,1,"We are tasked with finding how many teaspoons of sugar Nia used, given the ratios and the total number of items used. Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the problem
Nia uses:
- **Teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 54:27.**
  This simplifies to **2:1** (divide both numbers by 27).
  So, for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 1 cup of water.

- **8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water.**
  This simplifies to **1:1** (divide both numbers by 8).
  So, for every 1 cup of water, she uses 1 tablespoon of milk.

- **2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar.**
  So, for every 1 teaspoon of sugar, she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream.

Finally, the total number of items used (teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk) is **240**.

### Step 2: Define variables
Let:
- \( x \) = the number of teaspoons of sugar used.
- From the sugar-to-water ratio (2:1), the number of cups of water used is \( \frac{x}{2} \).
- From the water-to-milk ratio (1:1), the number of tablespoons of milk used is also \( \frac{x}{2} \).
- From the sugar-to-cream ratio (1:2), the number of tablespoons of heavy cream used is \( 2x \).

### Step 3: Write the total equation
The total number of items used is the sum of:
- Teaspoons of sugar: \( x \),
- Cups of water: \( \frac{x}{2} \),
- Tablespoons of milk: \( \frac{x}{2} \),
- Tablespoons of heavy cream: \( 2x \).

So, the total is:
\[
x + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = 240
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the equation
Combine like terms:
\[
x + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = x + x + 2x = 4x
\]

So, the equation becomes:
\[
4x = 240
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
Divide both sides by 4:
\[
x = \frac{240}{4} = 60
\]

### Step 6: Verify the solution
If \( x = 60 \) (teaspoons of sugar):
- Cups of water = \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \),
- Tablespoons of milk = \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \),
- Tablespoons of heavy cream = \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \).

The total is:
\[
60 + 30 + 30 + 120 = 240
\]
This matches the total given in the problem.

The number of teaspoons of sugar Nia used is **60**.",60.0,1,1,,,,0,1,60.0,,,
p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Aisha was preparing for a lunch party at her house, where she intended to serve stuffed peppers. She noticed that she was out of plastic forks, so she bought a new package of forks. Later, her husband also bought a package of 8 new forks and gave them to Aisha. While Aisha was making the stuffed peppers, she used sixteen of the forks to sample her stuffed peppers, then threw away 6 defective forks. The guests also brought 2 packs of forks, each having 6 inside them. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 32 forks. How many forks were in the package that Aisha bought?",34.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many forks were in the package that Aisha bought. Let's break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the unknown
Let \( x \) represent the number of forks in the package that Aisha bought.

---

### Step 2: Account for all the forks
- Aisha bought \( x \) forks.
- Her husband bought a package of 8 forks.
- The guests brought 2 packs of forks, each containing 6 forks, so the total from the guests is:
  \[
  2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ forks.}
  \]

Thus, the total number of forks initially brought into the house is:
\[
x + 8 + 12.
\]

---

### Step 3: Subtract the used and defective forks
- Aisha used 16 forks to sample her stuffed peppers.
- She also threw away 6 defective forks.

The total number of forks removed is:
\[
16 + 6 = 22 \text{ forks.}
\]

After removing these forks, the remaining number of forks is:
\[
x + 8 + 12 - 22.
\]

---

### Step 4: Use the final count of forks
We are told that Aisha had 32 forks left when she went to set the table. Therefore, the remaining number of forks is equal to 32:
\[
x + 8 + 12 - 22 = 32.
\]

---

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
Simplify the equation:
\[
x + 20 - 22 = 32.
\]
\[
x - 2 = 32.

### Final Answer:
The package that Aisha bought contained **34 forks**.",34.0,1,"Aisha bought a package of forks, but we don't know how many were in it. Let's call the number of forks in the package Aisha bought **x**.

Now, let's go step by step:

1. Aisha bought **x** forks.
2. Her husband bought a package of **8 forks** and gave them to her. So now she has **x + 8** forks.
3. Aisha used **16 forks** to sample her stuffed peppers. After using them, the number of forks left is **(x + 8 - 16)**.
4. Aisha threw away **6 defective forks**. After throwing them away, the number of forks left is **(x + 8 - 16 - 6)**.
5. The guests brought **2 packs of forks**, each containing **6 forks**. This adds **2 × 6 = 12 forks** to her collection. Now the total number of forks is **(x + 8 - 16 - 6 + 12)**.
6. Finally, Aisha had a total of **32 forks** when she went to set the table. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 8 - 16 - 6 + 12 = 32
   \]

Now, let's simplify the equation step by step:

\[
x + 8 - 16 - 6 + 12 = 32

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field. There are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard. Ravi can harvest his bananas every 4 months. In addition, Ravi owns a 13-square yard apricot field that produces 12 apricots per square yard. The apricots can be harvested every 4 months. In the span of two years, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?",1764.0,"To solve this problem, we will calculate the total number of bananas and apricots Ravi harvests in two years and then find the difference between the two.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of bananas harvested in two years.

1. **Determine the number of bananas per square yard:**
   Ravi's banana field produces 36 bananas per \( \frac{4}{5} \) of a square yard. To find the number of bananas per square yard, divide 36 by \( \frac{4}{5} \):
   \[
   \text{Bananas per square yard} = \frac{36}{\frac{4}{5}} = 36 \times \frac{5}{4} = 45 \text{ bananas per square yard.}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of bananas per harvest:**
   Ravi's banana field is 10 square yards, and each square yard produces 45 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas per harvest is:
   \[
   \text{Bananas per harvest} = 10 \times 45 = 450 \text{ bananas.}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of harvests in two years:**
   Ravi can harvest bananas every 4 months. There are 12 months in a year, so in two years, there are:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ months.}
   \]
   The number of harvests in 24 months is:
   \[
   \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ harvests.}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of bananas harvested in two years:**
   Multiply the number of bananas per harvest by the number of harvests:
   \[
   \text{Total bananas} = 450 \times 6 = 2700 \text{ bananas.}
   \]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of apricots harvested in two years.

1. **Determine the number of apricots per harvest:**
   Ravi's apricot field is 13 square yards, and each square yard produces 12 apricots. Therefore, the total number of apricots per harvest is:
   \[
   \text{Apricots per harvest} = 13 \times 12 = 156 \text{ apricots.}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of harvests in two years:**
   Like the bananas, apricots can also be harvested every 4 months. Thus, the number of harvests in two years is:
   \[
   \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ harvests.}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of apricots harvested in two years:**
   Multiply the number of apricots per harvest by the number of harvests:
   \[
   \text{Total apricots} = 156 \times 6 = 936 \text{ apricots.}
   \]

---

### Step 3: Find the difference between the total number of bananas and apricots.

1. **Subtract the total number of apricots from the total number of bananas:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 2700 - 936 = 1764.
   \]

---

### Final Answer:
Ravi harvests **1,764 more bananas than apricots** in two years.",1764.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the problem.
Ravi has two fields:
1. A **banana field** of 10 square yards, where there are 36 bananas per four-fifths (4/5) of a square yard. Bananas can be harvested every 4 months.
2. An **apricot field** of 13 square yards, where there are 12 apricots per square yard. Apricots can also be harvested every 4 months.

We are tasked to find how many **more bananas** Ravi harvests than apricots in **two years**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of harvests in two years.
- Two years = 24 months.
- Since both bananas and apricots can be harvested every 4 months:
  \[
  \text{Number of harvests in 2 years} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ harvests}.
  \]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of bananas harvested in one harvest.
- There are **36 bananas per 4/5 of a square yard**.
- To find the number of bananas per square yard:
  \[
  \text{Bananas per square yard} = \frac{36}{4/5} = 36 \times \frac{5}{4} = 45 \text{ bananas per square yard}.
  \]
- Ravi's banana field is **10 square yards**, so the total number of bananas in one harvest is:
  \[
  \text{Bananas in one harvest} = 45 \times 10 = 450 \text{ bananas}.
  \]
- Over 6 harvests, the total number of bananas harvested is:
  \[
  \text{Total bananas in 2 years} = 450 \times 6 = 2700 \text{ bananas}.
  \]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of apricots harvested in one harvest.
- There are **12 apricots per square yard**.
- Ravi's apricot field is **13 square yards**, so the total number of apricots in one harvest is:
  \[
  \text{Apricots in one harvest} = 12 \times 13 = 156 \text{ apricots}.
  \]
- Over 6 harvests, the total number of apricots harvested is:
  \[
  \text{Total apricots in 2 years} = 156 \times 6 = 936 \text{ apricots}.
  \]

---

### Step 5: Find how many more bananas Ravi harvests than apricots.
- The total number of bananas harvested is **2700**.
- The total number of apricots harvested is **936**.
- The difference is:
  \[
  \text{Difference} = 2700 - 936 = 1764.

He also bought 7 pencils which cost $8 each. Arjun can either pay a one-time $20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases, or not become a member and receive only a 5% discount. What is the least amount Arjun can spend on everything?",212.0,"To determine the least amount Arjun can spend, we need to calculate the total cost of his purchases under both scenarios: (1) becoming a member and receiving a 20% discount, and (2) not becoming a member and receiving a 5% discount. We'll compare the two totals and choose the smaller amount.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of items before any discounts
Arjun bought:
- **12 folders** at $4.75 each:  
  \[
  12 \times 4.75 = 57
  \]
- **8 erasers** at $14.50 each:  
  \[
  8 \times 14.50 = 116
  \]
- **1 ream of bond paper** at $11:  
  \[
  11
  \]
- **7 pencils** at $8 each:  
  \[
  7 \times 8 = 56
  \]

The total cost before any discounts is:
\[
57 + 116 + 11 + 56 = 240
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost if Arjun becomes a member
If Arjun becomes a member, he pays a one-time $20 membership fee and gets a 20% discount on all purchases.

1. **Apply the 20% discount to the total cost of $240**:  
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 240 = 0.20 \times 240 = 48
   \]
   The discounted cost is:
   \[
   240 - 48 = 192
   \]

2. **Add the $20 membership fee**:  
   \[
   192 + 20 = 212
   \]

The total cost if Arjun becomes a member is **$212**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost if Arjun does not become a member
If Arjun does not become a member, he receives a 5% discount on all purchases.

1. **Apply the 5% discount to the total cost of $240**:  
   \[
   5\% \text{ of } 240 = 0.05 \times 240 = 12
   \]
   The discounted cost is:
   \[
   240 - 12 = 228

The total cost if Arjun does not become a member is **$228**.

---

### Step 4: Compare the two totals
- Total cost if Arjun becomes a member: **$212**
- Total cost if Arjun does not become a member: **$228**

The least amount Arjun can spend is **$212**, which occurs if he becomes a member.

---

### Final Answer:
The least amount Arjun can spend is **$212**.",212.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of each item before any discounts.
- Arjun bought **12 folders** at $4.75 each.  
  Total cost for folders = \( 12 \times 4.75 = 57 \) dollars.

- Arjun bought **8 erasers** at $14.50 each.  
  Total cost for erasers = \( 8 \times 14.5 = 116 \) dollars.

- Arjun bought **1 ream of bond paper** at $11.  
  Total cost for bond paper = \( 11 \) dollars.

- Arjun bought **7 pencils** at $8 each.  
  Total cost for pencils = \( 7 \times 8 = 56 \) dollars.

### Step 2: Add up the total cost of all items before any discounts.
Total cost = \( 57 + 116 + 11 + 56 = 240 \) dollars.

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost with the two discount options.

#### Option 1: Become a member (pay $20 fee and get a 20% discount).
- Membership fee = $20.
- Discount = 20% of $240 = \( 0.2 \times 240 = 48 \) dollars.
- Total cost after discount = \( 240 - 48 = 192 \) dollars.
- Total cost including membership fee = \( 192 + 20 = 212 \) dollars.

#### Option 2: Do not become a member (get a 5% discount).
- Discount = 5% of $240 = \( 0.05 \times 240 = 12 \) dollars.
- Total cost after discount = \( 240 - 12 = 228 \) dollars.

### Step 4: Compare the two options.
- Total cost with membership = $212.
- Total cost without membership = $228.

The least amount Arjun can spend is **$212**.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Yusuf is rolling a twenty-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row, than that he rolls four even numbers in a row?",50.0,"To solve this problem, we will calculate the probabilities of the two events and then find the difference in percentage points between them.

---

### Step 1: Probability of rolling a number greater than 5
A twenty-sided die has numbers from 1 to 20. The numbers greater than 5 are \(6, 7, 8, \dots, 20\). This is a total of:

\[
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ numbers}.
\]

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a single roll is:

\[
P(\text{greater than 5}) = \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4}.
\]

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 **twice in a row** is:

\[
P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) = P(\text{greater than 5}) \times P(\text{greater than 5}) = \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{16}.
\]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[
P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) = \frac{9}{16} \times 100 = 56.25\%.
\]

---

### Step 2: Probability of rolling an even number
The even numbers on a twenty-sided die are \(2, 4, 6, \dots, 20\). This is a total of:

\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ numbers}.
\]

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:

\[
P(\text{even}) = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

The probability of rolling an even number **four times in a row** is:

\[
P(\text{even four times}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16}.
\]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[
P(\text{even four times}) = \frac{1}{16} \times 100 = 6.25\%.
\]

---

### Step 3: Difference in percentage points
The difference in percentage points between the two probabilities is:

\[
56.25\% - 6.25\% = 50\%.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
It is **50 percentage points more likely** that Yusuf rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row than that he rolls four even numbers in a row.",5.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the problem.
We are comparing two probabilities:
1. The probability that Yusuf rolls a number greater than 5 **twice in a row**.
2. The probability that Yusuf rolls **four even numbers in a row**.

We need to calculate these probabilities and then find the difference between them, expressed as a difference in percentage points.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5.
A twenty-sided die has numbers from 1 to 20. The numbers greater than 5 are: 6, 7, 8, ..., 20. This is a total of \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a single roll is:
\[
\frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4}.
\]

To roll a number greater than 5 **twice in a row**, we multiply the probabilities of each roll:
\[
\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) \times \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \frac{9}{16}.
\]

Converting this to a percentage:
\[
\frac{9}{16} \times 100 = 56.25\%.
\]

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is **56.25%**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row.
The even numbers on a twenty-sided die are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 20. This is a total of \( 20 \div 2 = 10 \) numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
\frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

To roll four even numbers in a row, we multiply the probabilities of each roll:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{16}.
\]

Converting this to a percentage:
\[
\frac{1}{16} \times 100 = 6.25\%.
\]

So, the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is **6.25%**.

---

### Step 4: Find the difference in percentage points.
The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is **56.25%**.
The probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is **6.25%**.

The difference in percentage points is:
\[
56.25\% - 6.25\% = 50\%.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Mia went to her greenhouse to pick some blueberries and found 2/3 as many beetles as bees in the plot. Mia then found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. In addition, she saw 24 wasps, and 9 bees. What percentage of animals in the plot were rabbits?",20.0,"To determine the percentage of animals in the plot that were rabbits, let's break the problem into steps:

---

### Step 1: Identify the number of each type of animal.
- **Bees**: Mia saw **9 bees**.
- **Beetles**: There were \( \frac{2}{3} \) as many beetles as bees. Since there are 9 bees:
  \[
  \text{Number of beetles} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
  \]
  So, there are **6 beetles**.
- **White animals**: Mia saw **26 white animals**, half of which were rabbits. Therefore:
  \[
  \text{Number of rabbits} = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13
  \]
  The other half of the white animals are not rabbits, so there are also **13 other white animals**.
- **Wasps**: Mia saw **24 wasps**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of animals in the plot.
The total number of animals is the sum of all the animals:
\[
\text{Total animals} = \text{Bees} + \text{Beetles} + \text{Rabbits} + \text{Other white animals} + \text{Wasps}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Total animals} = 9 + 6 + 13 + 13 + 24 = 65
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the percentage of animals that are rabbits.
The percentage of animals that are rabbits is given by:
\[
\text{Percentage of rabbits} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of rabbits}}{\text{Total animals}} \right) \times 100
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Percentage of rabbits} = \left( \frac{13}{65} \right) \times 100 = 20\%
\]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of animals in the plot that were rabbits is **20%**.",20.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Mia found **26 white animals**, half of which were rabbits.  
   - Half of 26 is \( 26 / 2 = 13 \).  
   - So, there are **13 rabbits**.

2. Mia also saw **24 wasps** and **9 bees**.  
   - The total number of bees is \( 9 \).

3. Mia found **2/3 as many beetles as bees**.  
   - The number of beetles is \( (2/3) \times 9 = 6 \).  
   - So, there are **6 beetles**.

4. Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in the plot.  
   - The total includes rabbits, wasps, bees, and beetles.  
   - Total animals = \( 13 \) (rabbits) + \( 24 \) (wasps) + \( 9 \) (bees) + \( 6 \) (beetles) = \( 52 \).

5. Next, we calculate the percentage of animals that are rabbits.  
   - The percentage is given by \( (\text{number of rabbits} / \text{total animals}) \times 100 \).  
   - Substituting the values:  
     \[
     (\text{13} / \text{52}) \times 100 = 25\%.

Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 25.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","**Reflection on the Incorrect Answer:**

1. **Explanation of the Error:**  
   My initial answer of 25.0% was incorrect because I misunderstood the relationships between the quantities and made errors in interpreting the problem. Specifically:
   - I failed to correctly calculate the total number of animals in the plot. I likely overlooked some animals or miscalculated their totals.
   - I may have misinterpreted the problem by not properly accounting for the number of rabbits or dividing by the wrong total when calculating the percentage.
   - I did not carefully verify my calculations step-by-step, which led to an incorrect final answer.

2. **Error Keywords:**  
   - Misinterpretation of problem  
   - Incorrect total calculation  
   - Incorrect percentage calculation  

---

**Correct Solution (Step-by-Step):**

1. **Identify the quantities in the problem:**  
   - Mia found **9 bees**.  
   - There were **2/3 as many beetles as bees**. This means the number of beetles is:  
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ beetles}.
     \]  
   - Mia found **26 white animals**, half of which were rabbits. This means the number of rabbits is:  
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13 \text{ rabbits}.
     \]  
     The other half of the white animals are not rabbits, so there are:  
     \[
     26 - 13 = 13 \text{ other white animals}.
     \]  
   - Mia also saw **24 wasps**.

2. **Calculate the total number of animals in the plot:**  
   Add up all the animals:  
   \[
   9 \text{ (bees)} + 6 \text{ (beetles)} + 13 \text{ (rabbits)} + 13 \text{ (other white animals)} + 24 \text{ (wasps)} = 65 \text{ total animals}.
   \]

3. **Calculate the percentage of animals that are rabbits:**  
   The number of rabbits is 13, and the total number of animals is 65. The percentage of animals that are rabbits is:  
   \[
   \frac{13}{65} \times 100 = 20\%.
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**  
   The percentage of animals in the plot that are rabbits is **20%**.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Mrs. Lee is looking for a new townhouse that will not go beyond her $340000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $400000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?",11000.0,"To determine how much more the total cost of the townhouse will be than Mrs. Lee's budget, let's break the problem into steps:

---

### Step 1: Calculate the discounted selling price
Mrs. Lee can get a **25% discount** on the selling price of $400,000. The discount amount is:

\[
\text{Discount} = 25\% \times 400,000 = 0.25 \times 400,000 = 100,000
\]

The discounted selling price is:

\[
\text{Discounted Selling Price} = 400,000 - 100,000 = 300,000
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the brokerage fee
The brokerage fee is **5% of the selling price**. Using the discounted selling price of $300,000:

\[
\text{Brokerage Fee} = 5\% \times 300,000 = 0.05 \times 300,000 = 15,000
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the transfer fee
The transfer fee is **12% of the selling price**. Using the discounted selling price of $300,000:

\[
\text{Transfer Fee} = 12\% \times 300,000 = 0.12 \times 300,000 = 36,000
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost
The total cost includes the discounted selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Discounted Selling Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 300,000 + 15,000 + 36,000 = 351,000
\]

---

### Step 5: Compare the total cost to Mrs. Lee's budget
Mrs. Lee's budget is $340,000. The amount by which the total cost exceeds her budget is:

\[
\text{Excess Amount} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Budget}
\]

\[
\text{Excess Amount} = 351,000 - 340,000 = 11,000
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The total cost will exceed Mrs. Lee's budget by **$11,000**.",11000.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the discounted selling price**:  
   Mrs. Lee can get a 25% discount on the selling price of $400,000.  
   The discount amount is:  
   \( 25\% \times 400,000 = 0.25 \times 400,000 = 100,000 \).  
   So, the discounted selling price is:  
   \( 400,000 - 100,000 = 300,000 \).

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee**:  
   The brokerage fee is 5% of the discounted selling price.  
   \( 5\% \times 300,000 = 0.05 \times 300,000 = 15,000 \).

3. **Calculate the transfer fee**:  
   The transfer fee is 12% of the discounted selling price.  
   \( 12\% \times 300,000 = 0.12 \times 300,000 = 36,000 \).

4. **Find the total cost**:  
   The total cost includes the discounted selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee.  
   Total cost = \( 300,000 + 15,000 + 36,000 = 351,000 \).

5. **Compare the total cost to Mrs. Lee's budget**:  
   Mrs. Lee's budget is $340,000. The total cost is $351,000.  
   The amount by which the total cost exceeds her budget is:  
   \( 351,000 - 340,000 = 11,000 \).

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Dr. Brown sold his villa for $550000. He paid the legal fees that amounted to 2% of the selling price and also paid a realtor fee that is 5% of the selling price. He also paid $440000 for the remaining loan amount on the villa, and $5000 for closing costs. Dr. Brown used the net proceeds from selling the villa to invest in stocks. The stocks gained 10% each year for two years. How much were Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years?",80465.0,"To solve this problem, we will calculate step by step:

---

### Step 1: Calculate the legal fees
The legal fees are **2% of the selling price**. The selling price is $550,000.

\[
\text{Legal fees} = 2\% \times 550,000 = 0.02 \times 550,000 = 11,000
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the realtor fee
The realtor fee is **5% of the selling price**. The selling price is $550,000.

\[
\text{Realtor fee} = 5\% \times 550,000 = 0.05 \times 550,000 = 27,500
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total expenses
Dr. Brown also paid $440,000 for the remaining loan amount and $5,000 for closing costs. Adding all the expenses together:

\[
\text{Total expenses} = \text{Legal fees} + \text{Realtor fee} + \text{Loan amount} + \text{Closing costs}
\]

\[
\text{Total expenses} = 11,000 + 27,500 + 440,000 + 5,000 = 483,500
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the net proceeds from selling the villa
The net proceeds are the selling price minus the total expenses:

\[
\text{Net proceeds} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Total expenses}
\]

\[
\text{Net proceeds} = 550,000 - 483,500 = 66,500
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the value of the investment after two years
Dr. Brown invested the net proceeds ($66,500) in stocks, which gained **10% each year** for two years. To calculate the value of the investment after two years, we use the formula for compound interest:

\[
\text{Future value} = \text{Principal} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^n
\]

### Final Answer:
Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years are **$80,465**.",80465.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Dr. Brown sold his villa for $550,000.  
He paid the following expenses:  
1. Legal fees: 2% of the selling price.  
   Legal fees = 2% of $550,000 = (2 / 100) * $550,000 = $11,000.  

2. Realtor fee: 5% of the selling price.  
   Realtor fee = 5% of $550,000 = (5 / 100) * $550,000 = $27,500.  

3. Remaining loan amount: $440,000.  

4. Closing costs: $5,000.  

Now, let's calculate the total expenses:  
Total expenses = Legal fees + Realtor fee + Loan amount + Closing costs  
Total expenses = $11,000 + $27,500 + $440,000 + $5,000 = $483,500.  

Next, we calculate Dr. Brown's net proceeds from selling the villa:  
Net proceeds = Selling price - Total expenses  
Net proceeds = $550,000 - $483,500 = $66,500.  

Dr. Brown invested the net proceeds ($66,500) in stocks, which gained 10% each year for two years.  
To calculate the value of the investment after two years, we use the formula for compound interest:  
Final value = Initial value * (1 + rate)^time  
Here, Initial value = $66,500, rate = 10% = 0.10, and time = 2 years.  

Final value = $66,500 * (1 + 0.10)^2  
Final value = $66,500 * (1.10)^2  
Final value = $66,500 * 1.21 = $80,465.

Later, Uma saw another 10-foot shark with 6 remoras, each 8 inches long, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?",45.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras, taking into account the remoras' lengths and the number of remoras attached to each shark. Let's break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total length of remoras on the 40-foot shark
- The 40-foot shark initially has **18 remoras**, each **16 inches long**.
- Convert the remoras' length from inches to feet (since the shark's length is in feet):
  \[
  16 \, \text{inches} = \frac{16}{12} \, \text{feet} = \frac{4}{3} \, \text{feet}.
  \]
- Total length of all 18 remoras:
  \[
  18 \times \frac{4}{3} = 24 \, \text{feet}.
  \]

---

### Step 2: Account for the remoras that swam away
- **1/6 of the remoras swam away**:
  \[
  \frac{1}{6} \times 18 = 3 \, \text{remoras}.
  \]
- Remaining number of remoras:
  \[
  18 - 3 = 15 \, \text{remoras}.

- Total length of the remaining remoras:
  \[
  15 \times \frac{4}{3} = 20 \, \text{feet}.
  \]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the percentage of the 40-foot shark's body length covered by the remoras
- The shark's body length is **40 feet**.
- Percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras:
  \[
  \frac{\text{Total length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \times 100 = \frac{20}{40} \times 100 = 50\%.
  \]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the total length of remoras on the 10-foot shark
- The 10-foot shark has **6 remoras**, each **8 inches long**.
- Convert the remoras' length from inches to feet:
  \[
  8 \, \text{inches} = \frac{8}{12} \, \text{feet} = \frac{2}{3} \, \text{feet}.
  \]
- Total length of all 6 remoras:
  \[
  6 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \, \text{feet}.

- The percentages for the two sharks are **50%** and **40%**.
- Average percentage:
  \[
  \frac{50 + 40}{2} = 45\%.
  \]

---

### Final Answer:
On average, **45%** of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras.",45.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the first shark (40-foot shark with 18 remoras).
- The shark is 40 feet long. Converting this to inches (since the remoras' lengths are in inches), we know:
  \[
  1 \text{ foot} = 12 \text{ inches}, \text{ so } 40 \text{ feet} = 40 \times 12 = 480 \text{ inches}.
  \]
- Each remora is 16 inches long, and there are 18 remoras. So, the total length of all the remoras is:
  \[
  18 \times 16 = 288 \text{ inches}.
  \]
- However, 1/6 of the remoras swam away. The number of remoras that swam away is:
  \[
  \frac{1}{6} \times 18 = 3 \text{ remoras}.
  \]
- The remaining number of remoras is:
  \[
  18 - 3 = 15 \text{ remoras}.
  \]
- The total length of the remaining remoras is:
  \[
  15 \times 16 = 240 \text{ inches}.
  \]
- The percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras is:
  \[
  \frac{\text{Total length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \times 100 = \frac{240}{480} \times 100 = 50\%.
  \]

### Step 2: Analyze the second shark (10-foot shark with 6 remoras).
- The shark is 10 feet long. Converting this to inches:
  \[
  10 \text{ feet} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ inches}.
  \]
- Each remora is 8 inches long, and there are 6 remoras. So, the total length of all the remoras is:
  \[
  6 \times 8 = 48 \text{ inches}.
  \]
- The percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras is:
  \[
  \frac{\text{Total length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \times 100 = \frac{48}{120} \times 100 = 40\%.
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the average percentage of body length covered by the remoras for both sharks.
- The percentages for the two sharks are 50% and 40%. The average percentage is:
  \[
  \frac{50 + 40}{2} = 45\%.
  \]

### Final Answer:
The average percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras is **45%**.",45.0,1,1,,,,0,1,45.0,,,
p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Carlos places almonds on bowls and tables. Each bowl can hold 24 almonds while each table can hold three times that. Carlos has 720 almonds, 7 bowls and 3 tables. Unfortunately, 2 tables break. Carlos then eats one-fifth of all the almonds. How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?",14.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the capacity of each table
Each table can hold **three times** the number of almonds a bowl can hold. Since each bowl holds **24 almonds**, each table can hold:
\[
3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ almonds.}
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total capacity of the 7 bowls and 3 tables
Carlos has **7 bowls** and **3 tables**. The total capacity of the bowls is:
\[
7 \times 24 = 168 \text{ almonds.}
\]
The total capacity of the 3 tables is:
\[
3 \times 72 = 216 \text{ almonds.}
\]
Thus, the total capacity of the bowls and tables is:
\[
168 + 216 = 384 \text{ almonds.}
\]

---

### Step 3: Account for the 2 broken tables
Since **2 tables break**, only **1 table** remains. The capacity of the remaining table is:
\[
1 \times 72 = 72 \text{ almonds.}
\]
The total capacity of the 7 bowls and 1 remaining table is:
\[
168 + 72 = 240 \text{ almonds.}
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the number of almonds Carlos eats
Carlos starts with **720 almonds**. He eats **one-fifth** of them:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 720 = 144 \text{ almonds.}
\]
The number of almonds remaining after Carlos eats is:
\[
720 - 144 = 576 \text{ almonds.}
\]

---

### Step 5: Determine how many almonds need to be placed
Carlos has **576 almonds** and a total capacity of **240 almonds** (from the 7 bowls and 1 remaining table). The number of almonds that cannot be placed is:
\[
576 - 240 = 336 \text{ almonds.}
\]

---

### Step 6: Calculate how many more bowls are needed
Each bowl can hold **24 almonds**. To find the number of additional bowls needed to hold the remaining **336 almonds**, divide:
\[
\frac{336}{24} = 14 \text{ bowls.}
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Carlos needs **14 more bowls** to place all the remaining almonds.",14.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Carlos has 720 almonds in total.  
Each bowl can hold 24 almonds, and each table can hold three times that, which is \( 3 \times 24 = 72 \) almonds.

### Step 1: Calculate the total capacity of the 7 bowls and 3 tables.
- The 7 bowls can hold \( 7 \times 24 = 168 \) almonds.
- The 3 tables can hold \( 3 \times 72 = 216 \) almonds.
- So, the total capacity of the bowls and tables is \( 168 + 216 = 384 \) almonds.

### Step 2: Account for the 2 broken tables.
If 2 tables break, only 1 table remains.  
The remaining table can hold \( 1 \times 72 = 72 \) almonds.  
The 7 bowls still hold \( 168 \) almonds.  
So, the new total capacity is \( 168 + 72 = 240 \) almonds.

### Step 3: Calculate how many almonds Carlos eats.
Carlos eats one-fifth of all the almonds.  
The total number of almonds is 720, so he eats \( \frac{1}{5} \times 720 = 144 \) almonds.  
The remaining almonds are \( 720 - 144 = 576 \).

### Step 4: Determine how many almonds are left to be placed.
The remaining capacity of the bowls and the single table is \( 240 \).  
Carlos has \( 576 \) almonds left, so the number of almonds that still need to be placed is \( 576 - 240 = 336 \).

### Step 5: Calculate how many more bowls Carlos needs.
Each bowl can hold 24 almonds.  
To place the remaining 336 almonds, Carlos needs \( \frac{336}{24} = 14 \) bowls.  
Since Carlos already has 7 bowls, the additional number of bowls he needs is \( 14 - 7 = 7 \).

Now, look at this question:
Question: Carlos places almonds on bowls and tables. Each bowl can hold 24 almonds while each table can hold three times that. Carlos has 720 almonds, 7 bowls and 3 tables. Unfortunately, 2 tables break. Carlos then eats one-fifth of all the almonds. How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?
Your initial answer was: Let's think step by step.

Carlos has 720 almonds in total.  
Each bowl can hold 24 almonds, and each table can hold three times that, which is \( 3 \times 24 = 72 \) almonds.

### Step 1: Calculate the total capacity of the 7 bowls and 3 tables.
- The 7 bowls can hold \( 7 \times 24 = 168 \) almonds.
- The 3 tables can hold \( 3 \times 72 = 216 \) almonds.
- So, the total capacity of the bowls and tables is \( 168 + 216 = 384 \) almonds.

### Step 2: Account for the 2 broken tables.
If 2 tables break, only 1 table remains.  
The remaining table can hold \( 1 \times 72 = 72 \) almonds.  
The 7 bowls still hold \( 168 \) almonds.  
So, the new total capacity is \( 168 + 72 = 240 \) almonds.

### Step 3: Calculate how many almonds Carlos eats.
Carlos eats one-fifth of all the almonds.  
The total number of almonds is 720, so he eats \( \frac{1}{5} \times 720 = 144 \) almonds.  
The remaining almonds are \( 720 - 144 = 576 \).

### Step 4: Determine how many almonds are left to be placed.
The remaining capacity of the bowls and the single table is \( 240 \).  
Carlos has \( 576 \) almonds left, so the number of almonds that still need to be placed is \( 576 - 240 = 336 \).

### Step 5: Calculate how many more bowls Carlos needs.
Each bowl can hold 24 almonds.  
To place the remaining 336 almonds, Carlos needs \( \frac{336}{24} = 14 \) bowls.  
Since Carlos already has 7 bowls, the additional number of bowls he needs is \( 14 - 7 = 7 \).

The answer is 7.

[Example Input]  
Question: Sarah is organizing a party. She has 500 candies to distribute into bags and bowls. Each bag can hold 30 candies, and each bowl can hold twice as many as a bag. Sarah has 10 bags and 5 bowls. Unfortunately, 2 bowls break. Sarah then gives away one-fourth of the remaining candies to her friends. How many more bags does Sarah need to store all the remaining candies?  

Wrong answer: Sarah calculates the total capacity of the bags and bowls incorrectly by forgetting to account for the broken bowls. She also miscalculates the number of candies left after giving away one-fourth. As a result, she underestimates the number of additional bags needed.  

---  

[Example Output]  

**Explanation:**  
I miscalculated the total capacity of the bags and bowls because I forgot to account for the broken bowls. Additionally, I made an error when calculating the number of candies left after Sarah gave away one-fourth. These mistakes caused me to underestimate the number of additional bags needed.  

**Error Keywords:**  
- Misinterpretation of problem constraints  
- Incorrect subtraction of broken items  
- Miscalculation of fractions  
- Underestimation of final result  

**Solution:**  
1. Calculate the total capacity of the bags and bowls before any breakage:  
   - Each bag holds 30 candies, so 10 bags can hold \( 10 \times 30 = 300 \) candies.  
   - Each bowl holds twice as many as a bag, so each bowl holds \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) candies.  
   - 5 bowls can hold \( 5 \times 60 = 300 \) candies.  
   - Total capacity before breakage = \( 300 + 300 = 600 \) candies.  

2. Account for the broken bowls:  
   - 2 bowls break, so the remaining bowls are \( 5 - 2 = 3 \).  
   - The remaining bowls can hold \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \) candies.  
   - Total capacity after breakage = \( 300 + 180 = 480 \) candies.  

3. Calculate the number of candies left after Sarah gives away one-fourth:  
   - Sarah starts with 500 candies.  
   - She gives away \( \frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125 \) candies.  
   - Remaining candies = \( 500 - 125 = 375 \).  

4. Determine if the remaining candies fit in the available capacity:  
   - The available capacity is 480 candies, which is more than 375 candies.  
   - No additional bags are needed.  

**Instructions:**  
1. Carefully read the problem and identify all constraints (e.g., broken items, fractions, etc.).  
2. Calculate the total capacity of all containers before any changes.  
3. Adjust the capacity based on any changes (e.g., broken items).  
4. Accurately calculate the remaining quantity after any reductions (e.g., fractions or subtractions).  
5. Compare the remaining quantity to the available capacity to determine if additional containers are needed.  

**Advice:**  
1. Always double-check calculations involving fractions or percentages.  
2. Pay close attention to problem constraints, such as broken items or changes in capacity.  
3. Break the problem into smaller steps and verify each step before moving on.  
4. Re-read the problem after solving to ensure all parts of the question are addressed.

**Error Keywords:**  
- Misinterpretation of problem constraints  
- Incorrect subtraction of broken items  
- Miscalculation of fractions  
- Underestimation of final result  

---

**Correct Solution (Step-by-Step):**

1. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and tables before any breakage:**  
   - Each bowl can hold 24 almonds. With 7 bowls, the total capacity of the bowls is:  
     \[
     7 \times 24 = 168 \text{ almonds.}
     \]  
   - Each table can hold three times as many almonds as a bowl, so each table can hold:  
     \[
     3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ almonds.}
     \]  
   - With 3 tables, the total capacity of the tables is:  
     \[
     3 \times 72 = 216 \text{ almonds.}
     \]  
   - Total capacity before any breakage is:  
     \[
     168 + 216 = 384 \text{ almonds.}
     \]  

2. **Account for the broken tables:**  
   - 2 tables break, leaving only 1 table. The remaining table can hold:  
     \[
     1 \times 72 = 72 \text{ almonds.}
     \]  
   - The total capacity after the breakage is:  
     \[
     168 + 72 = 240 \text{ almonds.}
     \]  

3. **Calculate the number of almonds remaining after Carlos eats one-fifth:**  
   - Carlos starts with 720 almonds. He eats one-fifth of them:  
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} \times 720 = 144 \text{ almonds.}
     \]  
   - The remaining almonds are:  
     \[
     720 - 144 = 576 \text{ almonds.}
     \]  

4. **Determine if the remaining almonds fit in the available capacity:**  
   - The available capacity is 240 almonds, but Carlos has 576 almonds remaining.  
   - The number of almonds that cannot fit in the current capacity is:  
     \[
     576 - 240 = 336 \text{ almonds.}
     \]  

5. **Calculate how many additional bowls are needed to store the remaining almonds:**  
   - Each bowl can hold 24 almonds. To find the number of additional bowls needed, divide the remaining almonds by the capacity of one bowl:  
     \[
     \frac{336}{24} = 14 \text{ bowls.}
     \]  
   - Carlos needs **14 additional bowls** to store all the remaining almonds.  

---

**Final Answer:**  
Carlos needs **14 more bowls**.

   - Each bowl holds twice as many as a bag, so each bowl holds \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) candies.  
   - 5 bowls can hold \( 5 \times 60 = 300 \) candies.  
   - Total capacity before breakage = \( 300 + 300 = 600 \) candies.  

2. Account for the broken bowls:  
   - 2 bowls break, so the remaining bowls are \( 5 - 2 = 3 \).  
   - The remaining bowls can hold \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \) candies.  
   - Total capacity after breakage = \( 300 + 180 = 480 \) candies.  

3. Calculate the number of candies left after Sarah gives away one-fourth:  
   - Sarah starts with 500 candies.  
   - She gives away \( \frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125 \) candies.  
   - Remaining candies = \( 500 - 125 = 375 \).  

4. Determine if the remaining candies fit in the available capacity:  
   - The available capacity is 480 candies, which is more than 375 candies.  
   - No additional bags are needed.  

**Instructions:**  
1. Carefully read the problem and identify all constraints (e.g., broken items, fractions, etc.).  
2. Calculate the total capacity of all containers before any changes.  
3. Adjust the capacity based on any changes (e.g., broken items).  
4. Accurately calculate the remaining quantity after any reductions (e.g., fractions or subtractions).  
5. Compare the remaining quantity to the available capacity to determine if additional containers are needed.  

**Advice:**  
1. Always double-check calculations involving fractions or percentages.  
2. Pay close attention to problem constraints, such as broken items or changes in capacity.  
3. Break the problem into smaller steps and verify each step before moving on.  
4. Re-read the problem after solving to ensure all parts of the question are addressed.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Diego is 19 years old. In 9 years, his cousin Aisha will be 2 times as old as Diego is now. Diego's brother, Esteban, is 6 years younger than Diego, and Aisha sister Nadia is 10 years older than Esteban. What will be the average of all four in 4 years?",25.0,"We are tasked with finding the average age of Diego, Aisha, Esteban, and Nadia in 4 years. Let's break this problem into steps.

---

### Step 1: Define the current ages of everyone
- Diego is **19 years old**.
- In 9 years, Aisha will be **2 times as old as Diego is now**. Since Diego is currently 19, \( 2 \times 19 = 38 \). Therefore, Aisha's current age is:
  \[
  38 - 9 = 29 \, \text{years old}.
  \]
- Esteban is **6 years younger than Diego**. Since Diego is 19, Esteban's current age is:
  \[
  19 - 6 = 13 \, \text{years old}.
  \]
- Nadia is **10 years older than Esteban**. Since Esteban is 13, Nadia's current age is:
  \[
  13 + 10 = 23 \, \text{years old}.
  \]

Thus, the current ages are:
- Diego: 19
- Aisha: 29
- Esteban: 13
- Nadia: 23

---

### Step 2: Calculate their ages in 4 years
In 4 years, each person's age will increase by 4. Their ages will be:
- Diego: \( 19 + 4 = 23 \)
- Aisha: \( 29 + 4 = 33 \)
- Esteban: \( 13 + 4 = 17 \)
- Nadia: \( 23 + 4 = 27 \)

---

### Step 3: Find the average of their ages in 4 years
The average is calculated by summing their ages and dividing by the number of people. The sum of their ages in 4 years is:
\[
23 + 33 + 17 + 27 = 100
\]
The average is:
\[
\frac{100}{4} = 25
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The average of their ages in 4 years will be **25 years**.",25.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Diego's current age**: Diego is 19 years old.

2. **Aisha's age in 9 years**: In 9 years, Aisha will be 2 times as old as Diego is now.  
   Diego's current age is 19, so 2 times his age is \( 2 \times 19 = 38 \).  
   This means Aisha will be 38 years old in 9 years.  
   To find Aisha's current age, subtract 9 from 38:  
   \( 38 - 9 = 29 \).  
   So, Aisha is currently 29 years old.

3. **Esteban's current age**: Esteban is 6 years younger than Diego.  
   Diego is 19, so Esteban's age is \( 19 - 6 = 13 \).  
   So, Esteban is currently 13 years old.

4. **Nadia's current age**: Nadia is 10 years older than Esteban.  
   Esteban is 13, so Nadia's age is \( 13 + 10 = 23 \).  
   So, Nadia is currently 23 years old.

5. **Ages in 4 years**:  
   - Diego's age in 4 years: \( 19 + 4 = 23 \).  
   - Aisha's age in 4 years: \( 29 + 4 = 33 \).  
   - Esteban's age in 4 years: \( 13 + 4 = 17 \).  
   - Nadia's age in 4 years: \( 23 + 4 = 27 \).

6. **Average of their ages in 4 years**:  
   To find the average, add all their ages in 4 years and divide by 4:  
   \( 23 + 33 + 17 + 27 = 100 \).  
   Divide by 4:  
   \( 100 \div 4 = 25 \).

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Keisha is knitting winter wear for her 4 grandchildren. They're quadruplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a shawl, sweater, poncho, gloves, and mittens for each of them. It takes 5 skeins of wool to make a shawl, 6 for a sweater, 8 for a poncho, 8 for a pair of gloves, and 14 for a pair of mittens. Keisha wants to make two warm jackets for herself, each needing 8 skeins of wool. Each dozen skeins of wool costs $7. The store has a promotion where customers receive a $20 discount on purchases over $100. How much should Keisha pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?",85.0,"To determine how much Keisha should pay for all the skeins of wool she needs, let's break the problem into smaller steps.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of skeins needed for the grandchildren.

Keisha has 4 grandchildren, and she plans to make the following items for each of them:
- **Shawl**: 5 skeins each
- **Sweater**: 6 skeins each
- **Poncho**: 8 skeins each
- **Gloves**: 8 skeins each
- **Mittens**: 14 skeins each

#### Total skeins per grandchild:
\[
5 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 14 = 41 \text{ skeins per grandchild.}
\]

Since there are 4 grandchildren:
\[
41 \times 4 = 164 \text{ skeins for the grandchildren.}
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of skeins needed for Keisha's jackets.

Keisha wants to make **2 jackets**, each requiring 8 skeins:
\[
2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ skeins for the jackets.}
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of skeins needed.

Adding the skeins for the grandchildren and the jackets:
\[
164 + 16 = 180 \text{ skeins in total.}
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of the skeins.

Each dozen (12 skeins) costs $7. First, determine how many dozens are in 180 skeins:
\[
\frac{180}{12} = 15 \text{ dozens.}
\]

The cost for 15 dozens is:
\[
15 \times 7 = 105 \text{ dollars.}
\]

---

### Step 5: Apply the store's promotion.

The store offers a $20 discount on purchases over $100. Since Keisha's total is $105, she qualifies for the discount:
\[
105 - 20 = 85 \text{ dollars.}
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Keisha should pay **$85** for all the skeins of wool she needs.",85.0,1,"Keisha is knitting winter wear for her 4 grandchildren and herself. Let's calculate the total number of skeins of wool she needs and the total cost step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the wool needed for each grandchild
Each grandchild needs:
- 1 shawl (5 skeins)
- 1 sweater (6 skeins)
- 1 poncho (8 skeins)
- 1 pair of gloves (8 skeins)
- 1 pair of mittens (14 skeins)

The total wool needed for one grandchild is:
\[
5 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 14 = 41 \text{ skeins.}
\]

Since there are 4 grandchildren, the total wool needed for all grandchildren is:
\[
41 \times 4 = 164 \text{ skeins.}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the wool needed for Keisha's jackets
Keisha wants to make 2 jackets, each requiring 8 skeins of wool. The total wool needed for the jackets is:
\[
8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ skeins.}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total wool needed
The total wool needed for the grandchildren and Keisha is:
\[
164 + 16 = 180 \text{ skeins.}

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,Mohammed goes to the store to buy some rice. The normal brand of rice he buys costs ¥15 per kg. He has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 3 kgs of rice per day. The store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs; any additional rice is sold at the regular price. Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2. How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,"To calculate how much Mohammed has to pay, let's break the problem into smaller steps:

---

### Step 1: Calculate the price of the more expensive rice per kg.
The normal brand of rice costs ¥15 per kg. The more expensive brand costs **20% more**. To find the price of the more expensive rice:

\[
\text{Price of expensive rice per kg} = 15 + (20\% \times 15)
\]

\[
\text{Price of expensive rice per kg} = 15 + (0.2 \times 15) = 15 + 3 = 18
\]

So, the more expensive rice costs **¥18 per kg**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of rice Mohammed needs for a week.
Mohammed uses **3 kg of rice per day**. For a week (7 days), the total amount of rice he needs is:

\[
\text{Total rice needed} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \, \text{kg}
\]

---

### Step 3: Determine the cost of the first 10 kg of rice (with a 40% discount).
The store offers a **40% discount** on rice for the first 10 kg. The discounted price per kg is:

\[
\text{Discounted price per kg} = 18 - (40\% \times 18)
\]

\[
\text{Discounted price per kg} = 18 - (0.4 \times 18) = 18 - 7.2 = 10.8
\]

The cost of the first 10 kg of rice is:

\[
\text{Cost for first 10 kg} = 10 \times 10.8 = 108
\]

---

### Step 4: Determine the cost of the remaining 11 kg of rice (at the regular price).
Mohammed needs a total of 21 kg of rice, so the remaining amount after the first 10 kg is:

\[
\text{Remaining rice} = 21 - 10 = 11 \, \text{kg}
\]

The cost of the remaining 11 kg of rice (at the regular price of ¥18 per kg) is:

\[
\text{Cost for remaining 11 kg} = 11 \times 18 = 198
\]

---

### Step 5: Add the cost of the bagel.
Mohammed also buys a bagel for ¥2. 

---

### Step 6: Calculate the total cost.
The total cost is the sum of the cost for the first 10 kg of rice, the cost for the remaining 11 kg of rice, and the cost of the bagel:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for first 10 kg} + \text{Cost for remaining 11 kg} + \text{Cost of bagel}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 108 + 198 + 2 = 308

### Final Answer:
Mohammed has to pay **¥308**.",308.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the more expensive brand of rice per kg.**  
   The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg.  
   The more expensive brand costs 20% more.  
   To calculate the price of the more expensive brand:  
   \( 15 + (15 \times 0.20) = 15 + 3 = 18 \).  
   So, the more expensive brand costs ¥18 per kg.

2. **Calculate the total amount of rice Mohammed needs for a week.**  
   Mohammed uses 3 kg of rice per day.  
   For a week (7 days), he needs:  
   \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) kg of rice.

3. **Determine the cost of the first 10 kg of rice with the discount.**  
   The store offers a 40% discount on the first 10 kg of rice.  
   The discounted price per kg is:  
   \( 18 - (18 \times 0.40) = 18 - 7.2 = 10.8 \).  
   The cost for the first 10 kg is:  
   \( 10 \times 10.8 = 108 \).

4. **Determine the cost of the remaining 11 kg of rice at the regular price.**  
   Mohammed needs 21 kg in total, and 10 kg is discounted.  
   The remaining rice is:  
   \( 21 - 10 = 11 \) kg.  
   The regular price per kg is ¥18.  
   The cost for the remaining 11 kg is:  
   \( 11 \times 18 = 198 \).

5. **Add the cost of the bagel.**  
   Mohammed also buys a bagel for ¥2.

6. **Calculate the total cost.**  
   The total cost is:

During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Jasmine and Mia compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Jasmine has 36 signatures in her book, and Mia has 31. The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,"We are tasked with determining how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week during the remaining 2 weeks of spring break to ensure that Jasmine and Mia reach a total of 145 signatures.

---

### Step 1: Determine the total number of signatures they currently have.
Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures. Together, they currently have:
\[
36 + 31 = 67 \text{ signatures.}
\]

---

### Step 2: Determine how many more signatures they need to reach their goal.
Their goal is 145 signatures. The number of additional signatures they need is:
\[
145 - 67 = 78 \text{ signatures.}
\]

---

### Step 3: Account for Jasmine's reduced collection rate.
Jasmine collects signatures only on weekends during the remaining 2 weeks. If her weekly collection is reduced by 5 signatures per week, we need to calculate her new weekly collection rate.

Let \( x \) represent Jasmine's original weekly collection rate. Since she collected for 6 weeks and has 36 signatures, her weekly collection rate is:
\[
x = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \text{ signatures per week.}
\]

Now, her reduced weekly collection rate is:
\[
6 - 5 = 1 \text{ signature per week.}
\]

Over the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect:
\[
1 \times 2 = 2 \text{ signatures.}
\]

---

### Step 4: Determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect.
The total number of additional signatures needed is 78. Jasmine will contribute 2 of these signatures, so Mia needs to collect:
\[
78 - 2 = 76 \text{ signatures.}
\]

Mia has 2 weeks to collect these 76 signatures. Let \( y \) represent the number of signatures Mia collects per week. Then:
\[
2y = 76
\]

Solve for \( y \):
\[
y = \frac{76}{2} = 38
\]

Question: Jasmine and Mia are sisters from Nairobi who love collecting signatures from authors. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Jasmine and Mia compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Jasmine has 36 signatures in her book, and Mia has 31. The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?
Your initial answer was: Jasmine and Mia want to reach a total of 145 signatures by the end of their spring break. Let’s break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many signatures they already have.
Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures.  
So, the total number of signatures they currently have is:  
36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

### Correct Solution (Step-by-Step):

#### Step 1: Determine how many signatures Jasmine and Mia already have.
Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures.  
The total number of signatures they currently have is:  
\[
36 + 31 = 67 \text{ signatures.}
\]

#### Step 2: Calculate how many more signatures they need to reach their goal.
Their goal is 145 signatures. They already have 67 signatures.  
The number of signatures they still need is:  
\[
145 - 67 = 78 \text{ signatures.}
\]

#### Step 3: Determine how many signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks.
Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week.  
Assume Jasmine was collecting **10 signatures per week** before (a reasonable assumption based on the problem).  
Now, Jasmine collects:  
\[
10 - 5 = 5 \text{ signatures per week.}
\]  
Over 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect:  
\[
5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ signatures.}
\]

#### Step 4: Determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect.
The total number of signatures they still need is 78. Jasmine will contribute 10 of these signatures.  
This means Mia needs to collect:  
\[
78 - 10 = 68 \text{ signatures.}
\]

#### Step 5: Calculate Mia's required weekly collection rate.
Mia has 2 weeks to collect 68 signatures. Her weekly collection rate must be:  
\[
\frac{68}{2} = 34 \text{ signatures per week.}
\]

#### Final Answer:
Mia needs to collect **34 signatures per week** to ensure they reach their goal.

[Example Input]  
Question: Alex and Taylor are friends who enjoy running. Over the course of 4 weeks, Alex runs a total of 48 miles, while Taylor runs 56 miles. They decide to train together for a marathon and set a goal of running a combined total of 200 miles over the next 6 weeks. However, Alex plans to reduce his weekly mileage by 2 miles per week due to a busy schedule, while Taylor plans to increase her weekly mileage. How many miles per week will Taylor need to run to ensure they meet their goal?  

Wrong answer: Taylor needs to run 12 miles per week.  
Reasoning: I calculated the total miles Alex and Taylor had already run (48 + 56 = 104). Then, I subtracted this from the goal (200 - 104 = 96). I assumed Alex would run the same amount each week (48 ÷ 4 = 12 miles per week) and calculated his contribution over 6 weeks (12 × 6 = 72). I subtracted this from the remaining miles (96 - 72 = 24) and divided it by 2 weeks, assuming Taylor would only need to run for 2 weeks (24 ÷ 2 = 12).  

---  
[Example Output]  

**Explanation:**  
I miscalculated Alex's contribution by failing to account for his reduced weekly mileage. I also misinterpreted the problem by assuming Taylor would only run for 2 weeks instead of the full 6 weeks.  

**Error Keywords:**  
- Misinterpretation of problem  
- Incorrect setup of equations  
- Miscalculation of contributions  

**Solution:**  
1. Calculate the total miles Alex and Taylor have already run: \( 48 + 56 = 104 \).  
2. Subtract this from the goal: \( 200 - 104 = 96 \).  
3. Determine Alex's weekly mileage reduction: \( 48 \div 4 = 12 \) miles per week initially, reducing by 2 miles per week.  
   - Week 1: \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) miles  
   - Week 2: \( 10 - 2 = 8 \) miles  
   - Week 3: \( 8 - 2 = 6 \) miles  
   - Week 4: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) miles  
   - Week 5: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) miles  
   - Week 6: \( 2 - 2 = 0 \) miles  
   - Total: \( 10 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 30 \) miles.  
4. Subtract Alex's contribution from the remaining miles: \( 96 - 30 = 66 \).  
5. Divide this by 6 weeks to find Taylor's required weekly mileage: \( 66 \div 6 = 11 \) miles per week.  

Correct answer: Taylor needs to run **11 miles per week**.  

**Instructions:**  
1. Carefully read the problem and identify the total goal, current progress, and any changes in weekly contributions.  
2. Set up equations or calculations to account for changes in contributions over time.  
3. Verify that all contributions (e.g., reductions or increases) are applied correctly over the specified time period.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Jasmine and Mia are sisters from Nairobi who love collecting signatures from authors. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Jasmine and Mia compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Jasmine has 36 signatures in her book, and Mia has 31. The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 5.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","**Reflection on Incorrect Answer:**  
My initial answer of 5.0 was incorrect because I miscalculated the contributions of Jasmine and Mia during the remaining 2 weeks. Specifically, I failed to account for Jasmine's reduced weekly collection rate properly and did not correctly calculate the number of signatures Mia would need to collect per week to meet the goal. Additionally, I may have misinterpreted the problem or set up the equations incorrectly, leading to an incorrect solution.

**Error Keywords:**  
- Misinterpretation of problem  
- Incorrect setup of equations  
- Miscalculation of contributions  

---

**Correct Solution (Step-by-Step):**

1. **Determine the total number of signatures already collected:**  
   Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures.  
   \[
   \text{Total signatures so far} = 36 + 31 = 67
   \]

2. **Calculate the remaining signatures needed to reach the goal:**  
   The sisters want to reach 145 signatures in total.  
   \[
   \text{Remaining signatures needed} = 145 - 67 = 78
   \]

3. **Account for Jasmine's reduced weekly collection rate:**  
   Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week.  
   - Assume Jasmine's initial weekly collection rate was \( x \). Since the problem does not specify her initial rate, we can infer that her total collection over 6 weeks was 36 signatures.  
   - Jasmine's average weekly collection rate over the first 6 weeks:  
     \[
     \text{Average weekly rate} = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \, \text{signatures per week.}
     \]  
   - Jasmine's reduced weekly collection rate during the remaining 2 weeks:  
     \[
     \text{Reduced rate} = 6 - 5 = 1 \, \text{signature per week.}
     \]  
   - Jasmine's total contribution over the next 2 weeks:  
     \[
     \text{Jasmine's contribution} = 1 \times 2 = 2 \, \text{signatures.}
     \]

4. **Calculate the remaining signatures Mia needs to collect:**  
   Subtract Jasmine's contribution from the remaining signatures needed:  
   \[
   \text{Remaining signatures for Mia} = 78 - 2 = 76
   \]

5. **Determine Mia's required weekly collection rate:**  
   Mia has 2 weeks to collect 76 signatures. Her weekly collection rate must be:  
   \[
   \text{Mia's weekly rate} = \frac{76}{2} = 38 \, \text{signatures per week.}
   \]

**Correct Answer:**  
Mia needs to collect **38 signatures per week** to ensure they reach their goal.

---

**Instructions for Solving This Problem in the Future:**  
1. **Read the problem carefully** and identify the total goal, current progress, and any changes in weekly contributions.  
2. **Calculate the total signatures already collected** and subtract this from the goal to find the remaining signatures needed.  
3. **Account for changes in individual contributions:**  
   - For reductions, subtract the specified amount from the initial rate.  
   - For increases, add the specified amount to the initial rate.  
4. **Calculate each person's contribution over the remaining time period** and determine how much is left for the other person to contribute.  
5. **Solve for the unknown variable** (e.g., Mia's weekly rate) by dividing the remaining signatures by the number of weeks.  
6. **Verify your solution** by adding up all contributions to ensure they meet the goal.

---

**General Advice for Similar Problems:**  
- **Break the problem into smaller parts:** Focus on current progress, remaining goal, and individual contributions.  
- **Pay attention to changes in rates:** Apply reductions or increases consistently over the specified time period.  
- **Double-check your interpretation:** Ensure you are solving for the correct variable and that all contributions are accounted for.  
- **Verify your final answer:** Plug your solution back into the problem to confirm it meets the goal.

How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,"We are tasked with determining how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week during the remaining 2 weeks of spring break to ensure that Jasmine and Mia reach a total of 145 signatures.

---

### Step 1: Determine the total number of signatures they currently have.
Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures. Together, they currently have:
\[
36 + 31 = 67 \text{ signatures.}
\]

---

### Step 2: Determine how many more signatures they need to reach their goal.
Their goal is 145 signatures. The number of additional signatures they need is:
\[
145 - 67 = 78 \text{ signatures.}
\]

---

### Step 3: Account for Jasmine's reduced collection rate.
Jasmine collects signatures only on weekends during the remaining 2 weeks. If her weekly collection is reduced by 5 signatures per week, we need to calculate her new weekly collection rate.

Let \( x \) represent Jasmine's original weekly collection rate. Since she collected for 6 weeks and has 36 signatures, her weekly collection rate is:
\[
x = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \text{ signatures per week.}
\]

Now, her reduced weekly collection rate is:
\[
6 - 5 = 1 \text{ signature per week.}
\]

Over the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect:
\[
1 \times 2 = 2 \text{ signatures.}
\]

---

### Step 4: Determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect.
The total number of additional signatures needed is 78. Jasmine will contribute 2 of these signatures, so Mia needs to collect:
\[
78 - 2 = 76 \text{ signatures.}
\]

Mia has 2 weeks to collect these 76 signatures. Let \( y \) represent the number of signatures Mia collects per week. Then:
\[
2y = 76
\]

Solve for \( y \):
\[
y = \frac{76}{2} = 38
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Mia needs to collect **38 signatures per week** during the remaining 2 weeks to ensure that she and Jasmine reach their goal of 145 signatures.",145.0,0,"Jasmine and Mia want to reach a total of 145 signatures by the end of their spring break. Let’s break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many signatures they already have.
Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures.  
So, the total number of signatures they currently have is:  
36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

### Step 2: Calculate how many more signatures they need to reach their goal.
Their goal is 145 signatures. They already have 67 signatures.  
The number of signatures they still need is:  
145 - 67 = 78 signatures.

### Step 3: Determine how many signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks.
Jasmine collects fewer signatures now because she can only collect on weekends. Her weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week.  
Let’s assume Jasmine was collecting **x** signatures per week before. Since her weekly collection is reduced by 5, she now collects **x - 5** signatures per week.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Jasmine and Mia are sisters from Nairobi who love collecting signatures from authors. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Jasmine and Mia compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Jasmine has 36 signatures in her book, and Mia has 31. The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?
Your initial answer was: Jasmine and Mia want to reach a total of 145 signatures by the end of their spring break. Let’s break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many signatures they already have.
Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures.  
So, the total number of signatures they currently have is:  
36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

### Step 2: Calculate how many more signatures they need to reach their goal.
Their goal is 145 signatures. They already have 67 signatures.  
The number of signatures they still need is:  
145 - 67 = 78 signatures.

### Step 3: Determine how many signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks.
Jasmine collects fewer signatures now because she can only collect on weekends. Her weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week.  
Let’s assume Jasmine was collecting **x** signatures per week before. Since her weekly collection is reduced by 5, she now collects **x - 5** signatures per week.  

However, the problem does not specify Jasmine's original weekly collection rate (**x**). To proceed, we need to assume Jasmine's new weekly collection rate is **y**. If you clarify this, I can continue solving!
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","### Reflection on the Incorrect Answer:

#### Explanation:
The initial answer was incorrect because I failed to fully analyze the problem and made an error in interpreting the information provided. Specifically:
1. I overcomplicated the problem by introducing unnecessary variables (e.g., ""x"" for Jasmine's original weekly collection rate) when the problem explicitly stated that Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week.
2. I did not calculate Jasmine's contribution correctly for the remaining 2 weeks, which led to an incomplete solution.
3. I did not focus on Mia's required weekly collection rate, which was the main question.

#### Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of problem
- Overcomplication
- Incomplete solution
- Failure to focus on the main question

### Correct Solution (Step-by-Step):

#### Step 1: Determine how many signatures Jasmine and Mia already have.
Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures.  
The total number of signatures they currently have is:  
\[
36 + 31 = 67 \text{ signatures.}
\]

#### Step 2: Calculate how many more signatures they need to reach their goal.
Their goal is 145 signatures. They already have 67 signatures.  
The number of signatures they still need is:  
\[
145 - 67 = 78 \text{ signatures.}
\]

#### Step 3: Determine how many signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks.
Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week.  
Assume Jasmine was collecting **10 signatures per week** before (a reasonable assumption based on the problem).  
Now, Jasmine collects:  
\[
10 - 5 = 5 \text{ signatures per week.}
\]  
Over 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect:  
\[
5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ signatures.}
\]

#### Step 4: Determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect.
The total number of signatures they still need is 78. Jasmine will contribute 10 of these signatures.  
This means Mia needs to collect:  
\[
78 - 10 = 68 \text{ signatures.}
\]

#### Step 5: Calculate Mia's required weekly collection rate.
Mia has 2 weeks to collect 68 signatures. Her weekly collection rate must be:  
\[
\frac{68}{2} = 34 \text{ signatures per week.}
\]

#### Final Answer:
Mia needs to collect **34 signatures per week** to ensure they reach their goal.

[Example Input]  
Question: Alex and Taylor are friends who enjoy running. Over the summer, Alex runs 4 miles every weekday, while Taylor runs 3 miles every weekday. After 5 weeks, they compare their total distances and find that Alex has run 100 miles, while Taylor has run 75 miles. They decide to run together for the next 3 weeks to reach a combined total of 250 miles. However, Alex decides to reduce their daily running by 1 mile per weekday, while Taylor increases their daily running by 2 miles per weekday. How many miles per weekday will Taylor need to run to ensure they reach their goal?  

Wrong answer: Taylor will need to run 6 miles per weekday.  
Explanation: I miscalculated the total distance they need to run in the next 3 weeks and incorrectly set up the equation for Taylor's running. I forgot to account for Alex's reduced running in the total.  

Error Keywords:  
- Misinterpretation of the problem  
- Incorrect equation setup  
- Arithmetic error  

Solution:  
Step 1: Calculate the total distance Alex and Taylor need to run in the next 3 weeks to reach 250 miles.  
- Total distance already run: 100 + 75 = 175 miles.  
- Remaining distance: 250 - 175 = 75 miles.  

Step 2: Determine Alex's running for the next 3 weeks.  
- Alex reduces their daily running by 1 mile per weekday, so they now run 4 - 1 = 3 miles per weekday.  
- Total running for Alex in 3 weeks: 3 miles/day × 5 days/week × 3 weeks = 45 miles.  

Step 3: Determine how much Taylor needs to run to cover the remaining distance.  
- Remaining distance after Alex's contribution: 75 - 45 = 30 miles.  
- Taylor runs 3 miles per weekday initially and increases by 2 miles per weekday, so Taylor needs to run 5 miles per weekday.  

Correct answer: Taylor will need to run **5 miles per weekday**.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Jasmine and Mia are sisters from Nairobi who love collecting signatures from authors. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Jasmine and Mia compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Jasmine has 36 signatures in her book, and Mia has 31. The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 5.0

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","Let’s carefully analyze and solve this problem step by step, reflecting on any errors and ensuring the solution is correct this time.

---

### Reflection on Previous Errors:
1. **Why the answer was incorrect:**
   - **Misinterpretation of the problem:** I likely misunderstood the changes in Jasmine's and Mia's weekly collection rates during the remaining 2 weeks. Specifically, I may have failed to properly account for Jasmine's reduced collection rate or Mia's increased collection rate.
   - **Incorrect equation setup:** I may have set up the equation incorrectly, leading to an inaccurate calculation of the number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week.
   - **Arithmetic error:** There may have been a mistake in calculating the total number of signatures needed or in solving the equation.

2. **Error Keywords:**
   - Misinterpretation of the problem
   - Incorrect equation setup
   - Arithmetic error

---

### Solving the Problem Step-by-Step:

#### Step 1: Calculate the total number of signatures needed during the remaining 2 weeks.
- Total goal: 145 signatures
- Signatures already collected: Jasmine (36) + Mia (31) = 67 signatures
- Remaining signatures needed: \( 145 - 67 = 78 \)

#### Step 2: Determine Jasmine's contribution during the remaining 2 weeks.
- Jasmine collects signatures only on weekends during the remaining 2 weeks. This reduces her weekly collection by 5 per week.
- Assume Jasmine's original weekly collection rate was \( x \). Since she collected 36 signatures in 6 weeks, her weekly rate is:
  \[
  x = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \text{ signatures per week.}
  \]
- Jasmine's reduced weekly collection rate is:
  \[
  6 - 5 = 1 \text{ signature per week.}
  \]
- Over 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect:
  \[
  1 \times 2 = 2 \text{ signatures.}
  \]

#### Step 3: Determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect.
- Remaining signatures after Jasmine's contribution:
  \[
  78 - 2 = 76 \text{ signatures.}
  \]
- Mia needs to collect these 76 signatures over 2 weeks. Let \( y \) represent the number of signatures Mia collects per week. Then:
  \[
  2y = 76
  \]
- Solve for \( y \):
  \[
  y = \frac{76}{2} = 38
  \]

#### Final Answer:
Mia will need to collect **38 signatures per week** to ensure they reach their goal.

Question: Alex and Taylor are friends who enjoy running. Over the summer, Alex runs 4 miles every weekday, while Taylor runs 3 miles every weekday. After 5 weeks, they compare their total distances and find that Alex has run 100 miles, while Taylor has run 75 miles. They decide to run together for the next 3 weeks to reach a combined total of 250 miles. However, Alex decides to reduce their daily running by 1 mile per weekday, while Taylor increases their daily running by 2 miles per weekday. How many miles per weekday will Taylor need to run to ensure they reach their goal?  

Wrong answer: Taylor will need to run 6 miles per weekday.  
Explanation: I miscalculated the total distance they need to run in the next 3 weeks and incorrectly set up the equation for Taylor's running. I forgot to account for Alex's reduced running in the total.  

Error Keywords:  
- Misinterpretation of the problem  
- Incorrect equation setup  
- Arithmetic error  

Solution:  
Step 1: Calculate the total distance Alex and Taylor need to run in the next 3 weeks to reach 250 miles.  
- Total distance already run: 100 + 75 = 175 miles.  
- Remaining distance: 250 - 175 = 75 miles.  

Step 2: Determine Alex's running for the next 3 weeks.  
- Alex reduces their daily running by 1 mile per weekday, so they now run 4 - 1 = 3 miles per weekday.  
- Total running for Alex in 3 weeks: 3 miles/day × 5 days/week × 3 weeks = 45 miles.  

Step 3: Determine how much Taylor needs to run to cover the remaining distance.  
- Remaining distance after Alex's contribution: 75 - 45 = 30 miles.  
- Taylor runs 3 miles per weekday initially and increases by 2 miles per weekday, so Taylor needs to run 5 miles per weekday.  

Correct answer: Taylor will need to run **5 miles per weekday**.  

Instructions:  
1. Carefully read the problem and identify the total goal, current progress, and remaining distance.  
2. Break the problem into parts: calculate each person's contribution separately.

However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,"We are tasked with determining how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week during the remaining 2 weeks of spring break to ensure that Jasmine and Mia reach a total of 145 signatures.

---

### Step 1: Determine the total number of signatures they currently have.
Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures. Together, they currently have:
\[
36 + 31 = 67 \text{ signatures.}
\]

---

### Step 2: Determine how many more signatures they need to reach their goal.
Their goal is 145 signatures. The number of additional signatures they need is:
\[
145 - 67 = 78 \text{ signatures.}
\]

---

### Step 3: Account for Jasmine's reduced collection rate.
Jasmine collects signatures only on weekends during the remaining 2 weeks. If her weekly collection is reduced by 5 signatures per week, we need to calculate her new weekly collection rate.

Let \( x \) represent Jasmine's original weekly collection rate. Since she collected for 6 weeks and has 36 signatures, her weekly collection rate is:
\[
x = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \text{ signatures per week.}
\]

Now, her reduced weekly collection rate is:
\[
6 - 5 = 1 \text{ signature per week.}
\]

Over the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect:
\[
1 \times 2 = 2 \text{ signatures.}
\]

---

### Step 4: Determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect.
The total number of additional signatures needed is 78. Jasmine will contribute 2 of these signatures, so Mia needs to collect:
\[
78 - 2 = 76 \text{ signatures.}
\]

Mia has 2 weeks to collect these 76 signatures. Let \( y \) represent the number of signatures Mia collects per week. Then:
\[
2y = 76
\]

Solve for \( y \):
\[
y = \frac{76}{2} = 38
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Mia needs to collect **38 signatures per week** during the remaining 2 weeks to ensure that she and Jasmine reach their goal of 145 signatures.",145.0,0,"Jasmine and Mia want to reach a total of 145 signatures by the end of their spring break. Let’s break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many signatures they already have.
Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures.  
So, the total number of signatures they currently have is:  
36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

### Step 2: Calculate how many more signatures they need to reach their goal.
Their goal is 145 signatures. They already have 67 signatures.  
The number of signatures they still need is:  
145 - 67 = 78 signatures.

### Step 3: Determine how many signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks.
Jasmine collects fewer signatures now because she can only collect on weekends. Her weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week.  
Let’s assume Jasmine was collecting **x** signatures per week before. Since her weekly collection is reduced by 5, she now collects **x - 5** signatures per week.

However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?
Your initial answer was: Jasmine and Mia want to reach a total of 145 signatures by the end of their spring break. Let’s break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many signatures they already have.
Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures.  
So, the total number of signatures they currently have is:  
36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

### Step 2: Calculate how many more signatures they need to reach their goal.

### Correct Solution (Step-by-Step):

#### Step 1: Determine how many signatures Jasmine and Mia already have.
Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures.  
The total number of signatures they currently have is:  
\[
36 + 31 = 67 \text{ signatures.}
\]

#### Step 2: Calculate how many more signatures they need to reach their goal.
Their goal is 145 signatures. They already have 67 signatures.  
The number of signatures they still need is:  
\[
145 - 67 = 78 \text{ signatures.}
\]

#### Step 3: Determine how many signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks.
Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week.  
Assume Jasmine was collecting **10 signatures per week** before (a reasonable assumption based on the problem).  
Now, Jasmine collects:  
\[
10 - 5 = 5 \text{ signatures per week.}
\]  
Over 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect:  
\[
5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ signatures.}
\]

#### Step 4: Determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect.
The total number of signatures they still need is 78. Jasmine will contribute 10 of these signatures.  
This means Mia needs to collect:  
\[
78 - 10 = 68 \text{ signatures.}
\]

#### Step 5: Calculate Mia's required weekly collection rate.
Mia has 2 weeks to collect 68 signatures. Her weekly collection rate must be:  
\[
\frac{68}{2} = 34 \text{ signatures per week.}
\]

#### Final Answer:
Mia needs to collect **34 signatures per week** to ensure they reach their goal.

They want to bake a total of 150 baked goods by the end of the 5th week. However, Alex decides to bake 5 fewer cookies per week for the next 2 weeks, while Taylor decides to increase their cupcake production. How many cupcakes will Taylor need to bake per week to meet their goal?  

Wrong answer: Taylor needs to bake 20 cupcakes per week.  
Explanation of the mistake: I miscalculated the total number of baked goods already made and incorrectly set up the equation for the remaining baked goods needed.  

---  

[Example Output]  

**Explanation:**  
I miscalculated the total number of baked goods already made by Alex and Taylor. I also incorrectly set up the equation for the remaining baked goods needed to reach the goal. Specifically, I forgot to account for Alex’s reduced cookie production over the next 2 weeks, which led to an incorrect calculation of how many cupcakes Taylor needed to bake.  

**Error Keywords:**  
- Misinterpretation of word problem  
- Incorrect equation setup  
- Arithmetic error  

**Solution:**  
1. First, calculate the total number of baked goods already made:  
   - Alex baked 45 cookies, and Taylor baked 30 cupcakes.  
   - Total baked goods so far = 45 + 30 = 75.  

2. Determine how many baked goods are still needed to reach the goal:  
   - Goal = 150 baked goods.  
   - Remaining baked goods needed = 150 - 75 = 75.  

3. Account for Alex’s reduced cookie production:  
   - Alex bakes 5 fewer cookies per week for the next 2 weeks.  
   - Weekly cookie production = 45 ÷ 3 = 15 cookies per week.  
   - Reduced weekly production = 15 - 5 = 10 cookies per week.  
   - Total cookies Alex will bake in the next 2 weeks = 10 × 2 = 20 cookies.  

4. Calculate how many cupcakes Taylor needs to bake:  
   - Remaining baked goods needed = 75.  
   - Alex will bake 20 cookies in the next 2 weeks.  
   - Remaining baked goods for Taylor = 75 - 20 = 55.  
   - Taylor needs to bake 55 cupcakes over 2 weeks.  
   - Weekly cupcake production = 55 ÷ 2 = 27.5 cupcakes per week.  

5. Since Taylor cannot bake half a cupcake, they will need to bake **28 cupcakes per week** to meet the goal.  

**Instructions:**  
1. Carefully read the problem and identify the total goal and the current progress.  
2. Break the problem into smaller parts:  
   - Calculate the total already completed.  
   - Determine the remaining amount needed.  
3. Account for any changes in production rates or constraints for each person.  
4. Set up an equation to represent the remaining work and solve for the unknown variable.  
5. Double-check your calculations and ensure the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.  

**Advice:**  
- Always double-check the total progress made so far before calculating the remaining work.  
- Pay close attention to changes in rates or constraints mentioned in the problem.  
- Clearly define variables and set up equations carefully to avoid misinterpretation.  
- Verify your solution by plugging it back into the problem to ensure it meets the goal.

**Solution:**  

1. **Calculate the total number of signatures already collected:**  
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.  
   - Mia has 31 signatures.  
   - Total signatures so far = 36 + 31 = **67 signatures**.  

2. **Determine how many signatures are still needed to reach the goal:**  
   - Goal = 145 signatures.  
   - Remaining signatures needed = 145 - 67 = **78 signatures**.  

3. **Account for Jasmine’s reduced collection rate:**  
   - Jasmine collects 5 fewer signatures per week during the remaining 2 weeks.  
   - Jasmine’s original weekly collection rate = 36 ÷ 6 = 6 signatures per week.  
   - Reduced weekly collection rate = 6 - 5 = **1 signature per week**.  
   - Total signatures Jasmine will collect in the next 2 weeks = 1 × 2 = **2 signatures**.  

4. **Calculate how many signatures Mia needs to collect:**  
   - Remaining signatures needed = 78.  
   - Jasmine will collect 2 more signatures.  
   - Remaining signatures for Mia = 78 - 2 = **76 signatures**.

[Example Input]  
Question: Alex and Taylor are planning a fundraiser. Alex bakes cookies and Taylor bakes cupcakes. Over the first 3 weeks, Alex bakes 45 cookies, and Taylor bakes 30 cupcakes. They want to bake a total of 150 baked goods by the end of the 5th week. However, Alex decides to bake 5 fewer cookies per week for the next 2 weeks, while Taylor decides to increase their cupcake production. How many cupcakes will Taylor need to bake per week to meet their goal?  

Wrong answer: Taylor needs to bake 20 cupcakes per week.  
Explanation of the mistake: I miscalculated the total number of baked goods already made and incorrectly set up the equation for the remaining baked goods needed.  

---  

[Example Output]  

**Explanation:**  
I miscalculated the total number of baked goods already made by Alex and Taylor. I also incorrectly set up the equation for the remaining baked goods needed to reach the goal. Specifically, I forgot to account for Alex’s reduced cookie production over the next 2 weeks, which led to an incorrect calculation of how many cupcakes Taylor needed to bake.  

**Error Keywords:**  
- Misinterpretation of word problem  
- Incorrect equation setup  
- Arithmetic error  

**Solution:**  
1. First, calculate the total number of baked goods already made:  
   - Alex baked 45 cookies, and Taylor baked 30 cupcakes.  
   - Total baked goods so far = 45 + 30 = 75.  

2. Determine how many baked goods are still needed to reach the goal:  
   - Goal = 150 baked goods.  
   - Remaining baked goods needed = 150 - 75 = 75.  

3. Account for Alex’s reduced cookie production:  
   - Alex bakes 5 fewer cookies per week for the next 2 weeks.  
   - Weekly cookie production = 45 ÷ 3 = 15 cookies per week.  
   - Reduced weekly production = 15 - 5 = 10 cookies per week.  
   - Total cookies Alex will bake in the next 2 weeks = 10 × 2 = 20 cookies.  

4. Calculate how many cupcakes Taylor needs to bake:  
   - Remaining baked goods needed = 75.  
   - Alex will bake 20 cookies in the next 2 weeks.  
   - Remaining baked goods for Taylor = 75 - 20 = 55.  
   - Taylor needs to bake 55 cupcakes over 2 weeks.  
   - Weekly cupcake production = 55 ÷ 2 = 27.5 cupcakes per week.  

5. Since Taylor cannot bake half a cupcake, they will need to bake **28 cupcakes per week** to meet the goal.  

**Instructions:**  
1. Carefully read the problem and identify the total goal and the current progress.  
2. Break the problem into smaller parts:  
   - Calculate the total already completed.  
   - Determine the remaining amount needed.  
3. Account for any changes in production rates or constraints for each person.  
4. Set up an equation to represent the remaining work and solve for the unknown variable.  
5. Double-check your calculations and ensure the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.  

**Advice:**  
- Always double-check the total progress made so far before calculating the remaining work.  
- Pay close attention to changes in rates or constraints mentioned in the problem.  
- Clearly define variables and set up equations carefully to avoid misinterpretation.  
- Verify your solution by plugging it back into the problem to ensure it meets the goal.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Leon wants to make different sized ice cubes with 312 ounces of water. He can make giant cubes that use 12 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 5 ounces, small cubes that use 1/2 of a ounce, and tiny cubes that are half the size of small cubes. He makes 48 total ice cubes, including 10 giant cubes, 14 small cubes, 12 medium cubes, and some tiny cubes. How many ounces of water does Leon have left?",122.0,"To solve this problem, we will calculate the total amount of water Leon uses for the ice cubes he makes and subtract it from the 312 ounces of water he starts with.

### Step 1: Calculate the water used for each type of ice cube
1. **Giant cubes**: Each giant cube uses 12 ounces of water, and Leon makes 10 giant cubes.
   \[
   \text{Water used for giant cubes} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \, \text{ounces}.
   \]

2. **Medium cubes**: Each medium cube uses 5 ounces of water, and Leon makes 12 medium cubes.
   \[
   \text{Water used for medium cubes} = 12 \times 5 = 60 \, \text{ounces}.
   \]

3. **Small cubes**: Each small cube uses \( \frac{1}{2} \) ounce of water, and Leon makes 14 small cubes.
   \[
   \text{Water used for small cubes} = 14 \times \frac{1}{2} = 7 \, \text{ounces}.
   \]

4. **Tiny cubes**: Each tiny cube is half the size of a small cube, so each tiny cube uses \( \frac{1}{4} \) ounce of water. Let \( x \) represent the number of tiny cubes Leon makes. The water used for the tiny cubes is:
   \[
   \text{Water used for tiny cubes} = x \times \frac{1}{4}.
   \]

### Step 2: Total number of ice cubes
Leon makes a total of 48 ice cubes, including 10 giant cubes, 12 medium cubes, 14 small cubes, and \( x \) tiny cubes. The total number of cubes is:
\[
10 + 12 + 14 + x = 48.
\]
Simplify to solve for \( x \):
\[
36 + x = 48 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 48 - 36 = 12.
\]
So, Leon makes 12 tiny cubes.

### Step 3: Calculate the water used for tiny cubes
Each tiny cube uses \( \frac{1}{4} \) ounce of water, and Leon makes 12 tiny cubes:
\[
\text{Water used for tiny cubes} = 12 \times \frac{1}{4} = 3 \, \text{ounces}.
\]

### Step 4: Total water used
Now, add up the water used for all the ice cubes:
\[
\text{Total water used} = 120 + 60 + 7 + 3 = 190 \, \text{ounces}.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the water left
Leon starts with 312 ounces of water. The amount of water left is:
\[
\text{Water left} = 312 - 190 = 122 \, \text{ounces}.
\]

### Final Answer:
Leon has **122 ounces** of water left.",122.0,1,"Leon starts with 312 ounces of water. He makes 48 total ice cubes, including 10 giant cubes, 14 small cubes, 12 medium cubes, and some tiny cubes. We need to calculate how much water he uses for the cubes and how much water he has left.

### Step 1: Calculate the water used for the giant cubes.
Each giant cube uses 12 ounces of water. Leon makes 10 giant cubes.
So, the water used for the giant cubes is:
\[
10 \times 12 = 120 \, \text{ounces}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the water used for the medium cubes.
Each medium cube uses 5 ounces of water. Leon makes 12 medium cubes.
So, the water used for the medium cubes is:
\[
12 \times 5 = 60 \, \text{ounces}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the water used for the small cubes.
Each small cube uses \( \frac{1}{2} \) (0.5) ounces of water. Leon makes 14 small cubes.
So, the water used for the small cubes is:
\[
14 \times 0.5 = 7 \, \text{ounces}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the water used for the tiny cubes.
Tiny cubes are half the size of small cubes, so each tiny cube uses \( \frac{1}{4} \) (0.25) ounces of water. Leon makes a total of 48 cubes, and we already know he made 10 giant cubes, 12 medium cubes, and 14 small cubes. The remaining cubes must be tiny cubes:
\[
48 - (10 + 12 + 14) = 12 \, \text{tiny cubes}.
\]
Each tiny cube uses 0.25 ounces of water, so the water used for the tiny cubes is:
\[
12 \times 0.25 = 3 \, \text{ounces}.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total water used.
Now, we add up the water used for all the cubes:
\[
120 \, (\text{giant}) + 60 \, (\text{medium}) + 7 \, (\text{small}) + 3 \, (\text{tiny}) = 190 \, \text{ounces}.
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the water Leon has left.
Leon started with 312 ounces of water. He used 190 ounces for the cubes. The remaining water is:
\[
312 - 190 = 122 \, \text{ounces}.

What percentage of the students like to play video games if the number of the students that like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football?",5.0,"We are tasked with finding the percentage of students in a class of 160 who like to play video games. Let's break this problem into steps.

---

### Step 1: Define the known quantities
- Total number of students = **160**
- Students who like to hike = **69**
- Students who like to play chess = **8**
- Students who like to swim = **13**
- Students who like to play football = **13**
- Students who like to bake = **3 less than four times the number of students who like to play football**.

Let the number of students who like to bake be \( B \). From the problem, we know:
\[
B = 4 \times 13 - 3 = 52 - 3 = 49
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of students accounted for so far
Add up the students who like hiking, chess, swimming, football, and baking:
\[
69 + 8 + 13 + 13 + 49 = 152
\]

---

### Step 3: Find the number of students who like to play video games
The total number of students is 160, so the number of students who like to play video games is:
\[
160 - 152 = 8
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage of students who like to play video games
The percentage of students who like to play video games is:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of students who like video games}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{8}{160} \right) \times 100 = 5\%
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The percentage of students who like to play video games is **5%**.",5.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

We are given:
- The total number of students is 160.
- 69 students like to hike.
- 8 students like to play chess.
- 13 students like to swim.
- 13 students like to play football.
- The rest of the students like to either play video games or bake.
- The number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number of students who like to play football.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of students accounted for so far.
The students who like hiking, chess, swimming, and football are:
\[
69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103
\]
So, 103 students are accounted for.

### Step 2: Find the number of students who like either video games or baking.
The total number of students is 160, and 103 are already accounted for. Therefore, the number of students who like either video games or baking is:
\[
160 - 103 = 57
\]

### Step 3: Express the number of students who like baking in terms of those who like football.
We are told that the number of students who like baking is 3 less than four times the number of students who like football. Since 13 students like football, the number of students who like baking is:
\[
4 \times 13 - 3 = 52 - 3 = 49
\]
So, 49 students like baking.

### Step 4: Find the number of students who like video games.
The total number of students who like either video games or baking is 57. Since 49 students like baking, the number of students who like video games is:
\[
57 - 49 = 8
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the percentage of students who like video games.
The percentage of students who like video games is:
\[
\left( \frac{8}{160} \right) \times 100 = 5\%

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Oliver is raising money for a 2-day workshop. Each day costs ₣100 for hotel, ₣20 for food, and ₣10 for transportation. Oliver only has ₣85. His friends have chipped in and will cover the cost of all the food for the workshop. Oliver has also applied for help from the local charity, which has decided to cover 1/10 of the remaining cost of the workshop. How much money is Oliver still missing?",113.0,"Let's break this problem into steps to determine how much money Oliver is still missing.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the workshop.
The workshop lasts 2 days, and the daily costs are as follows:
- Hotel: ₣100 per day
- Food: ₣20 per day
- Transportation: ₣10 per day

The total cost for **2 days** is:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 2 \times (\text{Hotel} + \text{Food} + \text{Transportation})
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 2 \times (₣100 + ₣20 + ₣10) = 2 \times ₣130 = ₣260
\]

So, the total cost of the workshop is **₣260**.

---

### Step 2: Subtract the cost of food covered by Oliver's friends.
Oliver's friends are covering all the food costs. The total food cost for 2 days is:
\[
\text{Food cost} = 2 \times ₣20 = ₣40
\]

This means Oliver does not need to pay the ₣40 for food. The remaining cost is:
\[
\text{Remaining cost} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Food cost}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining cost} = ₣260 - ₣40 = ₣220
\]

So, the remaining cost after the food is covered is **₣220**.

---

### Step 3: Subtract the contribution from the local charity.
The local charity will cover **1/10** of the remaining cost. This contribution is:
\[
\text{Charity contribution} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Remaining cost}
\]
\[
\text{Charity contribution} = \frac{1}{10} \times ₣220 = ₣22
\]

After the charity's contribution, the new remaining cost is:
\[
\text{New remaining cost} = \text{Remaining cost} - \text{Charity contribution}
\]
\[
\text{New remaining cost} = ₣220 - ₣22 = ₣198
\]

So, the remaining cost after the charity's contribution is **₣198**.

---

### Step 4: Subtract the money Oliver already has.
Oliver already has ₣85. Subtract this from the remaining cost:
\[
\text{Money still missing} = \text{New remaining cost} - \text{Oliver's money}
\]
\[
\text{Money still missing} = ₣198 - ₣85 = ₣113
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Oliver is still missing **₣113**.",113.0,1,"Oliver is raising money for a 2-day workshop. Let's calculate the total cost step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the hotel for 2 days:**
   Each day costs ₣100 for the hotel. For 2 days, the total hotel cost is:
   \[
   100 \times 2 = ₣200
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of food for 2 days:**
   Each day costs ₣20 for food. For 2 days, the total food cost is:
   \[
   20 \times 2 = ₣40
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of transportation for 2 days:**
   Each day costs ₣10 for transportation. For 2 days, the total transportation cost is:
   \[
   10 \times 2 = ₣20
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the workshop:**
   Adding up the costs for the hotel, food, and transportation:
   \[
   200 + 40 + 20 = ₣260
   \]

5. **Subtract the cost of food covered by Oliver's friends:**
   Oliver's friends will cover the entire food cost of ₣40. So, the remaining cost is:
   \[
   260 - 40 = ₣220
   \]

6. **Calculate the contribution from the local charity:**
   The local charity will cover 1/10 of the remaining cost of ₣220. This is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{10} \times 220 = ₣22
   \]

7. **Subtract the charity's contribution from the remaining cost:**
   After the charity's contribution, the remaining cost is:
   \[
   220 - 22 = ₣198
   \]

8. **Subtract the money Oliver already has:**
   Oliver already has ₣85. Subtracting this from the remaining cost:
   \[
   198 - 85 = ₣113

The bakery has a promotion that if one buys 7 bagels or more, they get a 20% discount on bagels. How much more do 4 loaves of bread cost than 8 bagels?",12.0,"We will solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the cost of a bagel
The cost of a loaf of bread is €5. A bagel costs one-fourth of a loaf of bread. Therefore:

\[
\text{Cost of a bagel} = \frac{1}{4} \times 5 = 1.25 \, \text{€}.
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of 8 bagels without the discount
The cost of 1 bagel is €1.25. The cost of 8 bagels without any discount is:

\[
\text{Cost of 8 bagels} = 8 \times 1.25 = 10 \, \text{€}.
\]

---

### Step 3: Apply the 20% discount for buying 7 or more bagels
Since the bakery offers a 20% discount on bagels if 7 or more are purchased, the discount applies to the 8 bagels. The discount is calculated as:

\[
\text{Discount} = 20\% \times 10 = 0.2 \times 10 = 2 \, \text{€}.
\]

The discounted cost of 8 bagels is:

\[
\text{Discounted cost of 8 bagels} = 10 - 2 = 8 \, \text{€}.

---

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of 4 loaves of bread
The cost of 1 loaf of bread is €5. The cost of 4 loaves of bread is:

\[
\text{Cost of 4 loaves of bread} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \, \text{€}.
\]

---

### Step 5: Find the difference in cost
The cost of 4 loaves of bread is €20, and the discounted cost of 8 bagels is €8. The difference in cost is:

\[
\text{Difference} = 20 - 8 = 12 \, \text{€}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The 4 loaves of bread cost **€12 more** than 8 bagels.",8.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Cost of a loaf of bread**:  
   The cost of a loaf of bread is €5.

2. **Cost of a bagel**:  
   The cost of a bagel is one-fourth of the cost of a loaf of bread.  
   So, the cost of a bagel is €5 / 4 = €1.25.

3. **Cost of 4 loaves of bread**:  
   Each loaf costs €5, and there are 4 loaves.  
   So, the total cost of 4 loaves is 4 * €5 = €20.

4. **Cost of 8 bagels without discount**:  
   Each bagel costs €1.25, and there are 8 bagels.  
   So, the total cost of 8 bagels without discount is 8 * €1.25 = €10.

5. **Discount on bagels**:  
   Since the bakery offers a 20% discount on bagels if 7 or more are purchased, the discount applies here.  
   The discount is 20% of €10.  
   Discount = 20% * €10 = 0.2 * €10 = €2.

6. **Cost of 8 bagels with discount**:  
   The cost of 8 bagels after the discount is €10 - €2 = €8.

7. **Difference in cost**:  
   The cost of 4 loaves of bread is €20.  
   The cost of 8 bagels (with the discount) is €8.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Elena and Jamal went to a construction supply store. Jamal is a member, but Elena is not. Elena has $98.39 and wants to buy 15 anchors from a bin at the store. She also needs 9 nails, each costing $0.61. Each anchor costs $0.26. Additionally, Elena picks up 10 gallons of paint. Jamal starts with $80 and wants 10 gallons of paint, each priced at $7.0, and 3 carpenter pencils, each costing $2. The store offers a 10% discount on paint for members. How much more money does Elena have left than Jamal after they leave the store?",8.0,"We will calculate the total cost for both Elena and Jamal step by step, and then determine how much more money Elena has left than Jamal after their purchases.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate Elena's total cost**
1. **Cost of 15 anchors**:
   Each anchor costs $0.26. For 15 anchors:
   \[
   15 \times 0.26 = 3.90 \, \text{(dollars)}.
   \]

2. **Cost of 9 nails**:
   Each nail costs $0.61. For 9 nails:
   \[
   9 \times 0.61 = 5.49 \, \text{(dollars)}.
   \]

3. **Cost of 10 gallons of paint**:
   Each gallon of paint costs $7.00. For 10 gallons:
   \[
   10 \times 7.00 = 70.00 \, \text{(dollars)}.
   \]

4. **Total cost for Elena**:
   Add the costs of anchors, nails, and paint:
   \[
   3.90 + 5.49 + 70.00 = 79.39 \, \text{(dollars)}.
   \]

5. **Money left for Elena**:
   Elena starts with $98.39. After spending $79.39:
   \[
   98.39 - 79.39 = 19.00 \, \text{(dollars)}.
   \]

---

### **Step 2: Calculate Jamal's total cost**
1. **Cost of 10 gallons of paint (with 10% discount)**:
   Each gallon of paint costs $7.00. For 10 gallons:
   \[
   10 \times 7.00 = 70.00 \, \text{(dollars)}.
   \]
   Jamal gets a 10% discount because he is a member:
   \[
   70.00 \times 0.10 = 7.00 \, \text{(discount)}.
   \]
   The discounted cost of the paint is:
   \[
   70.00 - 7.00 = 63.00 \, \text{(dollars)}.
   \]

2. **Cost of 3 carpenter pencils**:
   Each pencil costs $2.00. For 3 pencils:
   \[
   3 \times 2.00 = 6.00 \, \text{(dollars)}.
   \]

3. **Total cost for Jamal**:
   Add the costs of paint and pencils:
   \[
   63.00 + 6.00 = 69.00 \, \text{(dollars)}.
   \]

4. **Money left for Jamal**:
   Jamal starts with $80. After spending $69.00:
   \[
   80.00 - 69.00 = 11.00 \, \text{(dollars)}.
   \]

---

### **Step 3: Compare the money left**
Elena has $19.00 left, and Jamal has $11.00 left. The difference is:
\[
19.00 - 11.00 = 8.00 \, \text{(dollars)}.
\]

---

### **Final Answer**:
Elena has **$8.00 more** than Jamal after their purchases.",8.0,1,"### Step 1: Calculate Elena's total expenses.
Elena wants to buy:
- **15 anchors**, each costing $0.26.
  - Total cost for anchors = \( 15 \times 0.26 = 3.90 \).
- **9 nails**, each costing $0.61.
  - Total cost for nails = \( 9 \times 0.61 = 5.49 \).
- **10 gallons of paint**, each costing $7.00.
  - Total cost for paint = \( 10 \times 7.00 = 70.00 \).

Now, add up all of Elena's expenses:
\[
3.90 + 5.49 + 70.00 = 79.39
\]

Elena's total expenses are **$79.39**.

### Step 2: Calculate how much money Elena has left.
Elena starts with **$98.39**. After spending $79.39, the amount of money she has left is:
\[
98.39 - 79.39 = 19.00
\]

Elena has **$19.00** left.

---

### Step 3: Calculate Jamal's total expenses.
Jamal wants to buy:
- **10 gallons of paint**, each priced at $7.00. Since Jamal is a member, he gets a 10% discount on paint.
  - Discount on paint = \( 10\% \times 7.00 = 0.70 \) per gallon.
  - Discounted price per gallon = \( 7.00 - 0.70 = 6.30 \).
  - Total cost for paint = \( 10 \times 6.30 = 63.00 \).
- **3 carpenter pencils**, each costing $2.00.
  - Total cost for pencils = \( 3 \times 2.00 = 6.00 \).

Now, add up all of Jamal's expenses:
\[
63.00 + 6.00 = 69.00
\]

Jamal's total expenses are **$69.00**.

### Step 4: Calculate how much money Jamal has left.
Jamal starts with **$80.00**. After spending $69.00, the amount of money he has left is:
\[
80.00 - 69.00 = 11.00
\]

Jamal has **$11.00** left.

---

### Step 5: Compare how much money Elena has left with how much Jamal has left.
Elena has **$19.00** left, and Jamal has **$11.00** left. The difference is:
\[
19.00 - 11.00 = 8.00
\]

After 2 days, DeShawn decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half. How many days will it take for the cake to be fully eaten?",4.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine how much each person eats per day.
- **Arash** eats 5 pieces per day.
- **Ava** eats twice as much as Arash:
  \[
  \text{Ava's daily consumption} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pieces per day.}
  \]
- **DeShawn** eats twice as much as Ava:
  \[
  \text{DeShawn's daily consumption} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ pieces per day.}
  \]

So, the total daily consumption for the first 2 days is:
\[
\text{Total daily consumption} = 5 + 10 + 20 = 35 \text{ pieces per day.}
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate how much cake is eaten in the first 2 days.
In 2 days, the total amount of cake eaten is:
\[
\text{Cake eaten in 2 days} = 35 \times 2 = 70 \text{ pieces.}
\]

After 2 days, the remaining cake is:
\[
\text{Remaining cake} = 120 - 70 = 50 \text{ pieces.}
\]

---

### Step 3: Adjust DeShawn's consumption after 2 days.
After 2 days, DeShawn goes on a diet and cuts his consumption by half. His new daily consumption is:
\[
\text{DeShawn's new daily consumption} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ pieces per day.}
\]

Now, the total daily consumption for all three people becomes:
\[
\text{New total daily consumption} = 5 + 10 + 10 = 25 \text{ pieces per day.}
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate how many more days it takes to finish the cake.
The remaining cake is 50 pieces, and the group eats 25 pieces per day. The number of days required to finish the remaining cake is:
\[
\text{Days to finish the cake} = \frac{50}{25} = 2 \text{ days.}
\]

---

### Step 5: Add the first 2 days to the additional days.
The total time to finish the cake is:
\[
\text{Total days} = 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ days.}
\]

---

### Final Answer:
It will take **4 days** for the cake to be fully eaten.",4.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The giant cake has 120 pieces.

### Step 1: Determine how many pieces each person eats per day.
- Arash eats 5 pieces a day.
- Ava eats twice as much as Arash, so Ava eats \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) pieces a day.
- DeShawn eats two times as much as Ava, so DeShawn eats \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) pieces a day.

### Step 2: Calculate how many pieces they eat together in 1 day.
In 1 day, the total number of pieces eaten by all three is:
\[
5 + 10 + 20 = 35 \text{ pieces.}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how many pieces they eat in the first 2 days.
In 2 days, they eat:
\[
35 \times 2 = 70 \text{ pieces.}
\]
After 2 days, the remaining number of pieces is:
\[
120 - 70 = 50 \text{ pieces.}
\]

### Step 4: Adjust DeShawn's consumption after 2 days.
After 2 days, DeShawn goes on a diet and cuts his consumption by half. This means DeShawn now eats:
\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ pieces a day.}
\]

Now, the total number of pieces eaten per day by all three is:
\[
5 + 10 + 10 = 25 \text{ pieces.}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate how many more days it will take to finish the remaining cake.
There are 50 pieces left, and they eat 25 pieces per day. The number of days needed to finish the cake is:
\[
\frac{50}{25} = 2 \text{ days.}
\]

### Step 6: Add the initial 2 days to the additional days.
The total number of days it takes to fully eat the cake is:
\[
2 + 2 = 4 \text{ days.}

The crayon box has 12 different colors of crayon, and the sticker book has 6 pages, each with 12 stickers. The tower of stacking rings has 29 multicolored rings on it. Gabrielle recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of items for her nephew up to 320. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?",63.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bouncy balls came in the tube. Let's break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of toys Gabrielle already had before buying the bouncy balls.

#### 1.1: Building blocks
The bag of building blocks contains **43 blocks**.

#### 1.2: Stuffed animals
The bin of stuffed animals contains **5 stuffed animals**.

#### 1.3: Action figures
The number of action figures is **twice the number of blocks and stuffed animals combined**. First, calculate the total number of blocks and stuffed animals:
\[
43 + 5 = 48
\]
The number of action figures is:
\[
2 \times 48 = 96
\]

#### 1.4: Crayons
The crayon box contains **12 crayons**.

#### 1.5: Stickers
The sticker book has **6 pages**, each with **12 stickers**. The total number of stickers is:
\[
6 \times 12 = 72
\]

#### 1.6: Stacking rings
The tower of stacking rings has **29 rings**.

---

### Step 2: Add up the total number of toys before the bouncy balls.
Now, sum up all the toys:
\[
43 \, (\text{blocks}) + 5 \, (\text{stuffed animals}) + 96 \, (\text{action figures}) + 12 \, (\text{crayons}) + 72 \, (\text{stickers}) + 29 \, (\text{stacking rings})

Due to the pandemic, 20 patients are admitted into the care facility each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks.",530.0,"To solve this problem, we will calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks, step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the number of rooms occupied and out of service initially.
The care facility has a total capacity of **1900 rooms**. We are told that:
- **1/4 of the rooms are occupied**.
- **1/4 of the rooms are out of service**.

#### Calculate the number of occupied rooms:
\[
\text{Occupied rooms} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475
\]

#### Calculate the number of out-of-service rooms:
\[
\text{Out-of-service rooms} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475
\]

---

### Step 2: Determine the number of unoccupied rooms initially.
The total number of unoccupied rooms is the remaining rooms after subtracting the occupied and out-of-service rooms from the total capacity.

\[
\text{Unoccupied rooms initially} = \text{Total rooms} - (\text{Occupied rooms} + \text{Out-of-service rooms})
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Unoccupied rooms initially} = 1900 - (475 + 475) = 1900 - 950 = 950
\]

---

### Step 3: Account for the daily admissions of patients.
We are told that **20 patients are admitted into the care facility each day**. Over a period of **3 weeks**, the total number of days is:

\[
\text{Total days} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \, \text{days}
\]

The total number of patients admitted over 21 days is:
\[
\text{Total patients admitted} = 20 \times 21 = 420
\]

---

### Step 4: Update the number of unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks.
Each new patient occupies one room, so the number of unoccupied rooms decreases by the number of patients admitted. The updated number of unoccupied rooms is:

\[
\text{Unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks} = \text{Unoccupied rooms initially} - \text{Total patients admitted}
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks} = 950 - 420 = 530
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks is:
\[
\boxed{530}
\]",530.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Understand the problem**:  
   The care facility has a total of 1900 rooms.  
   - 1/4 of the rooms are occupied.  
   - 1/4 of the rooms are out of service.  
   - 20 patients are admitted each day.  
   - We need to calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks.

2. **Calculate the number of occupied rooms**:  
   Since 1/4 of the rooms are occupied, the number of occupied rooms is:  
   \( 1900 \times \frac{1}{4} = 475 \).

3. **Calculate the number of out-of-service rooms**:  
   Since 1/4 of the rooms are out of service, the number of out-of-service rooms is:  
   \( 1900 \times \frac{1}{4} = 475 \).

4. **Calculate the number of available rooms**:  
   The available rooms are the total rooms minus the occupied and out-of-service rooms:  
   \( 1900 - 475 - 475 = 950 \).  
   So, there are 950 available rooms initially.

5. **Determine the number of patients admitted in 3 weeks**:  
   There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks have \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days.  
   Since 20 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted in 3 weeks is:  
   \( 20 \times 21 = 420 \).

6. **Calculate the total number of occupied rooms after 3 weeks**:  
   Initially, there were 475 occupied rooms. After admitting 420 more patients, the total number of occupied rooms is:  
   \( 475 + 420 = 895 \).

7. **Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms**:  
   The total number of unoccupied rooms is the available rooms minus the newly occupied rooms:  
   \( 950 - 420 = 530 \).

These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away tournament. Half of the swimmers are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the tournament?",66.0,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the number of swimmers.
Mrs. Garcia's class has **120 students**, and **50%** of the class are swimmers.  
\[
\text{Number of swimmers} = 50\% \times 120 = 0.5 \times 120 = 60
\]

---

### Step 2: Determine the number of students who are not swimmers.
The remaining students are not swimmers:
\[
\text{Non-swimmers} = 120 - 60 = 60
\]

---

### Step 3: Determine the number of choir members or dancers.
Out of the **60 non-swimmers**, **45%** are choir members or dancers:
\[
\text{Choir members or dancers} = 45\% \times 60 = 0.45 \times 60 = 27
\]

---

### Step 4: Total number of students in the three groups.
The three groups of students leaving early are:
1. Swimmers,
2. Choir members, and
3. Dancers.

The total number of students in these groups is:
\[
\text{Total students in groups} = \text{Swimmers} + \text{Choir members or dancers} = 60 + 27 = 87
\]

---

### Step 5: Adjust for absent swimmers.
Half of the swimmers are absent due to being sick.  
\[
\text{Absent swimmers} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30
\]
Thus, the number of swimmers leaving early is:
\[
\text{Swimmers leaving early} = 60 - 30 = 30

Now, the total number of students leaving early is:
\[
\text{Total students leaving early} = \text{Swimmers leaving early} + \text{Choir members or dancers} = 30 + 27 = 57
\]

---

### Step 6: Add cheerleaders.
Each of the three groups (swimmers, choir members, and dancers) will be accompanied by **3 cheerleaders**.  
\[
\text{Total cheerleaders} = 3 \times 3 = 9
\]

Adding the cheerleaders to the total:
\[
\text{Total people leaving early} = \text{Students leaving early} + \text{Cheerleaders} = 57 + 9 = 66
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The total number of people leaving early to the tournament is:
\[
\boxed{66}
\]",66.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the number of swimmers in the class:**
   - 50% of the class are swimmers.
   - The total number of students in the class is 120.
   - So, the number of swimmers is \( 50\% \times 120 = 0.5 \times 120 = 60 \).

2. **Determine the number of swimmers who are absent:**
   - Half of the swimmers are absent due to being sick.
   - So, the number of swimmers who are absent is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \).
   - Therefore, the number of swimmers who are present is \( 60 - 30 = 30 \).

3. **Determine the number of students who are choir members or dancers:**
   - Out of the remaining class (those who are not swimmers), 45% are choir members or dancers.
   - The number of students who are not swimmers is \( 120 - 60 = 60 \).
   - So, the number of choir members or dancers is \( 45\% \times 60 = 0.45 \times 60 = 27 \).

4. **Add the groups of students leaving early:**
   - The groups leaving early are the present swimmers and the choir members or dancers.
   - The total number of students leaving early is \( 30 + 27 = 57 \).

5. **Account for the cheerleaders accompanying the groups:**
   - There are 3 cheerleaders accompanying each group.
   - There are 2 groups (swimmers and choir members/dancers).
   - So, the total number of cheerleaders is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \).

6. **Calculate the total number of people leaving early:**
   - The total number of people leaving early is the students plus the cheerleaders.
   - So, the total is \( 57 + 6 = 63 \).

---

### Correct Solution (Step-by-Step)

#### Step 1: Calculate the number of swimmers.
- Mrs. Garcia's class has 120 students.
- 50% of the class are swimmers:  
  \( 50\% \times 120 = 0.5 \times 120 = 60 \) swimmers.

#### Step 2: Account for the swimmers who are absent.
- Half of the swimmers are absent due to sickness:  
  \( \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \) swimmers are absent.  
  Therefore, the number of swimmers leaving early is:  
  \( 60 - 30 = 30 \) swimmers.

#### Step 3: Calculate the number of choir members and dancers.
- The remaining students after accounting for swimmers:  
  \( 120 - 60 = 60 \) students.
- 45% of the remaining students are choir members or dancers:  
  \( 45\% \times 60 = 0.45 \times 60 = 27 \) choir members and dancers.

#### Step 4: Add the cheerleaders accompanying each group.
- There are 3 cheerleaders accompanying each of the 3 groups (swimmers, choir members, and dancers):  
  \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) cheerleaders.

#### Step 5: Calculate the total number of people leaving early.
- Total students leaving early:  
  \( 30 \) swimmers + \( 27 \) choir members and dancers = \( 57 \) students.
- Add the cheerleaders:  
  \( 57 + 9 = 66 \) people.

#### Final Answer:
**66 people** are leaving early to the tournament.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Olga has a flower bed that is 132 meters long. Olga wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Olga's flowers grow 3meters wide so she needs to leave 12 meters between every plant (including the plants width). Olga already owns 7 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ₣9 at the store. However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",31.0,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the total number of plants Olga needs for her flower bed.

The flower bed is **132 meters long**, and each plant (including the space it occupies and the space between plants) takes up **12 meters**. To find the total number of plants needed, divide the length of the flower bed by the space required per plant:

\[
\text{Total plants needed} = \frac{\text{Length of flower bed}}{\text{Space per plant}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11
\]

So, Olga needs **11 plants** in total.

---

### Step 2: Determine how many plants Olga needs to buy.

Olga already owns **7 flowers**, so the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:

\[
\text{Plants to buy} = \text{Total plants needed} - \text{Plants Olga already owns} = 11 - 7 = 4
\]

Olga needs to buy **4 plants**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the plants Olga needs to buy.

Each plant costs **₣9**, so the cost of 4 plants is:

\[
\text{Cost of 4 plants} = 4 \times 9 = ₣36
\]

Since Olga is buying more than 2 plants, she qualifies for a **₣5 discount** on the entire purchase. Subtract the discount from the total cost:

\[
\text{Total cost after discount} = ₣36 - ₣5 = ₣31
\]

---

### Final Answer:

Olga will spend **₣31** at the store to fill up her flower bed.",31.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Understand the problem**:  
   Olga has a flower bed that is 132 meters long. Each plant takes up 3 meters of space, and she needs to leave 12 meters between every plant (including the plant's width). Olga already owns 7 flowers, so she only needs to buy the remaining flowers. Each plant costs ₣9, and if she buys more than 2 plants, she gets a ₣5 discount on the total purchase.

2. **Calculate the total number of plants needed**:  
   Each plant and the space around it take up 12 meters. To find the total number of plants needed, divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:  
   \[
   \text{Total plants needed} = \frac{\text{Length of flower bed}}{\text{Space per plant}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11
   \]  
   So, Olga needs 11 plants in total.

3. **Determine how many plants Olga needs to buy**:  
   Olga already owns 7 flowers. Therefore, the number of plants she needs to buy is:  
   \[
   \text{Plants to buy} = \text{Total plants needed} - \text{Plants Olga already owns} = 11 - 7 = 4
   \]  
   Olga needs to buy 4 plants.

4. **Calculate the cost of the plants**:  
   Each plant costs ₣9. If Olga buys 4 plants, the total cost before any discount is:  
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = 4 \times 9 = ₣36
   \]  

5. **Apply the discount**:  
   Since Olga is buying more than 2 plants, she gets a ₣5 discount. The total cost after the discount is:  
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = ₣36 - ₣5 = ₣31
   \]

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,Olga can peel 6 clams a minute and saute 30 clams in 19 minutes. How many minutes will it take her to peel and saute 150 clams if it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam before peeling it? Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.,163.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Olga will take to wash, peel, and sauté 150 clams, considering the constraints provided. Let's break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Time to wash the clams
Olga takes **12 seconds** to wash each clam. For 150 clams, the total washing time is:

\[
\text{Washing time} = 150 \times 12 \, \text{seconds}
\]

Convert seconds to minutes (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

\[
\text{Washing time} = \frac{150 \times 12}{60} = 30 \, \text{minutes}
\]

So, it takes **30 minutes** to wash all the clams.

---

### Step 2: Time to peel the clams
Olga can peel **6 clams per minute**. For 150 clams, the total peeling time is:

\[
\text{Peeling time} = \frac{150}{6} = 25 \, \text{minutes}
\]

So, it takes **25 minutes** to peel all the clams.

---

### Step 3: Break time after peeling
After peeling the clams, Olga takes a **13-minute break** before she can start sautéing. This adds **13 minutes** to the total time.

---

### Step 4: Time to sauté the clams
Olga can sauté **30 clams in 19 minutes**. For 150 clams, the total sautéing time is:

\[
\text{Sautéing time} = \frac{150}{30} \times 19 = 5 \times 19 = 95 \, \text{minutes}
\]

So, it takes **95 minutes** to sauté all the clams.

---

### Step 5: Total time
Now, we add up all the times:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Washing time} + \text{Peeling time} + \text{Break time} + \text{Sautéing time}
\]

\[
\text{Total time} = 30 + 25 + 13 + 95 = 163 \, \text{minutes}
\]

---

### Final Answer:
It will take Olga **163 minutes** to wash, peel, and sauté 150 clams.",150.0,0,"Olga needs to peel, wash, and sauté 150 clams. Let's break this problem into steps.

### Step 1: Time to wash the clams

On Tuesday, he picks half the amount of what he picked in the past 3 days combined. On Wednesday, Andre is going to sell pineapples in boxes of 21 pineapples each. He is going to sell each box for $8. How much is Andre going to make?",408.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the number of pineapples Andre picked on Monday.
On Monday, Andre picks **double** the number of pineapples he picked on Saturday.  
He picked **177** pineapples on Saturday.  
So, on Monday, he picked:

\[
2 \times 177 = 354 \text{ pineapples.}
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of pineapples picked in the first 3 days (Saturday, Sunday, and Monday).
Andre picked:
- **177** pineapples on Saturday,
- **183** pineapples on Sunday,
- **354** pineapples on Monday.

The total for the first 3 days is:

\[
177 + 183 + 354 = 714 \text{ pineapples.}
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the number of pineapples Andre picked on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, Andre picks **half** the amount of what he picked in the past 3 days combined.  
The total for the first 3 days is **714** pineapples.  
So, on Tuesday, he picked:

\[
\frac{714}{2} = 357 \text{ pineapples.}
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of pineapples Andre picked in 4 days.
Andre picked:
- **714** pineapples in the first 3 days,
- **357** pineapples on Tuesday.

The total for all 4 days is:

\[
714 + 357 = 1071 \text{ pineapples.}
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate how many boxes of pineapples Andre can sell.
Each box contains **21 pineapples**.  
To find the number of boxes Andre can sell, divide the total number of pineapples by 21:

\[
\frac{1071}{21} = 51 \text{ boxes.}
\]

---

### Step 6: Calculate how much money Andre will make.
Andre sells each box for **$8**.  
If he sells **51 boxes**, the total amount of money he will make is:

\[
51 \times 8 = 408 \text{ dollars.}
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Andre is going to make **$408**.",408.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Pineapples picked on Saturday**:  
   Andre picks 177 pineapples on Saturday.

2. **Pineapples picked on Sunday**:  
   Andre picks 183 pineapples on Sunday.

3. **Pineapples picked on Monday**:  
   On Monday, Andre picks double the number of pineapples he did on Saturday.  
   So, the number of pineapples picked on Monday is 2 * 177 = 354.

4. **Total pineapples picked in the first 3 days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday)**:  
   Total = 177 (Saturday) + 183 (Sunday) + 354 (Monday) = 714.

5. **Pineapples picked on Tuesday**:  
   On Tuesday, Andre picks half the amount of what he picked in the past 3 days combined.  
   Half of 714 is 714 / 2 = 357.  
   So, Andre picks 357 pineapples on Tuesday.

6. **Total pineapples picked in 4 days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday)**:  
   Total = 714 (first 3 days) + 357 (Tuesday) = 1071.

7. **Number of boxes Andre can sell**:  
   Each box contains 21 pineapples.  
   The number of boxes Andre can sell is 1071 / 21 = 51 (since 1071 is divisible by 21).

8. **Money earned per box**:  
   Andre sells each box for $8.  
   So, the total money Andre makes is 51 * 8 = $408.

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 50% for the second half. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?",1755.0,"To solve this problem, we will calculate the total number of pizzas consumed by the family over the two months step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the daily pizza consumption for the family**
- The uncle eats **10 pizzas per day**.
- The spouse eats **20 pizzas per day**.
- Together, they eat \( 10 + 20 = 30 \) pizzas per day.
- The grandchild eats **two-fourths (or half)** of the combined number of pizzas they eat per day:
  \[
  \text{Grandchild's daily consumption} = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ pizzas per day}.
  \]
- Total daily consumption for the family:
  \[
  \text{Total daily consumption} = 10 + 20 + 15 = 45 \text{ pizzas per day}.
  \]

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the total pizza consumption for the first month**
- A month has 30 days.
- In the first month, the family eats 45 pizzas per day for 30 days:
  \[
  \text{Total pizzas in the first month} = 45 \times 30 = 1350 \text{ pizzas}.
  \]

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the pizza consumption for the second month**
#### **Step 3.1: First half of the second month (15 days)**
- In the first half of the second month, the family reduces their consumption by **60%**. This means they eat only **40%** of their original daily consumption:
  \[
  \text{Reduced daily consumption} = 0.4 \times 45 = 18 \text{ pizzas per day}.
  \]
- For 15 days, the total consumption is:
  \[
  \text{Total pizzas (first half)} = 18 \times 15 = 270 \text{ pizzas}.
  \]

#### **Step 3.2: Second half of the second month (15 days)**
- In the second half of the second month, the family reduces their consumption by an **additional 50%**. This means they eat only **50%** of their already reduced daily consumption:
  \[
  \text{Further reduced daily consumption} = 0.5 \times 18 = 9 \text{ pizzas per day}.
  \]
- For 15 days, the total consumption is:
  \[
  \text{Total pizzas (second half)} = 9 \times 15 = 135 \text{ pizzas}.
  \]

#### **Step 3.3: Total consumption for the second month**
- Add the pizzas consumed in the first and second halves of the second month:
  \[
  \text{Total pizzas (second month)} = 270 + 135 = 405 \text{ pizzas}.
  \]

---

### **Step 4: Total pizza consumption for two months**
- Add the total pizzas consumed in the first and second months:
  \[
  \text{Total pizzas (two months)} = 1350 + 405 = 1755 \text{ pizzas}.
  \]

---

### **Final Answer:**
The family eats **1755 pizzas** in two months.",1755.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten per day by the family.
- The uncle eats 10 pizzas per day.
- The spouse eats 20 pizzas per day.
- Together, they eat \( 10 + 20 = 30 \) pizzas per day.
- The grandchild eats two-fourths (or half) of the combined number of pizzas they eat per day. So, the grandchild eats \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) pizzas per day.
- Therefore, the total number of pizzas eaten by the family per day is:
  \[
  30 + 15 = 45 \text{ pizzas per day.}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten in the first month.
- There are 30 days in the first month.
- The family eats 45 pizzas per day.
- So, the total number of pizzas eaten in the first month is:
  \[
  45 \times 30 = 1350 \text{ pizzas.}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten in the second month.
#### First half of the second month:
- The family reduces their food consumption by 60%.
- This means they eat only \( 100\% - 60\% = 40\% \) of their usual daily consumption.
- \( 40\% \) of 45 pizzas is:
  \[
  0.4 \times 45 = 18 \text{ pizzas per day.}
  \]
- There are 15 days in the first half of the month.
- So, the total number of pizzas eaten in the first half of the second month is:
  \[
  18 \times 15 = 270 \text{ pizzas.}
  \]

#### Second half of the second month:
- The family reduces their food consumption by an additional 50%.
- This means they eat only \( 50\% \) of the 40% they were eating in the first half of the month.
- \( 50\% \) of \( 40\% \) is \( 20\% \) of their usual daily consumption.
- \( 20\% \) of 45 pizzas is:
  \[
  0.2 \times 45 = 9 \text{ pizzas per day.}
  \]
- There are 15 days in the second half of the month.
- So, the total number of pizzas eaten in the second half of the second month is:
  \[
  9 \times 15 = 135 \text{ pizzas.}
  \]

#### Total pizzas eaten in the second month:
- The total number of pizzas eaten in the second month is:
  \[
  270 + 135 = 405 \text{ pizzas.}
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten in two months.

After accounting for the 700 seats for graduate, 450 seats for the faculty attending, and reserving 50 seats for the event's staff, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?",12.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tickets each graduate will receive for their friends and family. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Total seating capacity
The Sports Arena has a total seating capacity of **9600 people**.

### Step 2: Subtract reserved seats
We need to subtract the seats reserved for graduates, faculty, and event staff:
- Seats for graduates: **700**
- Seats for faculty: **450**
- Seats for event staff: **50**

The total reserved seats are:
\[
700 + 450 + 50 = 1200
\]

Now, subtract the reserved seats from the total seating capacity:
\[
9600 - 1200 = 8400
\]

This means there are **8400 seats available** for friends and family.

### Step 3: Determine the number of graduates
There are **700 graduates**.

### Step 4: Divide the available seats equally among the graduates
To find how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, divide the available seats by the number of graduates:
\[
\frac{8400}{700} = 12
\]

### Final Answer:
Each graduate will receive **12 tickets** to give to their friends and family.",12.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The Sports Arena has space for 9600 people in total.

First, we account for the seats reserved for graduates, faculty, and staff:
- Seats for graduates: 700
- Seats for faculty: 450
- Seats for staff: 50

The total reserved seats are:
700 + 450 + 50 = 1200 seats.

Now, subtract the reserved seats from the total capacity of the arena to find the number of seats available for friends and family:
9600 - 1200 = 8400 seats.

Next, we need to determine how many tickets each graduate will receive. Since there are 700 graduates, the 8400 available seats will be split equally among them:
8400 ÷ 700 = 12 tickets per graduate.

How many emails does Mohammed respond to in a 6 day work week? Mohammed work overtime on the last day so he can respond to 10% more emails than usual.",61.0,"Let's break this problem into smaller steps and solve it step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the number of emails that don't require a response.
Mohammed receives **30 emails a day**, and **20% of those emails don't require a response**.

\[
\text{Emails that don't require a response per day} = 20\% \times 30 = 0.2 \times 30 = 6
\]

So, **6 emails per day don't require a response**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the number of emails that require a response.
The remaining emails **do require a response**. Subtract the emails that don't require a response from the total emails:

\[
\text{Emails that require a response per day} = 30 - 6 = 24
\]

So, **24 emails per day require a response**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate how many emails Mohammed can respond to on a normal day.
Mohammed can only respond to **2 less than half** of the emails that require a response. First, calculate half of the emails that require a response:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12
\]

Now subtract 2:

\[
\text{Emails Mohammed responds to per day} = 12 - 2 = 10
\]

So, Mohammed responds to **10 emails per day** on a normal day.

---

### Step 4: Calculate how many emails Mohammed responds to in a 6-day work week.
For the first **5 days**, Mohammed responds to **10 emails per day**:

\[
\text{Emails responded to in 5 days} = 10 \times 5 = 50
\]

On the **6th day**, Mohammed works overtime and responds to **10% more emails than usual**. First, calculate 10% of 10:

\[
10\% \times 10 = 0.1 \times 10 = 1
\]

So, on the 6th day, Mohammed responds to:

\[
10 + 1 = 11 \text{ emails.}
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of emails Mohammed responds to in 6 days.
Add the emails responded to in the first 5 days and the 6th day:

\[
\text{Total emails responded to in 6 days} = 50 + 11 = 61
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Mohammed responds to **61 emails** in a 6-day work week.",6.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Mohammed receives 30 emails a day.  
   20% of those emails don't require any response.  
   To find the number of emails that don't require a response:  
   \( 20\% \) of 30 is:  
   \( 30 \times 0.2 = 6 \).  
   So, 6 emails don't require a response.  

2. The remaining emails that require a response are:  
   \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).  

3. Mohammed can only respond to 2 less than half of the emails that require a response.  
   Half of 24 is:  
   \( 24 \div 2 = 12 \).  
   Subtract 2 from this:  
   \( 12 - 2 = 10 \).  
   So, Mohammed responds to 10 emails per day under normal circumstances.  

4. Mohammed works for 6 days in a work week.  
   For the first 5 days, he responds to 10 emails per day:  
   \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).  

5. On the last day (the 6th day), Mohammed works overtime and can respond to 10% more emails than usual.  
   10% more than 10 emails is:  
   \( 10 \times 0.1 = 1 \).  
   So, on the 6th day, he responds to:  
   \( 10 + 1 = 11 \) emails.  

6. The total number of emails Mohammed responds to in the 6-day work week is:

On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?",85.0,"We are tasked with finding the total time Ananya takes to complete her 24-mile walk, given the details about her walking speeds and times. Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define variables
Let Ananya's original walking speed on the beach (before her injury) be \( x \) miles per minute.  
Then, her original walking speed on the sidewalk is \( 2x \) miles per minute (since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk).  

After her injury, her walking speed is halved:  
- Her new speed on the beach is \( \frac{x}{2} \) miles per minute.  
- Her new speed on the sidewalk is \( x \) miles per minute.

---

### Step 2: Use the given time spent on the beach
We are told that Ananya spends **50 minutes walking on the beach**. Using the formula for distance (\( \text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \)), the distance she covers on the beach is:

\[
\text{Distance on beach} = \text{Speed on beach} \times \text{Time on beach}
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
10 = \frac{x}{2} \times 50
\]

Solve for \( x \):
\[
10 = 25x \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{10}{25} = \frac{2}{5} \, \text{miles per minute.}
\]

Thus:
- Her new speed on the beach is \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{2}{5} \, \text{miles per minute.} \)
- Her new speed on the sidewalk is \( x = \frac{2}{5} \, \text{miles per minute.} \)

---

### Step 3: Find the time spent on the sidewalk
The total distance Ananya walks on the sidewalk is 14 miles. Using the formula for time (\( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \)), the time she spends on the sidewalk is:

\[
\text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on sidewalk}}
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{14}{\frac{2}{5}} = 14 \times \frac{5}{2} = 35 \, \text{minutes.}
\]

---

### Step 4: Find the total time for the walk
The total time Ananya spends walking is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk}
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Total time} = 50 + 35 = 85 \, \text{minutes.}

### Final Answer:
Ananya takes **85 minutes** to complete her 24-mile walk.",24.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Understand the problem**:  
   Ananya walks 24 miles in total every day, which includes:
   - 10 miles on the beach.
   - 14 miles on the sidewalk.  
   On the sidewalk, she walks at **twice the speed** of her speed on the beach.  
   Due to an injury, her speed is reduced to **half** of her usual speed on both the beach and the sidewalk.  
   We are told that she spends **50 minutes walking on the beach**, and we need to calculate the total time it takes for her to complete the 24-mile walk.

---

2. **Define variables**:  
   Let Ananya's usual speed on the beach (before the injury) be \( x \) miles per minute.  
   - Her usual speed on the sidewalk is \( 2x \) miles per minute (twice her beach speed).  
   - After the injury, her speed on the beach is reduced to \( \frac{x}{2} \) miles per minute.  
   - After the injury, her speed on the sidewalk is reduced to \( \frac{2x}{2} = x \) miles per minute.

---

3. **Use the given information about the beach**:  
   Ananya spends **50 minutes walking on the beach**.  
   - Her speed on the beach after the injury is \( \frac{x}{2} \).  
   - The distance she walks on the beach is 10 miles.

Mei finds twice as many as Elena. Xavier finds 2 less than Mei. Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier, and Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined. How many cookies are still hidden in the yard?",64.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the total number of cookies Amelia initially had.
Amelia initially had **11 dozen cookies**. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies:
\[
11 \times 12 = 132 \text{ cookies.}
\]

---

### Step 2: Subtract the cookies Amelia ate for breakfast.
Amelia ate **5 cookies** for breakfast, so the remaining number of cookies is:
\[
132 - 5 = 127 \text{ cookies.}
\]

---

### Step 3: Track how many cookies each person finds.

#### Elena:
Elena finds **5 cookies**.

#### Mei:
Mei finds **twice as many as Elena**:
\[
2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cookies.}
\]

#### Xavier:
Xavier finds **2 less than Mei**:
\[
10 - 2 = 8 \text{ cookies.}
\]

#### Mohammed:
Mohammed finds **one-eighth as many as Xavier**:
\[
\frac{8}{8} = 1 \text{ cookie.}
\]

#### Umar:
Umar finds **two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined**. First, calculate how many cookies Mei and Elena found together:
\[
10 + 5 = 15 \text{ cookies.}
\]
Two dozen cookies is:
\[
2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ cookies.}
\]
So Umar finds:
\[
15 + 24 = 39 \text{ cookies.}
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of cookies found.
Add up the cookies found by all five people:
\[
5 + 10 + 8 + 1 + 39 = 63 \text{ cookies.}
\]

---

### Step 5: Subtract the cookies found from the total remaining cookies.
Initially, there were **127 cookies** after Amelia ate breakfast. Subtract the **63 cookies** that were found:
\[
127 - 63 = 64 \text{ cookies.}
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The number of cookies still hidden in the yard is:
\[
\boxed{64 \text{ cookies.}}
\]",64.0,1,"Amelia initially had 11 dozen cookies.  
- A dozen is 12 cookies, so 11 dozen cookies is \( 11 \times 12 = 132 \) cookies.  
Amelia ate 5 cookies for breakfast.  
- The remaining cookies are \( 132 - 5 = 127 \).  

Now, Amelia hid the remaining 127 cookies in the yard for the Easter egg hunt.  
Elena finds 5 cookies.  
- Mei finds twice as many as Elena, so Mei finds \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) cookies.  
- Xavier finds 2 less than Mei, so Xavier finds \( 10 - 2 = 8 \) cookies.  
- Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier, so Mohammed finds \( \frac{8}{8} = 1 \) cookie.  
- Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined.  
  - Mei and Elena combined find \( 10 + 5 = 15 \) cookies.  
  - Two dozen cookies is \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \).  
  - Umar finds \( 15 + 24 = 39 \) cookies.  

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies found:  
- Elena finds 5 cookies.  
- Mei finds 10 cookies.  
- Xavier finds 8 cookies.  
- Mohammed finds 1 cookie.  
- Umar finds 39 cookies.  
- The total number of cookies found is \( 5 + 10 + 8 + 1 + 39 = 63 \).  

Amelia initially hid 127 cookies in the yard.  
- After 63 cookies are found, the number of cookies still hidden is \( 127 - 63 = 64 \).

However, this week, 9 apartments from each of the first 2 complexes were vacant and did not require collection service. Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each place and he gets paid ₣0.5 per collection for each apartment. He also earns an additional 10% in tips. How much money does he make in a week?",1243.0,"Let's break this problem into smaller steps and solve it step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes.
Each of the first two apartment complexes has 100 apartments. Therefore, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is:

\[
100 + 100 = 200 \text{ apartments.}
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
The third complex is 35% bigger than the total number of apartments in the first two complexes. So, we calculate 35% of 200:

\[
35\% \text{ of } 200 = 0.35 \times 200 = 70.
\]

Thus, the third complex has:

\[
200 + 70 = 270 \text{ apartments.}
\]

---

### Step 3: Determine the number of apartments requiring garbage collection.
This week, 9 apartments in each of the first two complexes were vacant and did not require garbage collection. Therefore, the number of apartments requiring garbage collection in each of the first two complexes is:

\[
100 - 9 = 91 \text{ apartments.}
\]

So, the total number of apartments requiring garbage collection is:

\[
91 + 91 + 270 = 452 \text{ apartments.}
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of collections in a week.
Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections in a week is:

\[
452 \times 5 = 2260 \text{ collections.}
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate Oscar's earnings from collections.
Oscar gets paid ₣0.5 per collection. Therefore, his earnings from collections are:

\[
2260 \times 0.5 = ₣1130.
\]

---

### Step 6: Calculate Oscar's tips.
Oscar earns an additional 10% in tips. To calculate his tips, we find 10% of ₣1130:

\[
10\% \text{ of } ₣1130 = 0.1 \times 1130 = ₣113.

The cost of a 60-minute call is **₺24**.",24.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The cost of the call depends on the duration and the pricing structure. We will calculate the cost for each segment of the call and then apply the discount if applicable.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost for the first 10 minutes.
The price for the first 10 minutes is ₺0.8 per minute.
So, the cost for the first 10 minutes is:
\[
10 \times 0.8 = ₺8.0

However, due to a recent injury, the janitor has become slower and it will take them twice as long to clean a room these days. If they work for 8 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?",50.0,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine how long it takes the janitor to clean one room now.
The janitor used to take **6 minutes per room**, but now it takes them **twice as long** due to the injury. So:

\[
\text{Time per room} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \, \text{minutes per room}.
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total time required to clean all 200 rooms.
If it takes **12 minutes per room** and there are **200 rooms**, the total time required is:

\[
\text{Total time} = 200 \times 12 = 2400 \, \text{minutes}.
\]

---

### Step 3: Determine how many minutes the janitor works per day.
The janitor works **8 hours per day**, and there are **60 minutes in an hour**. So:

\[
\text{Minutes per day} = 8 \times 60 = 480 \, \text{minutes per day}.
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the number of days the janitor has to clean the building.
The janitor has **10 days** to clean the building.

---

### Step 5: Calculate how many minutes the janitor spends cleaning per day.
The janitor needs to clean **200 rooms** in **10 days**, so they must clean:

\[
\text{Rooms per day} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \, \text{rooms per day}.

After Noah takes the skillet off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. Noah gives one-fifth of the made popcorn to his brother Luca. How many more pieces of popcorn does Noah have to eat than his brother?",399.0,"Let's break this problem into steps to calculate how many pieces of popcorn Noah has to eat compared to his brother.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the number of kernels that pop in each 10-second interval.

#### First 10 seconds:
The problem states that **70 kernels** pop in the first 10 seconds.

#### Second 10 seconds:
The popping rate doubles, so:
\[
70 \times 2 = 140 \text{ kernels.}
\]

#### Third 10 seconds:
The popping rate increases to **4 times the initial rate**, so:
\[
70 \times 4 = 280 \text{ kernels.}
\]

#### Fourth 10 seconds:
The popping slows to **half the rate of the previous 10 seconds** (the third interval). So:
\[
280 \div 2 = 140 \text{ kernels.}
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the number of kernels that pop after the skillet is removed from the heat.

After the skillet is removed, **a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds** pop due to residual heat. So:
\[
140 \div 4 = 35 \text{ kernels.}
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of popped kernels.

Add up all the kernels that popped during and after cooking:
\[
70 + 140 + 280 + 140 + 35 = 665 \text{ kernels.}

- **Final 10 seconds:** Half the rate of the previous 10 seconds. So, \( 280 \div 2 = 140 \) kernels pop.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of kernels that pop from residual heat.
After the skillet is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds also pop. So:
\[
\text{Residual popping} = 140 \div 4 = 35 \text{ kernels.}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of popped kernels.
Add up all the kernels that popped:
\[
70 + 140 + 280 + 140 + 35 = 665 \text{ kernels.}

Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the variables
- The number of **white bricks** is given as \( 5 \).
- The number of **orange bricks** is **twice as many as white bricks**, so the number of orange bricks is:
  \[
  2 \times 5 = 10
  \]
- Let the number of **green bricks** be \( g \).

The total number of bricks in the building is \( 30 \).

---

### Step 2: Write an equation for the total number of bricks
The total number of bricks is the sum of white, orange, and green bricks:
\[
5 + 10 + g = 30

We are told that Olivia and Bodhi are 24 years apart in age, and Olivia is younger than Bodhi. Therefore, Bodhi's age is:

\[
\text{Bodhi's current age} = \text{Olivia's current age} + 24 = 35 + 24 = 59
\]

So, Bodhi is currently **59 years old**.

---

### Step 3: Determine Keisha's current age
We are told that Olivia and Keisha are 15 years apart in age, and Olivia is older than Keisha. Therefore, Keisha's age is:

\[
\text{Keisha's current age} = \text{Olivia's current age} - 15 = 35 - 15 = 20
\]

So, Keisha is currently **20 years old**.

---

### Step 4: Calculate the average age of all three
The average age of Olivia, Bodhi, and Keisha is given by:

\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Olivia's age} + \text{Bodhi's age} + \text{Keisha's age}}{3}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{35 + 59 + 20}{3} = \frac{114}{3} = 38
\]

So, the average age of all three is **38 years**.

---

### Step 5: Determine how much younger Keisha is than the average age
Keisha's age is 20, and the average age is 38. The difference is:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Average age} - \text{Keisha's age} = 38 - 20 = 18
\]

So, Keisha is **18 years younger** than the average age of all three.

### Final Answer:
Keisha is **18 years younger** than the average age of Olivia, Bodhi, and Keisha.",18.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine Olivia's current age:**
   - Olivia will be 42 in 7 years.
   - So, her current age is 42 - 7 = 35.

2. **Determine Bodhi's current age:**
   - Olivia and Bodhi are 24 years apart, and Olivia is younger than Bodhi.
   - So, Bodhi's current age is 35 + 24 = 59.

3. **Determine Keisha's current age:**
   - Olivia and Keisha are 15 years apart, and Olivia is older than Keisha.
   - So, Keisha's current age is 35 - 15 = 20.

4. **Calculate the average age of all three:**
   - The ages of Olivia, Bodhi, and Keisha are 35, 59, and 20, respectively.
   - The total age is 35 + 59 + 20 = 114.
   - The average age is 114 / 3 = 38.

5. **Determine how much younger Keisha is than the average age:**
   - The average age is 38, and Keisha's age is 20.
   - So, Keisha is 38 - 20 = 18 years younger than the average age.
