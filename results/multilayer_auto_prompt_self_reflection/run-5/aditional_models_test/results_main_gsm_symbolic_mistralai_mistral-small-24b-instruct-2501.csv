First, let's find out how much water is in the original 20 liters of peach drink. Since it's 1/5 water, we calculate:

Water in peach drink = (1/5) * 20 liters = 4 liters

Now, you spill 5 liters of the peach drink. Since the peach drink is 1/5 water, the spilled drink contains:

If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 6 hours if she spends 2/4 of the time running and three-sixths of the time walking?",36.0,"First, let's find out Jasmine's running speed. We know that her skipping speed is 6 miles per hour and that this is 3/5 of her running speed. So, we can set up the following equation to find her running speed (R):

3/5 * R = 6 mph

To find R, we divide both sides by 3/5:

R = 6 mph / (3/5)
R = 6 mph * (5/3)
R = 2 * 5 mph
R = 10 mph

So, Jasmine can run at 10 miles per hour.

Next, let's find out her walking speed. We know that she can run five times faster than she can walk. So, if her running speed is 10 mph, her walking speed (W) is:

W = R / 5
W = 10 mph / 5
W = 2 mph

Now, let's calculate the time she spends running and walking. She spends 2/4 (which simplifies to 1/2) of the time running and 3/6 (which simplifies to 1/2) of the time walking. Since both fractions are 1/2, she spends half of the time running and half of the time walking.

The total time she has is 6 hours. So, the time spent running (T_run) and the time spent walking (T_walk) are both:

T_run = T_walk = 6 hours * 1/2

   So, the remaining calories you can consume are 2360 - 1700 = 660 calories.

2. **Determine the calories per ounce of bread:**
   The bag has 5 servings and is 300 ounces.
   So, each serving is 300 / 5 = 60 ounces.
   Each serving has 275 calories.
   Therefore, the calories per ounce are 275 / 60 = 4.5833 (rounded to 4 decimal places).

3. **Calculate the number of ounces you can eat:**
   You can consume 660 more calories.
   Each ounce of bread has 4.5833 calories.
   So, the number of ounces you can eat is 660 / 4.5833 ≈ 144.01 ounces.

**Error Keywords:**
- Calculation error
- Arithmetic error
- Division error
- Unit conversion error

### Corrected Solution

1. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:**
   You have a daily calorie target of 2360 calories.
   You have already consumed 1700 calories.
   So, the remaining calories you can consume are:
   \[
   2360 - 1700 = 660 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the calories per ounce of bread:**
   The bag has 5 servings and is 300 ounces.
   So, each serving is:
   \[
   \frac{300 \text{ ounces}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 60 \text{ ounces per serving}
   \]
   Each serving has 275 calories.
   Therefore, the calories per ounce are:
   \[
   \frac{275 \text{ calories}}{60 \text{ ounces}} = 4.5833 \text{ calories per ounce}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of ounces you can eat:**
   You can consume 660 more calories.
   Each ounce of bread has 4.5833 calories.
   So, the number of ounces you can eat is:
   \[
   \frac{660 \text{ calories}}{4.5833 \text{ calories per ounce}} \approx 144.01 \text{ ounces}
   \]

The answer is approximately 144.01 ounces.

Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.

For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

[Example Input]
Question: A recipe calls for 3 cups of flour to make 24 cookies. If you have 6 cups of flour, how many cookies can you make?
Wrong answer: I thought that if 3 cups make 24 cookies, then 6 cups would make 48 cookies, because I doubled the amount of flour and the number of cookies.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the proportion of flour to cookies. I should have set up a proportion to find the correct number of cookies.
Error Keywords:
- Proportion
- Conversion
- Arithmetic operations
Instructions:
1. Identify the given ratio (3 cups of flour to 24 cookies).
2. Set up a proportion to find the number of cookies for 6 cups of flour.
3. Solve the proportion to find the correct number of cookies.
Advice:
- Always set up a proportion when dealing with ratios and conversions.
- Double-check your arithmetic operations to ensure accuracy.
Solution:
The correct number of cookies is 48. (3 cups / 24 cookies = 6 cups / x cookies, x = 48)

1. **Determine the rate of coverage:**

   To find out how long it takes to cover 1 mile, we divide the time by the distance:

Since each episode on Thursday is 30 minutes (or 0.5 hours), we can find out how many episodes he watched by dividing the total time he spent watching TV on Thursday by the length of each episode:
2.5 hours / 0.5 hours/episode = 5 episodes

Therefore, Theo watched 5 episodes of the 30-minute show on Thursday.",30.0,0,"Theo watched a 6-hour episode on Tuesday and a 6-hour episode on Wednesday, so that's 6 + 6 = 12 hours.
On Friday, he watched a 2-hour episode and a 30-minute show, so that's 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 hours.
On Saturday, he watched three 4-hour episodes, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 hours.
So far, the total time spent watching TV is 12 (Tuesday and Wednesday) + 2.5 (Friday) + 12 (Saturday) = 26.5 hours.
Theo watched 29 hours of TV in all, so the time spent watching 30-minute episodes on Thursday is 29 - 26.5 = 2.5 hours.
Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Thursday is 2.5 / 0.5 = 5.

How much did Xavier spend on everything?",291.0,"To find out how much Xavier spent on everything, we need to calculate the total cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of markers:**
   Xavier bought 16 markers at ₺7.0 each.
   Total cost for markers = 16 markers * ₺7.0/marker = ₺112.0

2. **Cost of rulers:**
   Xavier bought 12 rulers at ₺13.75 each.
   Total cost for rulers = 12 rulers * ₺13.75/ruler = ₺165.0

3. **Cost of a rim of bond paper:**
   The cost is given as ₺14.0

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:

Total amount spent = Cost of markers + Cost of rulers + Cost of bond paper
Total amount spent = ₺112.0 + ₺165.0 + ₺14.0
Total amount spent = ₺291.0

Xavier spent a total of ₺291.0 on school supplies.",291.0,1,"To find out how much Xavier spent on everything, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of markers:**

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**

   A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

   \[

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**

   The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

   \[
   P(\text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}

2. **Calculate the value of the shares after the first year (60% increase):**

   Increase in value = 0.60 * ₣1275 = ₣765

   - Sofia wants $6 in pinball tokens.

3. **Roller Coaster Rides:**

5. Add the new number of apples and oranges to find the total.

Advice:
- Always double-check the interpretation of ratios and arithmetic operations.
- Ensure that the calculations are performed accurately and in the correct order.
- Verify the final answer by checking the calculations and the interpretation of the problem.

Solution:
Maria initially has 7 * 28 = 196 apples. After buying 30 more oranges, she has 28 + 30 = 58 oranges. Since she has 25 fewer apples than oranges, she has 58 - 25 = 33 apples. Therefore, the total number of apples and oranges is 196 + 58 = 254.

Sofia bought 23 kgs of fudge. The first 16 kgs are at the full price of ¥21 per kg, and the remaining 7 kgs are at 2/3 off the full price.

The cost of the first 16 kgs of fudge is:
16 kgs * ¥21/kg = ¥336

The discount for the remaining 7 kgs is 2/3 off of ¥21, which is:

- So, the total cost for the fudge is ¥336 + ¥98 = ¥434.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixed bag of sand dollars:
- The cost is ¥11.5.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the postcards:
- The cost of 17 postcards at ¥20.5 each is 17 * ¥20.5 = ¥348.5.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of fudge + Cost of sand dollars + Cost of postcards
- Total cost = ¥434 + ¥11.5 + ¥348.5 = ¥794.

Finally, let's calculate how much money Sofia has left:
- Sofia started with ¥1200.
- She spent ¥794.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Sofia went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her ¥1200 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, fudge was on sale for ""Buy 16 kgs at ¥21 per kg, get 5 kgs 2/3 off."" She scooped up 23 kgs. She also bought a mixed bag of sand dollars for ¥11.5 and 17 postcards that were ¥20.5 each. How much money does Sofia have left?
Your initial answer was: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the fudge, the mixed bag of sand dollars, and the postcards, then subtract that from the total amount of money Sofia had.

First, let's calculate the cost of the fudge:
- The cost of 16 kgs of fudge at ¥21 per kg is 16 * ¥21 = ¥336.
- The cost of the additional 7 kgs (since she bought 23 kgs in total) at the discounted price is 7 * (¥21 * 2/3) = 7 * ¥14 = ¥98.
- So, the total cost for the fudge is ¥336 + ¥98 = ¥434.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixed bag of sand dollars:
- The cost is ¥11.5.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the postcards:
- The cost of 17 postcards at ¥20.5 each is 17 * ¥20.5 = ¥348.5.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of fudge + Cost of sand dollars + Cost of postcards
- Total cost = ¥434 + ¥11.5 + ¥348.5 = ¥794.

Finally, let's calculate how much money Sofia has left:
- Sofia started with ¥1200.
- She spent ¥794.
- So, the money left is ¥1200 - ¥794 = ¥406.

The answer is ¥406.
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","### Reflection

**Explanation:**
I incorrectly calculated the cost of the fudge, specifically the discounted price for the additional 7 kgs. I misinterpreted the discount as a flat rate rather than a percentage off the original price. This led to an incorrect total cost for the fudge, which in turn affected the final calculation of Sofia's remaining money.

**Error Keywords:**
- Calculation error
- Misinterpretation of discount
- Arithmetic error
- Incorrect application of percentage discount

### Corrected Solution

1. **Calculate the cost of the fudge:**
   - The cost of 16 kgs of fudge at ¥21 per kg is:
     \[
     16 \times ¥21 = ¥336
     \]
   - The discount for the additional 7 kgs is 2/3 off the original price of ¥21 per kg:
     \[
     \text{Discounted price per kg} = ¥21 \times \frac{2}{3} = ¥14
     \]
   - The cost of the additional 7 kgs at the discounted price is:
     \[
     7 \times ¥14 = ¥98
     \]
   - So, the total cost for the fudge is:
     \[
     ¥336 + ¥98 = ¥434
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the mixed bag of sand dollars:**
   - The cost is ¥11.5.

3. **Calculate the cost of the postcards:**
   - The cost of 17 postcards at ¥20.5 each is:
     \[
     17 \times ¥20.5 = ¥348.5
     \]

4. **Add up all the costs:**
   - Total cost = Cost of fudge + Cost of sand dollars + Cost of postcards
   - Total cost = ¥434 + ¥11.5 + ¥348.5 = ¥794

5. **Calculate how much money Sofia has left:**
   - Sofia started with ¥1200.
   - She spent ¥794.
   - So, the money left is:
     \[
     ¥1200 - ¥794 = ¥406
     \]

The answer is ¥406.

### Instructions for Future Problems

1. **Identify all items and their costs:**
   - List each item Sofia bought and its respective cost.

2. **Calculate the cost of each item:**
   - For the fudge, calculate the cost of the first 16 kgs and the additional 7 kgs separately, applying the correct discount.

3. **Sum up the total cost:**
   - Add the costs of all items to get the total expenditure.

4. **Subtract the total cost from the initial amount:**
   - Calculate the remaining money by subtracting the total cost from the initial amount of ¥1200.

1. **Calculate the cost of the fudge:**
   - Sofia bought 23 kgs of fudge.
   - The first 16 kgs are at ¥21 per kg: 16 kgs * ¥21/kg = ¥336.
   - The remaining 7 kgs (23 kgs - 16 kgs) are at 2/3 off the original price.
   - The original price for 7 kgs is 7 kgs * ¥21/kg = ¥147.
   - The discount is 2/3 of ¥147, which is (2/3) * ¥147 = ¥98.
   - The discounted price for 7 kgs is ¥147 - ¥98 = ¥49.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the fudge:**
   - Total cost of fudge = ¥336 (first 16 kgs) + ¥49 (remaining 7 kgs) = ¥385.

3. **Calculate the cost of the postcards:**
   - 17 postcards at ¥20.5 each: 17 * ¥20.5 = ¥348.5.

4. **Calculate the total cost of all items:**
   - Total cost = ¥385 (fudge) + ¥11.5 (sand dollars) + ¥348.5 (postcards) = ¥745.

5. **Calculate the remaining money:**
   - Sofia starts with ¥1200.
   - Remaining money = ¥1200 - ¥745 = ¥455.

**Final Answer:**
Sofia has ¥455 left.

### Instructions for Future Reference:

1. **Identify the total amount of money Sofia has.**
2. **List the items Sofia bought and their prices, including any discounts or special offers.**
3. **Calculate the cost of the fudge, taking into account the discount for the additional kgs.**
4. **Calculate the cost of the postcards by multiplying the number of postcards by the price per postcard.**
5. **Add the cost of the sand dollars.**
6. **Sum the total cost of all items.**
7. **Subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money to find the remaining amount.**

### General Advice:

- Always carefully read the problem to understand any discounts or special offers.
- Break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
- Double-check your calculations for each step, especially when dealing with discounts and multiple items.
- Ensure you account for all items and their costs, including any additional charges or discounts.
- Be mindful of the order of operations when performing calculations.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

She also bought a mixed bag of sand dollars for ¥11.5 and 17 postcards that were ¥20.5 each. How much money does Sofia have left?",427.0,"Let's calculate the cost of the fudge first. Sofia bought 23 kgs of fudge. The first 16 kgs are at the full price of ¥21 per kg, and the remaining 7 kgs are at 2/3 off the full price.

The cost of the first 16 kgs of fudge is:
16 kgs * ¥21/kg = ¥336

The discount for the remaining 7 kgs is 2/3 off of ¥21, which is:
¥21 * (2/3) = ¥14

So, the discounted price per kg for the remaining 7 kgs is:
¥21 - ¥14 = ¥7/kg

The cost of the remaining 7 kgs of fudge is:
7 kgs * ¥7/kg = ¥49

The total cost of the fudge is:
¥336 + ¥49 = ¥385

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixed bag of sand dollars and the postcards.

The cost of the mixed bag of sand dollars is:
¥11.5

The cost of the 17 postcards is:
17 postcards * ¥20.5/postcard = ¥348.5

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Total cost of fudge + cost of sand dollars + cost of postcards
¥385 + ¥11.5 + ¥348.5 = ¥745

Finally, let's subtract the total cost from the amount Sofia's parents gave her:
¥1200 - ¥745 = ¥455

Sofia has ¥455 left.",455.0,0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the fudge, the mixed bag of sand dollars, and the postcards, then subtract that from the total amount of money Sofia had.

First, let's calculate the cost of the fudge:
- The cost of 16 kgs of fudge at ¥21 per kg is 16 * ¥21 = ¥336.
- The cost of the additional 7 kgs (since she bought 23 kgs in total) at the discounted price is 7 * (¥21 * 2/3) = 7 * ¥14 = ¥98.
- So, the total cost for the fudge is ¥336 + ¥98 = ¥434.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixed bag of sand dollars:
- The cost is ¥11.5.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the postcards:
- The cost of 17 postcards at ¥20.5 each is 17 * ¥20.5 = ¥348.5.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of fudge + Cost of sand dollars + Cost of postcards
- Total cost = ¥434 + ¥11.5 + ¥348.5 = ¥794.

Finally, let's calculate how much money Sofia has left:
- Sofia started with ¥1200.
- She spent ¥794.

1. **Calculate the amount of money Liam had left in change:**
   Liam had 8% of his money left in change. So, the amount of change he had is:
   \[
   \text{Change} = 1000 \times 0.08 = 80 \text{ cents}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount spent on popcorn and pretzels:**
   Liam spent 1000 cents initially and had 80 cents left, so the total amount spent is:
   \[
   \text{Total spent} = 1000 - 80 = 920 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount spent on popcorn:**
   Liam bought 4 bags of popcorn, each costing 25 cents. So, the total amount spent on popcorn is:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on popcorn} = 4 \times 25 = 100 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount spent on pretzels:**
   The total amount spent on pretzels is the total amount spent minus the amount spent on popcorn:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on pretzels} = 920 - 100 = 820 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of pretzels bought:**
   Each pretzel costs 100 cents. So, the number of pretzels Liam bought is:
   \[
   \text{Number of pretzels} = \frac{820}{100} = 8.2
   \]

Since Liam cannot buy a fraction of a pretzel, there seems to be a mistake in the calculation or the problem statement. Let's recheck the steps.

**Rechecking the steps:**

1. Liam spent 920 cents in total.
2. He spent 100 cents on popcorn.
3. He had 820 cents left for pretzels.

Since each pretzel costs 100 cents, the number of pretzels should be a whole number. Let's recheck the division:

\[
\text{Number of pretzels} = \frac{820}{100} = 8.2
\]

The result is still 8.2, which is not possible. Therefore, there might be an error in the problem statement or the initial conditions provided. Please double-check the problem statement.",8.2,0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Liam spent on popcorn and pretzels, and then calculate how many pretzels he bought.

1. **Calculate the total amount spent on popcorn:**
   - Liam bought 4 bags of popcorn.
   - Each bag of popcorn costs 25 cents.
   - Total cost for popcorn = 4 bags * 25 cents/bag = 100 cents.

2. **Determine the total amount Liam had initially:**
   - Liam had ₣1000 initially.
   - He had 8% of his money left in change.
   - Amount left in change = 8% of ₣1000 = 0.08 * ₣1000 = ₣80.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Total amount spent = Initial amount - Amount left in change.
   - Total amount spent = ₣1000 - ₣80 = ₣920.

4. **Calculate the amount spent on pretzels:**
   - Total amount spent on popcorn = 100 cents.
   - Total amount spent = ₣920.
   - Amount spent on pretzels = Total amount spent - Amount spent on popcorn.
   - Amount spent on pretzels = ₣920 - ₣100 = ₣820.

5. **Calculate the number of pretzels bought:**
   - Each pretzel costs 100 cents.
   - Number of pretzels = Amount spent on pretzels / Cost per pretzel.
   - Number of pretzels = ₣820 / 100 cents = 8.2.

main,gsm-symbolic,mistralai/mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501,The vending machines sell popcorn for 25 cents and pretzels for 100 cents. Liam spent ₣1000 and got 4 bags of popcorn and had 8% of his money left in change. How many pretzels did he buy?,919.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of money Liam had left in change:**
   Liam had 8% of his money left in change. So, the amount of change he had is:
   \[
   \text{Change} = 1000 \times 0.08 = 80 \text{ cents}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount spent on popcorn and pretzels:**
   Liam spent 1000 cents initially and had 80 cents left, so the total amount spent is:
   \[
   \text{Total spent} = 1000 - 80 = 920 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount spent on popcorn:**
   Liam bought 4 bags of popcorn, each costing 25 cents. So, the total amount spent on popcorn is:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on popcorn} = 4 \times 25 = 100 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount spent on pretzels:**
   The total amount spent on pretzels is the total amount spent minus the amount spent on popcorn:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on pretzels} = 920 - 100 = 820 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of pretzels bought:**
   Each pretzel costs 100 cents. So, the number of pretzels Liam bought is:
   \[
   \text{Number of pretzels} = \frac{820}{100} = 8.2
   \]

Since Liam cannot buy a fraction of a pretzel, there seems to be a mistake in the calculation or the problem statement. Let's recheck the steps.

**Rechecking the steps:**

1. Liam spent 920 cents in total.
2. He spent 100 cents on popcorn.
3. He had 820 cents left for pretzels.

Since each pretzel costs 100 cents, the number of pretzels should be a whole number. Let's recheck the division:

\[
\text{Number of pretzels} = \frac{820}{100} = 8.2
\]

The result is still 8.2, which is not possible. Therefore, there might be an error in the problem statement or the initial conditions provided. Please double-check the problem statement.",8.2,0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Liam spent on popcorn and pretzels, and then calculate how many pretzels he bought.

1. **Calculate the total amount spent on popcorn:**
   - Liam bought 4 bags of popcorn.
   - Each bag of popcorn costs 25 cents.
   - Total cost for popcorn = 4 bags * 25 cents/bag = 100 cents.

2. **Determine the total amount Liam had initially:**
   - Liam had ₣1000 initially.
   - He had 8% of his money left in change.
   - Amount left in change = 8% of ₣1000 = 0.08 * ₣1000 = ₣80.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Total amount spent = Initial amount - Amount left in change.
   - Total amount spent = ₣1000 - ₣80 = ₣920.

4. **Calculate the amount spent on pretzels:**
   - Total amount spent on popcorn = 100 cents.
   - Total amount spent = ₣920.
   - Amount spent on pretzels = Total amount spent - Amount spent on popcorn.
   - Amount spent on pretzels = ₣920 - ₣100 = ₣820.

5. **Calculate the number of pretzels bought:**
   - Each pretzel costs 100 cents.
   - Number of pretzels = Amount spent on pretzels / Cost per pretzel.
   - Number of pretzels = ₣820 / 100 cents = 8.2.

Since Liam cannot buy a fraction of a pretzel, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

- Rounding error

### Corrected Solution:

1. **Determine the total amount Liam had initially:**
   - Liam had ₣1000 initially.
   - He had 8% of his money left in change.
   - Amount left in change = 8% of ₣1000 = 0.08 * ₣1000 = ₣80.

2. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Total amount spent = Initial amount - Amount left in change.
   - Total amount spent = ₣1000 - ₣80 = ₣920.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent on popcorn:**
   - Liam bought 4 bags of popcorn.
   - Each bag of popcorn costs 25 cents.
   - Total cost for popcorn = 4 bags * 25 cents/bag = 100 cents.

4. **Convert the cost of popcorn to the local currency (₣):**
   - 100 cents = ₣1 (assuming 100 cents = ₣1 for simplicity).
   - Total cost for popcorn = ₣1.

5. **Calculate the amount spent on pretzels:**
   - Total amount spent = ₣920.
   - Amount spent on pretzels = Total amount spent - Amount spent on popcorn.
   - Amount spent on pretzels = ₣920 - ₣1 = ₣919.

6. **Calculate the number of pretzels bought:**
   - Each pretzel costs 100 cents = ₣1.
   - Number of pretzels = Amount spent on pretzels / Cost per pretzel.
   - Number of pretzels = ₣919 / ₣1 = 919.

The answer is 919 pretzels.

Question: A store sells apples for 50 cents each and oranges for 75 cents each. Sarah spent ₣1500 and got 6 apples and had 15% of her money left in change. How many oranges did she buy?

Wrong answer: Sarah bought 8 oranges. I calculated the total amount spent on apples as 6 * 50 = 300 cents, which is 300 cents. I then subtracted this from the total amount spent, which is 1500 cents, to get 1200 cents. I then divided this by the cost of an orange, which is 75 cents, to get 16 oranges. However, I did not account for the 15% of the money left in change, which means I should have subtracted this from the total amount spent before calculating the number of oranges.

Correct answer: Sarah bought 10 oranges. The total amount spent on apples is 6 * 50 = 300 cents. The 15% of the money left in change is 1500 * 0.15 = 225 cents. The total amount spent on oranges is 1500 - 300 - 225 = 975 cents. The number of oranges bought is 975 / 75 = 13 oranges.

[Example Input]
Question: A store sells apples for 50 cents each and oranges for 75 cents each. Sarah spent ₣1500 and bought 6 apples and had 15% of her money left in change. How many oranges did she buy?
Wrong answer: Sarah bought 10 oranges. I calculated the total cost of apples as 6 * 50 = 300 cents, then subtracted this from 1500 cents to get 1200 cents. I then divided 1200 by 75 to get 16, but I didn't account for the 15% change correctly.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the amount of money Sarah had left after buying apples and oranges. I did not account for the 15% change correctly, which led to an incorrect calculation of the number of oranges.
Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation of remaining money
- Incorrect percentage calculation
- Incorrect division
Instructions:
1. Calculate the total cost of apples: 6 apples * 50 cents/apple = 300 cents.
2. Determine the amount of money Sarah had left after buying apples: 1500 cents - 300 cents = 1200 cents.
3. Calculate the amount of money that represents 15% of the total money Sarah had: 1500 cents * 0.15 = 225 cents.
4. Subtract the 15% change from the remaining money: 1200 cents - 225 cents = 975 cents.
5. Divide the remaining money by the cost of one orange to find the number of oranges: 975 cents / 75 cents/orange = 13 oranges.
Advice:
- Always account for the percentage of change correctly.

1. **Calculate the amount of money Liam had left in change:**
   Liam had 8% of his money left in change. So, the amount of change he had is:
   \[
   \text{Change} = 1000 \times 0.08 = 80 \text{ cents}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount spent on popcorn and pretzels:**
   Liam spent 1000 cents initially and had 80 cents left, so the total amount spent is:
   \[
   \text{Total spent} = 1000 - 80 = 920 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount spent on popcorn:**
   Liam bought 4 bags of popcorn, each costing 25 cents. So, the total amount spent on popcorn is:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on popcorn} = 4 \times 25 = 100 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount spent on pretzels:**
   The total amount spent on pretzels is the total amount spent minus the amount spent on popcorn:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on pretzels} = 920 - 100 = 820 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of pretzels bought:**
   Each pretzel costs 100 cents. So, the number of pretzels Liam bought is:
   \[
   \text{Number of pretzels} = \frac{820}{100} = 8.2
   \]

Since Liam cannot buy a fraction of a pretzel, there seems to be a mistake in the calculation or the problem statement. Let's recheck the steps.

**Rechecking the steps:**

1. Liam spent 920 cents in total.
2. He spent 100 cents on popcorn.
3. He had 820 cents left for pretzels.

Since each pretzel costs 100 cents, the number of pretzels should be a whole number. Let's recheck the division:

\[
\text{Number of pretzels} = \frac{820}{100} = 8.2
\]

The result is still 8.2, which is not possible. Therefore, there might be an error in the problem statement or the initial conditions provided. Please double-check the problem statement.",8.2,0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Liam spent on popcorn and pretzels, and then calculate how many pretzels he bought.

1. **Calculate the total amount spent on popcorn:**
   - Liam bought 4 bags of popcorn.
   - Each bag of popcorn costs 25 cents.
   - Total cost for popcorn = 4 bags * 25 cents/bag = 100 cents.

2. **Determine the total amount Liam had initially:**
   - Liam had ₣1000 initially.
   - He had 8% of his money left in change.
   - Amount left in change = 8% of ₣1000 = 0.08 * ₣1000 = ₣80.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Total amount spent = Initial amount - Amount left in change.
   - Total amount spent = ₣1000 - ₣80 = ₣920.

4. **Calculate the amount spent on pretzels:**
   - Total amount spent on popcorn = 100 cents.
   - Total amount spent = ₣920.
   - Amount spent on pretzels = Total amount spent - Amount spent on popcorn.
   - Amount spent on pretzels = ₣920 - ₣100 = ₣820.

5. **Calculate the number of pretzels bought:**
   - Each pretzel costs 100 cents.
   - Number of pretzels = Amount spent on pretzels / Cost per pretzel.
   - Number of pretzels = ₣820 / 100 cents = 8.2.

Since Liam cannot buy a fraction of a pretzel, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

   Total length of remoras in inches = 6 remoras * 96 inches/remora = 576 inches

2. **Convert the total length of the remoras to feet:**
   Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide the total length in inches by 12 to get the length in feet.
   Total length of remoras in feet = 576 inches / 12 inches/foot = 48 feet

- Booties: 16 skeins

Adding these together:

10 (tunic) + 7 (beanie) + 11 (vest) + 15 (mittens) + 16 (booties) = 59 skeins

Now, since Yara has 5 grandchildren, we multiply the number of skeins needed for one grandchild by 5:

59 skeins/grandchild × 5 grandchildren = 295 skeins

Therefore, Yara will need to buy 295 skeins of wool.",295.0,1,"To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of skeins of wool Yara needs for each type of winter wear and then sum them up for all five grandchildren.

1. **Tunic**: 10 skeins per tunic
   - For 5 grandchildren: 10 skeins/tunic * 5 tunics = 50 skeins

2. **Beanie**: 7 skeins per beanie
   - For 5 grandchildren: 7 skeins/beanie * 5 beanies = 35 skeins

3. **Vest**: 11 skeins per vest
   - For 5 grandchildren: 11 skeins/vest * 5 vests = 55 skeins

4. **Mittens**: 15 skeins per pair of mittens
   - For 5 grandchildren: 15 skeins/pair * 5 pairs = 75 skeins

5. **Booties**: 16 skeins per pair of booties
   - For 5 grandchildren: 16 skeins/pair * 5 pairs = 80 skeins

Now, we add up all the skeins needed for each type of winter wear:

Total skeins = 50 (tunics) + 35 (beanies) + 55 (vests) + 75 (mittens) + 80 (booties)
Total skeins = 50 + 35 + 55 + 75 + 80 = 295

1. **Total time hired**: From 3 PM to 8 PM is 5 hours.
2. **Free hours**: Theo gets 2 hours free.
3. **Paid hours**: 5 hours (total) - 2 hours (free) = 3 hours (paid).

Now, let's calculate the cost:

1. **First paid hour**: $24.
2. **Remaining paid hours**: 3 hours (total paid) - 1 hour (first paid) = 2 hours.
3. **Cost for each subsequent hour**: Twice the cost of the first hour, so 2 * $24 = $48 per hour.

Now, calculate the total cost:

- First hour: $24
- Next two hours: 2 hours * $48/hour = $96

Total cost = First hour + Next two hours = $24 + $96 = $120

Theo paid $120 for the party bus.",120.0,1,"Theo hires the party bus from 3 PM to 8 PM, which is a total of 5 hours. He gets 2 hours free, so he has to pay for 5 - 2 = 3 hours.

Question: Kimia has a flower bed that is 180 feet long. Kimia wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Kimia's flowers grow 3 feet wide so she needs to leave 15.0 feet between every plant. Kimia already owns 11 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ¥3 at the store, how much money will Kimia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?
Your initial answer was: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many plants Kimia can fit in her 180-foot-long flower bed, considering the space each plant requires, and then calculate the cost of the additional plants she needs to buy.

1. **Determine the total space required for each plant:**
   Each plant grows 3 feet wide and requires 15.0 feet of space between plants. So, the total space required for each plant is:
   3 feet (width of the plant) + 15.0 feet (space between plants) = 18.0 feet per plant.

2. **Calculate the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   The flower bed is 180 feet long. To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required per plant:
   180 feet / 18.0 feet per plant = 10 plants.

3. **Determine how many additional plants Kimia needs to buy:**
   Kimia already owns 11 plants. Since she can fit 10 plants in the flower bed, she does not need to buy any additional plants.

4. **Calculate the cost of the additional plants:**
   Since Kimia does not need to buy any additional plants, the cost will be:
   0 plants * ¥3 per plant = ¥0.

The answer is ¥0.

","### Reflection

**Explanation:**
I incorrectly assumed that the space between plants should be included in the total space required for each plant. This led to an incorrect calculation of the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed. Additionally, I did not account for the fact that the first plant does not require space before it, which affects the total number of plants that can fit.

**Error Keywords:**
- Misinterpretation of the problem
- Incorrect calculation of space requirements
- Misunderstanding of the arrangement of plants
- Arithmetic error
- Logical error

### Corrected Solution

1. **Determine the total space required for each plant:**
   Each plant grows 3 feet wide and requires 15.0 feet of space between plants. However, the first plant does not require space before it. So, the total space required for each plant, starting from the second plant, is:
   3 feet (width of the plant) + 15.0 feet (space between plants) = 18.0 feet per plant.

2. **Calculate the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   The flower bed is 180 feet long. To find out how many plants can fit, we need to consider the space for the first plant and then the space for the subsequent plants.
   - The first plant takes 3 feet.
   - The remaining space is 180 feet - 3 feet = 177 feet.
   - Each subsequent plant requires 18.0 feet.
   - The number of additional plants that can fit is 177 feet / 18.0 feet per plant = 9.8333 plants.
   Since we cannot have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 9 additional plants.

3. **Total number of plants:**
   - 1 (first plant) + 9 (additional plants) = 10 plants.

4. **Determine how many additional plants Kimia needs to buy:**
   Kimia already owns 11 plants. Since she can fit 10 plants in the flower bed, she does not need to buy any additional plants.

5. **Calculate the cost of the additional plants:**
   Since Kimia does not need to buy any additional plants, the cost will be:
   0 plants * ¥3 per plant = ¥0.

The answer is ¥0.

[Example Input]

Question: A farmer has a field that is 200 meters long. The farmer wants to plant trees along the length of the field. Each tree requires 4 meters of space, and the farmer needs to leave 10 meters between every tree. The farmer already owns 12 trees. Each tree costs $5 at the nursery, how much money will the farmer spend at the nursery to fill up the field?

Wrong answer: The farmer needs to plant 200 / 4 = 50 trees. Since the farmer already owns 12 trees, he needs to buy 50 - 12 = 38 more trees. Therefore, the farmer will spend 38 * $5 = $190 at the nursery.

Correct answer: The farmer needs to plant 200 / (4 + 10) = 16.67, which rounds down to 16 trees (since you can't plant a fraction of a tree). Since the farmer already owns 12 trees, he needs to buy 16 - 12 = 4 more trees. Therefore, the farmer will spend 4 * $5 = $20 at the nursery.

[Example Output]

Explanation:
I did not account for the space between the trees when calculating the number of trees needed. I also did not round down the number of trees, which is necessary because you can't plant a fraction of a tree.

Error Keywords:
- Arithmetic error
- Misinterpretation of spatial requirements
- Incorrect rounding

Instructions:
1. Determine the total space required for each tree, including the space between them.
2. Divide the total length of the field by the total space required for each tree to find the number of trees that can be planted.
3. Round down the number of trees to the nearest whole number, as you can't plant a fraction of a tree.
4. Subtract the number of trees already owned from the total number of trees needed.
5. Multiply the number of trees needed by the cost per tree to find the total cost.

Advice:
- Always consider the space between objects when solving spatial problems.
- Be mindful of rounding when dealing with whole objects.
- Double-check your arithmetic to ensure accuracy.

Solution:
The farmer needs to plant 200 / (4 + 10) = 16.67, which rounds down to 16 trees. Since the farmer already owns 12 trees, he needs to buy 16 - 12 = 4 more trees. Therefore, the farmer will spend 4 * $5 = $20 at the nursery.

   The flower bed is 180 feet long. To find out how many plants Kimia can fit, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:
   \[
   \frac{180 \text{ feet}}{18 \text{ feet per plant}} = 10 \text{ plants}

3. **Calculate the number of additional plants Kimia needs to buy:**
   Kimia already owns 11 plants. Since she can fit 10 plants in the flower bed, she does not need to buy any additional plants.

4. **Calculate the cost of the additional plants:**
   Since Kimia does not need to buy any additional plants, the cost will be:
   \[
   0 \text{ plants} \times ¥3 \text{ per plant} = ¥0
   \]

Therefore, Kimia will spend ¥0 at the store to fill up her flower bed.",0.0,0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many plants Kimia can fit in her 180-foot-long flower bed, considering the space each plant requires, and then calculate the cost of the additional plants she needs to buy.

1. **Determine the total space required for each plant:**
   Each plant grows 3 feet wide and requires 15.0 feet of space between plants. So, the total space required for each plant is:
   3 feet (width of the plant) + 15.0 feet (space between plants) = 18.0 feet per plant.

2. **Calculate the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   The flower bed is 180 feet long. To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required per plant:

[Example Input]

Question: A gardener has a rectangular garden that is 200 feet long. The gardener wants to plant trees along the length of the garden. Each tree requires 4 feet of space, and the gardener needs to leave 10 feet between every tree. The gardener already owns 10 trees. Each tree costs $5 at the nursery. How much money will the gardener spend at the nursery to fill up the garden?

Wrong answer: The gardener needs to plant 40 trees (200 feet / 5 feet per tree). The gardener already has 10 trees, so the gardener needs to buy 30 more trees. The cost will be 30 trees * $5/tree = $150.

Correct answer: The gardener needs to plant 35 trees (200 feet / (4 feet per tree + 10 feet between trees)). The gardener already has 10 trees, so the gardener needs to buy 25 more trees. The cost will be 25 trees * $5/tree = $125.

---

[Example Output]

Explanation:
I miscalculated the total number of trees needed by not accounting for the space between the trees. I divided the total length of the garden by the space required per tree instead of the total space required per tree including the space between trees.

Error Keywords:
- Arithmetic error
- Misinterpretation of spatial requirements
- Incorrect division
- Miscalculation of total items needed

Instructions:
1. Determine the total space required per tree, including the space between trees.
2. Divide the total length of the garden by the total space required per tree to find the number of trees needed.
3. Subtract the number of trees already owned from the total number of trees needed.
4. Multiply the number of trees needed by the cost per tree to find the total cost.

Advice:
- Always consider the space between items when solving problems involving spatial arrangements.
- Double-check calculations to ensure accuracy.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid misinterpretation.

Solution:
The gardener needs to plant 35 trees (200 feet / (4 feet per tree + 10 feet between trees)). The gardener already has 10 trees, so the gardener needs to buy 25 more trees. The cost will be 25 trees * $5/tree = $125.

**Explanation:**
I initially answered the question incorrectly because I did not account for the space between the plants. I simply divided the total length of the flower bed by the width of each plant, which led to an incorrect calculation of the number of plants needed.

**Error Keywords:**
- Arithmetic error
- Misinterpretation of spatial requirements
- Incorrect division
- Miscalculation of total items needed

### Solution

1. **Determine the total space required per plant, including the space between plants:**
   - Each plant requires 3 feet of space.
   - There is an additional 15 feet of space between each plant.
   - Therefore, the total space required per plant is 3 feet + 15 feet = 18 feet.

2. **Calculate the number of plants needed:**
   - The total length of the flower bed is 180 feet.
   - Divide the total length by the total space required per plant: 180 feet / 18 feet per plant = 10 plants.

3. **Subtract the number of plants already owned:**
   - Kimia already owns 11 plants.
   - Since 10 plants are needed and Kimia already has 11, she does not need to buy any more plants.

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Kimia needs to buy 0 more plants.
   - The cost will be 0 plants * ¥3/plant = ¥0.

### Instructions

How long will it take her to peel and saute 90 clams?,30.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Fatima to peel and saute 90 clams. We'll break it down into two parts: peeling and sauteing.

### Peeling Time
Fatima can peel 10 clams per minute. To peel 90 clams, we calculate the time as follows:
\[ \text{Peeling Time} = \frac{\text{Total Clams}}{\text{Peeling Rate}} = \frac{90 \text{ clams}}{10 \text{ clams/minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

### Sauteing Time
Fatima can saute 30 clams in 7 minutes. To find out how many batches of 30 clams are in 90 clams, we divide 90 by 30:
\[ \text{Number of Batches} = \frac{90 \text{ clams}}{30 \text{ clams/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches} \]

Since each batch takes 7 minutes to saute, the total sauteing time is:
\[ \text{Sauteing Time} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 7 \text{ minutes/batch} = 21 \text{ minutes} \]

### Total Time
Now, we add the peeling time and the sauteing time to get the total time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Peeling Time} + \text{Sauteing Time} = 9 \text{ minutes} + 21 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to consider if these tasks can be done simultaneously or sequentially. Since the problem does not specify, we'll assume they are done sequentially for simplicity.

So, the total time to peel and saute 90 clams is the sum of the time to peel and the time to saute:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to saute
- Total time = 9 minutes + 21 minutes = 30 minutes.

1. **Saturday's Pineapples:**
   Oliver picks 219 pineapples.

2. **Sunday's Pineapples:**
   Oliver picks 163 pineapples.

   10 \text{ kgs/day} + 3 \text{ kgs/day} = 13 \text{ kgs/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of ore 20 trolls can mine in one day with titanium pickaxes:**
   If one troll can mine 13 kgs/day, then 20 trolls can mine:
   \[
   20 \times 13 \text{ kgs/day} = 260 \text{ kgs/day}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount of ore 20 trolls can mine in a month with 31 days:**
   \[
   260 \text{ kgs/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 8060 \text{ kgs}
   \]

So, 20 trolls with titanium pickaxes can mine 8060 kgs of ore in a month with 31 days.",31.0,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the amount of ore one troll can mine with a nickel pickaxe:**
   - With bare hands, one troll can mine 5 kgs of ore per day.
   - With a nickel pickaxe, a troll can mine twice as much.
   - So, with a nickel pickaxe, one troll can mine 5 * 2 = 10 kgs of ore per day.

2. **Calculate the amount of ore one troll can mine with a titanium pickaxe:**
   - With a titanium pickaxe, a troll can mine 30% more than with a nickel pickaxe.
   - 30% of 10 kgs is 0.30 * 10 = 3 kgs.
   - So, with a titanium pickaxe, one troll can mine 10 + 3 = 13 kgs of ore per day.

3. **Calculate the amount of ore 20 trolls with titanium pickaxes can mine in one day:**
   - One troll with a titanium pickaxe can mine 13 kgs of ore per day.
   - Therefore, 20 trolls can mine 20 * 13 = 260 kgs of ore per day.

4. **Calculate the amount of ore 20 trolls with titanium pickaxes can mine in a month with 31 days:**
   - 20 trolls can mine 260 kgs of ore per day.
   - In a month with 31 days, they can mine 260 * 31 = 8060 kgs of ore.

Since Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, Kimia will get R + 30 yards.

According to the problem, the total amount of fence they have together is 900 yards. So we can write the equation:

R + (R + 30) = 900

Now, let's solve for R:

2R + 30 = 900

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2R = 900 - 30
2R = 870

Divide both sides by 2:

R = 870 / 2
R = 435

So, Rania gets 435 yards of fence. Since Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, Kimia gets:

435 + 30 = 465 yards

To find out how much is left over for Rania, we need to check if the total adds up to 900 yards:

435 (Rania's share) + 465 (Kimia's share) = 900 yards

Since the total is 900 yards, there is no leftover fence. Rania gets 435 yards, and Kimia gets 465 yards, which adds up to the total 900 yards of fence.",900.0,0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much fence each person gets and then find out how much is left over for Rania.

1. Let's denote the amount of fence Rania gets as \( R \) yards.
2. Since Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, Kimia gets \( R + 30 \) yards.
3. The total amount of fence they have together is 900 yards.
4. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   R + (R + 30) = 900
   \]
5. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   2R + 30 = 900
   \]
6. Subtract 30 from both sides:
   \[
   2R = 870

7. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   R = 435

Question: If Rania and Kimia have 900 yards of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Kimia getting 30 yards more than Rania, how much is left over for Rania?
Your initial answer was: To solve this problem, we need to determine how much fence each person gets and then find out how much is left over for Rania.

1. Let's denote the amount of fence Rania gets as \( R \) yards.
2. Since Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, Kimia gets \( R + 30 \) yards.
3. The total amount of fence they have together is 900 yards.
4. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   R + (R + 30) = 900
   \]
5. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   2R + 30 = 900
   \]
6. Subtract 30 from both sides:
   \[
   2R = 870
   \]
7. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   R = 435
   \]
8. So, Rania gets 435 yards of fence.
9. Since Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, Kimia gets:
   \[
   435 + 30 = 465 \text{ yards}
   \]
10. To find out how much is left over for Rania, we need to check if the total adds up to 900 yards:
    \[

How many hours a week does he spend learning?,42.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Calculate the total minutes Hiroshi spends in class each day:**
   Hiroshi has 7 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it 9 classes per day.
   Each class is 35 minutes long.
   So, the total minutes per day = 9 classes/day * 35 minutes/class = 315 minutes/day

2. **Calculate the total minutes Hiroshi spends in class each week:**
   Hiroshi goes to class for 4 days a week.
   So, the total minutes per week = 315 minutes/day * 4 days/week = 1260 minutes/week

3. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   Hiroshi spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.
   So, the extra learning time per day = (3/6) * 1260 minutes/week = 630 minutes/day

4. **Calculate the total extra learning time for the weekend:**
   Since he spends this amount of time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend = 630 minutes/day * 2 days = 1260 minutes

5. **Calculate the total learning time for the week:**
   Total learning time = Time spent in class + Extra learning time
   Total learning time = 1260 minutes/week + 1260 minutes = 2520 minutes/week

6. **Convert the total learning time from minutes to hours:**
   There are 60 minutes in an hour.

Question: Maria has 5 classes each day, and each class is 40 minutes long. She goes to school for 5 days a week. She then spends one-third of her weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does she spend learning?
Wrong answer: Maria has 5 classes each day, and each class is 40 minutes long. She goes to school for 5 days a week. She then spends one-third of her weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. First, calculate the total minutes spent in class during the week: 5 classes/day * 40 minutes/class * 5 days/week = 1000 minutes/week. Then, calculate the extra learning time: 1000 minutes/week * 1/3 = 333.33 minutes/week. Finally, add the class time and extra learning time: 1000 minutes/week + 333.33 minutes/week = 1333.33 minutes/week. Convert minutes to hours: 1333.33 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 22.22 hours/week. The mistake here is that the extra learning time is calculated incorrectly as one-third of the weekly minutes, but it should be one-third of the daily minutes.

Question: Maria has 5 classes each day, and each class is 40 minutes long. She attends school for 5 days a week. She spends half of her weekly class minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra study time. How many hours a week does she spend in class and studying?
Wrong answer: Maria has 5 classes each day, and each class is 40 minutes long. She attends school for 5 days a week. She spends half of her weekly class minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra study time. First, calculate the total minutes spent in class during the week: 5 classes/day * 40 minutes/class * 5 days/week = 1000 minutes/week. Then, calculate the extra study time: 1000 minutes/week * 1/2 = 500 minutes. Total time spent in class and studying: 1000 minutes + 500 minutes = 1500 minutes. Convert minutes to hours: 1500 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 25 hours. The wrong answer is 25 hours.

He goes to class for 4 days a week. He then spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,42.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Calculate the total minutes Hiroshi spends in class each day:**
   Hiroshi has 7 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it 9 classes per day.
   Each class is 35 minutes long.
   So, the total minutes per day = 9 classes/day * 35 minutes/class = 315 minutes/day

2. **Calculate the total minutes Hiroshi spends in class each week:**
   Hiroshi goes to class for 4 days a week.
   So, the total minutes per week = 315 minutes/day * 4 days/week = 1260 minutes/week

3. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   Hiroshi spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.
   So, the extra learning time per day = (3/6) * 1260 minutes/week = 630 minutes/day

4. **Calculate the total extra learning time for the weekend:**
   Since he spends this amount of time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend = 630 minutes/day * 2 days = 1260 minutes

5. **Calculate the total learning time for the week:**
   Total learning time = Time spent in class + Extra learning time
   Total learning time = 1260 minutes/week + 1260 minutes = 2520 minutes/week

6. **Convert the total learning time from minutes to hours:**
   There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   So, the total learning time in hours = 2520 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 42 hours/week

Therefore, Hiroshi spends 42 hours a week learning.",42.0,1,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Hiroshi spends in class during the week and then add the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday.

1. **Calculate the total number of classes Hiroshi attends per week:**
   - Normal classes per day: 7
   - Extra classes per day: 2
   - Total classes per day: 7 + 2 = 9
   - Days per week: 4
   - Total classes per week: 9 * 4 = 36

2. **Calculate the total minutes spent in class per week:**
   - Minutes per class: 35
   - Total minutes per week: 36 * 35 = 1260

3. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - Total weekly minutes: 1260
   - Fraction of time spent on Saturday and Sunday: 3/6 = 1/2
   - Extra learning time: 1260 * (1/2) = 630

4. **Calculate the total learning time per week:**
   - Total class time: 1260
   - Extra learning time: 630
   - Total learning time: 1260 + 630 = 1890

5. **Convert the total learning time from minutes to hours:**

Wrong answer: Maria has 5 classes each day, and each class is 40 minutes long. She attends school for 5 days a week. She spends half of her weekly class time on homework. First, calculate the total minutes spent in class per day: 5 classes * 40 minutes = 200 minutes. Then, calculate the total minutes spent in class per week: 200 minutes/day * 5 days = 1000 minutes. Since she spends half of her weekly class time on homework, the total time spent on homework is 1000 minutes / 2 = 500 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on school activities is 1000 minutes (classes) + 500 minutes (homework) = 1500 minutes. Convert minutes to hours: 1500 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 25 hours. So, Maria spends 25 hours a week on school activities.

**Explanation:**
I incorrectly calculated the total time Hiroshi spends learning by misinterpreting the fraction of time spent on extra learning and incorrectly converting the total minutes to hours.

**Error Keywords:**
- Time calculation
- Fraction interpretation
- Unit conversion
- Misinterpretation of the problem statement

### Solution:

1. **Calculate the total number of classes Hiroshi attends per day:**
   Hiroshi has 7 regular classes plus 2 extra classes, so he attends 9 classes per day.

2. **Calculate the total minutes spent in class per day:**
   Each class is 35 minutes long, so the total minutes spent in class per day is:
   \[
   9 \text{ classes} \times 35 \text{ minutes/class} = 315 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total minutes spent in class per week:**
   Hiroshi goes to class for 4 days a week, so the total minutes spent in class per week is:
   \[
   315 \text{ minutes/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 1260 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total minutes spent on extra learning:**
   Hiroshi spends three-sixths of his weekly class time on extra learning. Therefore, the total minutes spent on extra learning is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{6} \times 1260 \text{ minutes} = 630 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total minutes spent learning (classes + extra learning):**
   \[
   1260 \text{ minutes (classes)} + 630 \text{ minutes (extra learning)} = 1890 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Convert the total minutes to hours:**
   \[
   1890 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 31.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, Hiroshi spends 31.5 hours a week learning.

If 66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 27-mile walk, in minutes?",90.0,"First, let's find out Emma's walking speed on the beach. Since she walks 11 miles on the beach in 66 minutes, we can calculate her speed as follows:

Speed on the beach = Distance / Time
Speed on the beach = 11 miles / 66 minutes

Now, let's convert the speed to miles per minute for easier calculation:

Speed on the beach = 11 miles / 66 minutes = 1/6 miles per minute

Since Emma walks four times faster on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:

Speed on the sidewalk = 4 * Speed on the beach
Speed on the sidewalk = 4 * (1/6) miles per minute
Speed on the sidewalk = 4/6 miles per minute

Time on the sidewalk = 16 / (2/3)
Time on the sidewalk = 16 * (3/2)
Time on the sidewalk = 24 minutes

   = (27.5 hours / 55 hours) × 100%
   = 0.5 × 100%

1. **Calculate the total time spent cleaning per day:**
   - The cleaner has 110 rooms to clean in 5 days.
   - So, the number of rooms cleaned per day is 110 rooms / 5 days = 22 rooms/day.
   - It takes 15 minutes to clean each room.
   - Therefore, the time spent cleaning per day is 22 rooms/day * 15 minutes/room = 330 minutes/day.

2. **Convert the cleaning time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - So, 330 minutes/day = 330 minutes/day / 60 minutes/hour = 5.5 hours/day.

3. **Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning:**
   - The cleaner works 11 hours each day.
