p2,gsm-symbolic,mistralai/mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501,"Sophia went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, and 60 mini cheesecakes. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes before the discount.

Sophia bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen. Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, she bought 60/12 = 5 dozens of donuts.

The cost of the donuts is 5 dozens * $19/dozen = $95.

Next, she bought 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen. Since there are 12 mini cupcakes in a dozen, she bought 60/12 = 5 dozens of mini cupcakes.

The cost of the mini cupcakes is 5 dozens * $33/dozen = $165.

Now, let's calculate the total cost before the discount for donuts and mini cupcakes:

Total cost for donuts and mini cupcakes = $95 + $165 = $260.

Since Sophia paid $1500 after a 20% discount, let's find out the total cost before the discount.

Let x be the total cost before the discount. After a 20% discount, she paid 80% of the total cost, which is 0.8x.

So, 0.8x = $1500.

To find x, we divide both sides by 0.8:

x = $1500 / 0.8
x = $1875.

This means the total cost before the discount was $1875.

Now, let's find out the cost of the mini cheesecakes. We know the total cost before the discount for donuts and mini cupcakes is $260, so the cost for the mini cheesecakes is:

Cost of mini cheesecakes = Total cost before discount - Cost of donuts and mini cupcakes
Cost of mini cheesecakes = $1875 - $260
Cost of mini cheesecakes = $1615.

Sophia bought 60 mini cheesecakes, which is 60/12 = 5 dozens.

To find the cost per dozen of mini cheesecakes, we divide the total cost of mini cheesecakes by the number of dozens:

Cost per dozen of mini cheesecakes = $1615 / 5 dozens
Cost per dozen of mini cheesecakes = $323.

Therefore, the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is $323.",323.0,1,"To find the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen, we need to first calculate the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes, then subtract that from the total amount paid to find the cost of the mini cheesecakes. Finally, we'll determine the cost per dozen.

1. **Calculate the cost of donuts:**

Question: According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving. A 300 grams bag has 6 servings. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?
Your initial answer was: First, let's calculate the healthy daily calorie target for both Hiroshi and Tara.

For Hiroshi:
- Healthy daily calorie target = 15 calories/pound * 220 lbs = 3300 calories

For Tara:
- Healthy daily calorie target = 15 calories/pound * 140 lbs = 2100 calories

Next, let's calculate how many more calories Hiroshi can consume and how many more Tara can consume.

For Hiroshi:
- Calories remaining = 3300 calories - 1100 calories (already consumed) + 200 calories (burned) = 2400 calories

For Tara:
- Calories remaining = 2100 calories - 900 calories (already consumed) - 200 calories (ice cream) = 1000 calories

Now, let's determine how many servings of popcorn each person can have based on the remaining calories.

For Hiroshi:
- Servings of popcorn = 2400 calories / 200 calories/serving = 12 servings

For Tara:
- Servings of popcorn = 1000 calories / 200 calories/serving = 5 servings

Since each serving is 300 grams, let's calculate the total grams of popcorn each person can have.

For Hiroshi:
- Total grams of popcorn = 12 servings * 300 grams/serving = 3600 grams

For Tara:
- Total grams of popcorn = 5 servings * 300 grams/serving = 1500 grams

Finally, let's find out how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara.

- Difference in grams = 3600 grams (Hiroshi) - 1500 grams (Tara) = 2100 grams

The answer is 2100 grams.

p2,gsm-symbolic,mistralai/mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving. A 300 grams bag has 6 servings. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?",350.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

First, let's calculate the healthy daily calorie target for both Hiroshi and Tara.

For Hiroshi:
220 lbs * 15 calories/lb = 3300 calories

For Tara:
140 lbs * 15 calories/lb = 2100 calories

Next, let's calculate how many calories Hiroshi and Tara have left to consume to reach their healthy daily calorie target.

For Hiroshi:
3300 calories (target) - 1100 calories (consumed) + 200 calories (burned) = 2400 calories left

For Tara:
2100 calories (target) - 900 calories (consumed) - 200 calories (ice cream) = 1000 calories left

Now, let's calculate how many servings of popcorn Hiroshi and Tara can have with the remaining calories.

For Hiroshi:
2400 calories / 200 calories/serving = 12 servings

For Tara:
1000 calories / 200 calories/serving = 5 servings

Since there are 6 servings in a 300 grams bag, let's find out how many grams of popcorn each serving is.

300 grams / 6 servings = 50 grams/serving

Now, let's calculate how many grams of popcorn Hiroshi and Tara can have.

For Hiroshi:
12 servings * 50 grams/serving = 600 grams

For Tara:
5 servings * 50 grams/serving = 250 grams

Finally, let's find out how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara.

600 grams (Hiroshi) - 250 grams (Tara) = 350 grams

Hiroshi needs to consume 350 more grams of popcorn than Tara.",350.0,1,"First, let's calculate the healthy daily calorie target for both Hiroshi and Tara.

For Hiroshi:
- Healthy daily calorie target = 15 calories/pound * 220 lbs = 3300 calories

For Tara:
- Healthy daily calorie target = 15 calories/pound * 140 lbs = 2100 calories

Next, let's calculate how many more calories Hiroshi can consume and how many more Tara can consume.

For Hiroshi:
- Calories remaining = 3300 calories - 1100 calories (already consumed) + 200 calories (burned) = 2400 calories

For Tara:
- Calories remaining = 2100 calories - 900 calories (already consumed) - 200 calories (ice cream) = 1000 calories

Now, let's determine how many servings of popcorn each person can have based on the remaining calories.

For Hiroshi:
- Servings of popcorn = 2400 calories / 200 calories/serving = 12 servings

For Tara:
- Servings of popcorn = 1000 calories / 200 calories/serving = 5 servings

Since each serving is 300 grams, let's calculate the total grams of popcorn each person can have.

For Hiroshi:
- Total grams of popcorn = 12 servings * 300 grams/serving = 3600 grams

For Tara:
- Total grams of popcorn = 5 servings * 300 grams/serving = 1500 grams

Finally, let's find out how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara.

- Difference in grams = 3600 grams (Hiroshi) - 1500 grams (Tara) = 2100 grams

The answer is 2100 grams.",2100.0,0,1.0,0.0,105.0,"--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

Question: A recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and makes 24 cookies. If you want to make 36 cookies, how many cups of flour do you need? Additionally, if each cookie has 150 calories and you have already consumed 800 calories today, how many more calories can you consume if your daily calorie goal is 2000 calories?

Wrong answer: To make 36 cookies, you need 4.5 cups of flour (since 3 cups / 24 cookies = 0.125 cups per cookie, and 0.125 cups * 36 cookies = 4.5 cups). Each cookie has 150 calories, so 36 cookies have 5400 calories. You can consume 1200 more calories (since 2000 - 800 = 1200).

Correct answer: To make 36 cookies, you need 4.5 cups of flour (since 3 cups / 24 cookies = 0.125 cups per cookie, and 0.125 cups * 36 cookies = 4.5 cups). Each cookie has 150 calories, so 36 cookies have 5400 calories. You can consume 1200 more calories (since 2000 - 800 = 1200).

However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city, taking into account the change in wind speed.

First, let's determine the distance that constitutes 1/4 of the city:
1/4 of 80 miles = 80 miles / 4 = 20 miles

Next, we need to calculate the speed of the fog bank before the wind speed is halved. We know that the fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes. Therefore, the speed of the fog bank is:
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 4 miles / 60 minutes = 1/15 miles per minute

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to cover 20 miles at this speed:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 20 miles / (1/15 miles per minute) = 20 * 15 minutes = 300 minutes

However, after 60 minutes, the wind speed is halved, which means the speed of the fog bank will also be halved. The new speed of the fog bank will be:
New Speed = 1/15 miles per minute / 2 = 1/30 miles per minute

Since the fog bank has already been moving for 60 minutes, it has covered 4 miles. Therefore, it has 20 miles - 4 miles = 16 miles left to cover to reach 1/4 of the city.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to cover the remaining 16 miles at the new speed:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 16 miles / (1/30 miles per minute) = 16 * 30 minutes = 480 minutes

However, since the fog bank has already been moving for 60 minutes, we need to add this time to the time it takes to cover the remaining distance:

1. First, determine the distance that constitutes 1/4 of the city:
   - The city is 80 miles across.
   - 1/4 of the city is 80 / 4 = 20 miles.

2. Calculate the initial speed of the fog bank:
   - The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes.
   - Therefore, the speed of the fog bank is 4 miles per 60 minutes, or 4/60 miles per minute.

3. Determine how long it takes to cover the first 20 miles at the initial speed:
   - The fog bank needs to cover 20 miles.
   - At 4/60 miles per minute, the time to cover 20 miles is (20 miles) / (4/60 miles per minute) = 20 * (60/4) minutes = 300 minutes.

4. Since the wind speed is halved after one hour (60 minutes), we need to check if the fog bank will reach 20 miles within the first hour:
   - In the first 60 minutes, the fog bank covers 4 miles.
   - After 60 minutes, the speed is halved, so the new speed is 2/60 miles per minute.

5. Calculate the remaining distance to cover after the first hour:
   - The fog bank has covered 4 miles in the first hour.
   - The remaining distance to cover 1/4 of the city is 20 - 4 = 16 miles.

6. Calculate the time to cover the remaining 16 miles at the halved speed:
   - At 2/60 miles per minute, the time to cover 16 miles is (16 miles) / (2/60 miles per minute) = 16 * (60/2) minutes = 480 minutes.

7. Add the time taken in the first hour to the time taken to cover the remaining distance:
   - Total time = 60 minutes (first hour) + 480 minutes (remaining distance) = 540 minutes.

- The remaining distance to cover 1/4 of the city is 20 - 4 = 16 miles.
- At the halved speed of 2/60 miles per minute, the time to cover 16 miles is (16 miles) / (2/60 miles per minute) = 16 * (60/2) minutes = 480 minutes.

20 hours (total) - 18.5 hours (other days) = 1.5 hours

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute episodes he watched on Thursday. Since each episode is 15 minutes long, we convert 1.5 hours to minutes:

1.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 90 minutes

On Tuesday and Wednesday, he watched 4-hour episodes of his favorite show each night. On Thursday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. On Friday, he finished homework early and watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 2-hour episodes. On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?",6.0,"Let's calculate the total time Santiago spent watching TV from Tuesday to Sunday, excluding Thursday since we don't know that yet.

- Tuesday: 4 hours
- Wednesday: 4 hours
- Friday: 3 hours + 45 minutes
- Saturday: 3 episodes * 2 hours each = 6 hours
- Sunday: 3 episodes * 15 minutes each = 45 minutes

First, let's convert all the time to minutes for easier calculation:

- Tuesday: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes
- Wednesday: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes
- Friday: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 45 minutes = 180 minutes + 45 minutes = 225 minutes
- Saturday: 6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes
- Sunday: 45 minutes

Now, let's add up the minutes from Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:

240 minutes (Tuesday) + 240 minutes (Wednesday) + 225 minutes (Friday) + 360 minutes (Saturday) + 45 minutes (Sunday) = 1110 minutes

Santiago watched 20 hours of TV in total, which is:

20 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1200 minutes

Now, let's find out how many minutes he spent watching TV on Thursday:

1200 minutes (total) - 1110 minutes (Tuesday to Sunday) = 90 minutes

Since each episode on Thursday is 15 minutes long, we can find out how many episodes he watched by dividing the total minutes by the length of each episode:

90 minutes / 15 minutes/episode = 6 episodes

She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, and uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,"Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as S, the number of cups of water as W, the number of tablespoons of milk as M, and the number of tablespoons of heavy cream as C.

From the given information, we have the following ratios:
1. Sugar to water: S:W = 54:27
2. Milk to water: M:W = 8:8
3. Cream to sugar: C:S = 2:54

We can simplify the ratios:
1. S:W = 54:27 simplifies to 2:1 (dividing both sides by 27)
2. M:W = 8:8 simplifies to 1:1 (dividing both sides by 8)
3. C:S = 2:54 simplifies to 1:27 (dividing both sides by 2)

Now, let's express W, M, and C in terms of S using the simplified ratios:
1. W = S/2 (since S:W = 2:1)
2. M = W (since M:W = 1:1, and W = S/2, so M = S/2)
3. C = S/27 (since C:S = 1:27)

The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk used is 240. So we can write the equation:
S + W + M + C = 240

Substitute W, M, and C in terms of S:
S + (S/2) + (S/2) + (S/27) = 240

Combine like terms:
S + S/2 + S/2 + S/27 = 240
(27S + 13.5S + 13.5S + S) / 27 = 240
(55S) / 27 = 240

Ravi can harvest his bananas every 4 months. In addition, Ravi owns a 13-square yard apricot field that produces 12 apricots per square yard. The apricots can be harvested every 4 months. In the span of two years, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?",1764.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

**Banana Field:**

1. First, we need to find out how many bananas are produced per square yard.
   - We know that there are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard.
   - So, to find out how many bananas are in a full square yard, we divide 36 by 4/5 (or 0.8):
     \[
     \text{Bananas per square yard} = \frac{36}{0.8} = 45 \text{ bananas}
     \]

2. Next, we calculate the total number of bananas produced in 10 square yards:
   - Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field.
   - So, the total number of bananas is:
     \[
     \text{Total bananas} = 10 \times 45 = 450 \text{ bananas}
     \]

3. Now, we determine how many times Ravi can harvest in two years (24 months):
   - Ravi can harvest every 4 months.
   - So, the number of harvests in two years is:
     \[
     \text{Number of harvests} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ times}
     \]

4. Finally, we calculate the total number of bananas harvested in two years:
   - The total number of bananas harvested is:
     \[
     \text{Total bananas in two years} = 450 \times 6 = 2700 \text{ bananas}
     \]

**Apricot Field:**

1. We calculate the total number of apricots produced in 13 square yards:
   - Ravi has 13 square yards of apricot field.
   - Each square yard produces 12 apricots.
   - So, the total number of apricots is:
     \[
     \text{Total apricots} = 13 \times 12 = 156 \text{ apricots}
     \]

2. We determine how many times Ravi can harvest in two years (24 months):
   - Ravi can harvest every 4 months.
   - So, the number of harvests in two years is:
     \[
     \text{Number of harvests} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ times}
     \]

3. Finally, we calculate the total number of apricots harvested in two years:
   - The total number of apricots harvested is:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of bananas per square yard.**
Ravi has 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard. To find out how many bananas are in one square yard, we divide 36 by 4/5:
\[ \text{Bananas per square yard} = \frac{36}{\frac{4}{5}} = 36 \times \frac{5}{4} = 45 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of bananas in 10 square yards.**
\[ \text{Total bananas} = 45 \times 10 = 450 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of banana harvests in two years.**
Since Ravi can harvest bananas every 4 months, he can do so 6 times in two years (24 months / 4 months per harvest).
\[ \text{Total banana harvests in two years} = 450 \times 6 = 2700 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of apricots per square yard.**

In the span of two years, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?",1764.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

**Banana Field:**

1. First, we need to find out how many bananas are produced per square yard.
   - We know that there are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard.
   - So, to find out how many bananas are in a full square yard, we divide 36 by 4/5 (or 0.8):
     \[
     \text{Bananas per square yard} = \frac{36}{0.8} = 45 \text{ bananas}

   - Ravi can harvest every 4 months.
   - So, the number of harvests in two years is:
     \[
     \text{Number of harvests} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ times}

Question: A fair six-sided die is rolled three times. What is the probability of rolling an odd number at least once?
Wrong answer: The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is 1/2. Therefore, the probability of rolling an odd number at least once in three rolls is 3/2, which is incorrect because probabilities cannot exceed 1.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I incorrectly added the probabilities of independent events instead of using the complement rule to find the probability of the opposite event (not rolling an odd number at all) and subtracting from 1.
Error Keywords:
- Probability
- Independent events
- Complement rule
- Addition of probabilities
Instructions:
1. Identify the probability of the complementary event (not rolling an odd number at all).
2. Calculate the probability of not rolling an odd number in a single roll (1/2).
3. Raise this probability to the power of the number of rolls (3 in this case).
4. Subtract the result from 1 to find the probability of rolling an odd number at least once.
Solution:
The probability of not rolling an odd number in a single roll is 1/2. Therefore, the probability of not rolling an odd number in three rolls is (1/2)^3 = 1/8. The probability of rolling an odd number at least once is 1 - 1/8 = 7/8 or 87.5%.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Mia went to her greenhouse to pick some blueberries and found 2/3 as many beetles as bees in the plot. Mia then found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. In addition, she saw 24 wasps, and 9 bees. What percentage of animals in the plot were rabbits?
Your initial answer was: To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of animals and then find out how many of them are rabbits. Finally, we'll calculate the percentage of rabbits.

1. **Calculate the number of rabbits:**
   Mia found 26 white animals, and half of them were rabbits.
   So, the number of rabbits is 26 / 2 = 13.

2. **Calculate the number of beetles:**
   Mia found 2/3 as many beetles as bees. She saw 9 bees.
   So, the number of beetles is (2/3) * 9 = 6.

3. **Calculate the total number of animals:**
   We have the number of rabbits (13), wasps (24), bees (9), and beetles (6).
   So, the total number of animals is 13 + 24 + 9 + 6 = 52.

4. **Calculate the percentage of rabbits:**
   The percentage of rabbits is (number of rabbits / total number of animals) * 100.
   So, the percentage of rabbits is (13 / 52) * 100 = 25%.

The answer is 25%.

   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ beetles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of animals:**
   Mia saw 13 rabbits, 6 beetles, 24 wasps, and 9 bees. So, the total number of animals is:
   \[
   13 + 6 + 24 + 9 = 52 \text{ animals}
   \]

4. **Calculate the percentage of animals that were rabbits:**
   To find the percentage of rabbits, we divide the number of rabbits by the total number of animals and multiply by 100:
   \[
   \frac{13}{52} \times 100 = 25\%
   \]

So, 25% of the animals in the plot were rabbits.",25.0,0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of animals and then find out how many of them are rabbits. Finally, we'll calculate the percentage of rabbits.

1. **Calculate the number of rabbits:**
   Mia found 26 white animals, and half of them were rabbits.
   So, the number of rabbits is 26 / 2 = 13.

2. **Calculate the number of beetles:**
   Mia found 2/3 as many beetles as bees. She saw 9 bees.
   So, the number of beetles is (2/3) * 9 = 6.

3. **Calculate the total number of animals:**
   We have the number of rabbits (13), wasps (24), bees (9), and beetles (6).
   So, the total number of animals is 13 + 24 + 9 + 6 = 52.

4. **Calculate the percentage of rabbits:**
   The percentage of rabbits is (number of rabbits / total number of animals) * 100.
   So, the percentage of rabbits is (13 / 52) * 100 = 25%.

[Example Input]
Question: A farmer counted 3/4 as many chickens as ducks in his farmyard. He also found 30 black animals, three-quarters of which were cats. Additionally, he saw 18 sparrows and 12 ducks. What percentage of animals in the farmyard were cats?
Wrong answer: The farmer has 22.5 cats, 30 black animals, 18 sparrows, and 12 ducks, making a total of 82.5 animals. The percentage of cats is (22.5/82.5) * 100 = 27.27%. The mistake here is that the number of cats should be a whole number, and the total number of animals should also be a whole number.

- Total count calculation
- Percentage calculation
Instructions:
1. Identify the total number of black animals and determine the number of cats by considering that the number of cats should be a whole number.
2. Calculate the total number of animals by adding the number of cats, the number of other black animals, the number of sparrows, and the number of ducks.
3. Calculate the percentage of cats by dividing the number of cats by the total number of animals and multiplying by 100.
Advice:

- Be careful when converting fractions to whole numbers.
Solution:
The farmer has 22.5 cats, 30 black animals, 18 sparrows, and 12 ducks, making a total of 82.5 animals. The percentage of cats is (22.5/82.5) * 100 = 27.27%. The mistake here is that the number of cats should be a whole number, and the total number of animals should also be a whole number. The correct number of cats is 22 (since 3/4 of 30 is 22.5, but we need a whole number). The total number of animals is 82 (22 cats + 8 other black animals + 18 sparrows + 12 ducks). The correct percentage of cats is (22/82) * 100 = 26.83%.

Question: Mrs. Lee is looking for a new townhouse that will not go beyond her $340000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $400000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?
Your initial answer was: First, let's calculate the discounted selling price for Mrs. Lee.

The discount amount is 25% of $400,000:
0.25 * $400,000 = $100,000

So, the discounted selling price is:
$400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the original selling price:
0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

Now, let's calculate the transfer fee, which is 12% of the original selling price:
0.12 * $400,000 = $48,000

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Discounted selling price: $300,000
Brokerage fee: $20,000
Transfer fee: $48,000

Total cost = $300,000 + $20,000 + $48,000 = $368,000

Finally, let's find out how much more this is than Mrs. Lee's budget of $340,000:
$368,000 - $340,000 = $28,000

The total cost is $28,000 more than Mrs. Lee's budget.

","### Reflection

**Explanation:**
I incorrectly calculated the total cost by not considering that the brokerage fee and transfer fee should be based on the discounted selling price, not the original selling price. This led to an overestimation of the total cost.

**Error Keywords:**
- Calculation error
- Arithmetic error
- Misinterpretation of problem conditions
- Incorrect application of percentages
- Miscalculation of fees based on incorrect base value

### Corrected Solution

1. **Calculate the discounted selling price:**
   - The discount amount is 25% of $400,000:
     \[
     0.25 \times 400,000 = 100,000
     \]
   - So, the discounted selling price is:
     \[
     400,000 - 100,000 = 300,000
     \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee based on the discounted selling price:**
   - The brokerage fee is 5% of the discounted selling price:
     \[
     0.05 \times 300,000 = 15,000
     \]

3. **Calculate the transfer fee based on the discounted selling price:**
   - The transfer fee is 12% of the discounted selling price:
     \[
     0.12 \times 300,000 = 36,000
     \]

4. **Add up all the costs:**
   - Discounted selling price: $300,000
   - Brokerage fee: $15,000
   - Transfer fee: $36,000
   - Total cost:
     \[
     300,000 + 15,000 + 36,000 = 351,000
     \]

5. **Find out how much more this is than Mrs. Lee's budget of $340,000:**
   \[
   351,000 - 340,000 = 11,000
   \]

The total cost is $11,000 more than Mrs. Lee's budget.

[Example Input]

Question: Mr. Smith is looking for a new car that will not go beyond his $25,000 budget. He saw a car that has a selling price of $30,000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a sales tax which is 8% of the selling price, and also a registration fee that is 3% of the selling price. If Mr. Smith can get a 20% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mr. Smith's budget?

Wrong answer: Mr. Smith's total cost will be $2,000 more than his budget. I calculated the discount as 20% of $30,000, which is $6,000. Then, I subtracted this from the selling price to get $24,000. Next, I calculated the sales tax as 8% of $24,000, which is $1,920, and the registration fee as 3% of $24,000, which is $720. I added these to the discounted price to get a total cost of $26,640. I then subtracted Mr. Smith's budget of $25,000 to find the difference.

[Example Output]

Explanation:
I miscalculated the discount and the additional fees. I should have applied the discount to the selling price before calculating the sales tax and registration fee.

Error Keywords:
- Percentage calculations
- Order of operations in financial calculations
- Discount application
- Tax and fee calculations

Instructions:
1. Calculate the discount on the selling price.
2. Subtract the discount from the selling price to get the discounted price.
3. Calculate the sales tax as a percentage of the discounted price.
4. Calculate the registration fee as a percentage of the discounted price.
5. Add the sales tax and registration fee to the discounted price to get the total cost.
6. Subtract the budget from the total cost to find the difference.

Advice:
- Always apply discounts before calculating additional fees and taxes.
- Double-check the order of operations in financial calculations.
- Be mindful of the base amount when calculating percentages.

Solution:
1. Calculate the discount: 20% of $30,000 = $6,000.
2. Subtract the discount from the selling price: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.
3. Calculate the sales tax: 8% of $24,000 = $1,920.
4. Calculate the registration fee: 3% of $24,000 = $720.
5. Add the sales tax and registration fee to the discounted price: $24,000 + $1,920 + $720 = $26,640.
6. Subtract the budget from the total cost: $26,640 - $25,000 = $1,640.

Mr. Smith's total cost will be $1,640 more than his budget.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Reflection

**Explanation:**
I miscalculated the discount and the additional fees. I should have applied the discount to the selling price before calculating the brokerage fee and transfer fee.

**Error Keywords:**
- Percentage calculations
- Order of operations in financial calculations
- Discount application
- Fee calculations

### Corrected Solution

1. **Calculate the discount on the selling price:**
   - Discount = 25% of $400,000
   - Discount = 0.25 * $400,000 = $100,000

2. **Subtract the discount from the selling price to get the discounted price:**
   - Discounted price = $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000

3. **Calculate the brokerage fee as a percentage of the discounted price:**
   - Brokerage fee = 5% of $300,000
   - Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $300,000 = $15,000

4. **Calculate the transfer fee as a percentage of the discounted price:**
   - Transfer fee = 12% of $300,000
   - Transfer fee = 0.12 * $300,000 = $36,000

5. **Add the brokerage fee and transfer fee to the discounted price to get the total cost:**
   - Total cost = $300,000 + $15,000 + $36,000 = $351,000

6. **Subtract the budget from the total cost to find the difference:**
   - Difference = $351,000 - $340,000 = $11,000

Mrs. Lee's total cost will be $11,000 more than her budget.

### Instructions for Future Problems

1. **Calculate the discount on the selling price.**
2. **Subtract the discount from the selling price to get the discounted price.**
3. **Calculate the brokerage fee as a percentage of the discounted price.**
4. **Calculate the transfer fee as a percentage of the discounted price.**
5. **Add the brokerage fee and transfer fee to the discounted price to get the total cost.**

Question: Priya went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her ₺1200 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, fudge was on sale for ""Buy 15 kgs at ₺22 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/4 off."" She scooped up 21 kgs. She also bought a mixed bag of sand dollars for ₺11.0 and 12 postcards that were ₺21.0 each. Priya then donated ₺5 at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Priya have left?
Your initial answer was: First, let's calculate the cost of the fudge. Priya bought 21 kgs of fudge. The first 15 kgs are at the full price of ₺22 per kg, and the remaining 6 kgs are at a 1/4 off discount.

The cost for the first 15 kgs is:
15 kgs * ₺22/kg = ₺330

The discount for the remaining 6 kgs is 1/4 off of ₺22, which is:
₺22 * 1/4 = ₺5.5

So, the discounted price per kg for the remaining 6 kgs is:
₺22 - ₺5.5 = ₺16.5

The cost for the remaining 6 kgs is:
6 kgs * ₺16.5/kg = ₺99

The total cost for the fudge is:
₺330 + ₺99 = ₺429

Next, let's calculate the cost of the other items:
- Mixed bag of sand dollars: ₺11.0
- 12 postcards at ₺21.0 each: 12 * ₺21.0 = ₺252

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
Fudge: ₺429
Sand dollars: ₺11.0
Postcards: ₺252
Charity donation: ₺5

Total expenses = ₺429 + ₺11.0 + ₺252 + ₺5 = ₺697

Priya started with ₺1200, so the money she has left is:
₺1200 - ₺697 = ₺503

The answer is ₺503.

","### Reflection

**Explanation:**
I incorrectly calculated the total cost of the fudge. Specifically, I misinterpreted the discount offer and incorrectly applied the discount to the remaining 6 kgs of fudge. I also made an error in calculating the total cost of the postcards.

**Error Keywords:**
- Calculation error
- Misinterpretation of discount offer
- Arithmetic error
- Multiplication error

### Corrected Solution

1. **Calculate the cost of the fudge:**
   - Priya bought 21 kgs of fudge.
   - The first 15 kgs are at the full price of ₺22 per kg.
   - The remaining 6 kgs are at a 1/4 off discount.

   The cost for the first 15 kgs is:
   \[
   15 \text{ kgs} \times ₺22/\text{kg} = ₺330
   \]

   The discount for the remaining 6 kgs is 1/4 off of ₺22, which is:
   \[
   ₺22 \times \frac{1}{4} = ₺5.5
   \]

   So, the discounted price per kg for the remaining 6 kgs is:
   \[
   ₺22 - ₺5.5 = ₺16.5
   \]

   The cost for the remaining 6 kgs is:
   \[
   6 \text{ kgs} \times ₺16.5/\text{kg} = ₺99
   \]

   The total cost for the fudge is:
   \[
   ₺330 + ₺99 = ₺429
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the other items:**
   - Mixed bag of sand dollars: ₺11.0
   - 12 postcards at ₺21.0 each:
   \[
   12 \times ₺21.0 = ₺252
   \]

3. **Add up all the expenses:**
   - Fudge: ₺429
   - Sand dollars: ₺11.0
   - Postcards: ₺252
   - Charity donation: ₺5

   Total expenses:
   \[
   ₺429 + ₺11.0 + ₺252 + ₺5 = ₺697
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining money:**
   Priya started with ₺1200, so the money she has left is:
   \[
   ₺1200 - ₺697 = ₺503
   \]

The answer is ₺503.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the other items:
- Mixed bag of sand dollars: ₺11.0
- 12 postcards at ₺21.0 each: 12 * ₺21.0 = ₺252

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
Fudge: ₺429
Sand dollars: ₺11.0
Postcards: ₺252
Charity donation: ₺5

Total expenses = ₺429 + ₺11.0 + ₺252 + ₺5 = ₺697

She scooped up 21 kgs. She also bought a mixed bag of sand dollars for ₺11.0 and 12 postcards that were ₺21.0 each. Priya then donated ₺5 at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Priya have left?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 503.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Reflection

**Explanation:**
I miscalculated the discount on the additional 4 kgs of fudge by not applying the 1/4 off discount to the correct price. Additionally, I did not account for the correct number of postcards and their total cost.

**Error Keywords:**
- Discount calculation
- Multiple transactions
- Incorrect subtraction
- Misinterpretation of quantities

### Solution:

1. **Calculate the cost of the fudge:**
   - Priya bought 21 kgs of fudge.
   - The first 15 kgs cost ₺22 per kg.
   - The remaining 6 kgs are subject to a 1/4 off discount.
   - Cost of 15 kgs: 15 kgs * ₺22/kg = ₺330
   - Cost of 6 kgs with discount: 6 kgs * ₺22/kg = ₺132
   - Discount on 4 kgs: 4 kgs * ₺22/kg * 1/4 = ₺22
   - Cost of 4 kgs with discount: ₺132 - ₺22 = ₺110
   - Total cost of fudge: ₺330 + ₺110 = ₺440

2. **Calculate the cost of the sand dollars:**
   - Cost of sand dollars: ₺11.0

3. **Calculate the cost of the postcards:**
   - Cost per postcard: ₺21.0
   - Total cost for 12 postcards: 12 * ₺21.0 = ₺252

4. **Calculate the donation:**
   - Donation: ₺5

5. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Total spent: ₺440 (fudge) + ₺11.0 (sand dollars) + ₺252 (postcards) + ₺5 (donation) = ₺708

6. **Calculate the money left:**
   - Money left: ₺1200 - ₺708 = ₺492

### Instructions:

1. Identify all items and their prices.
2. Calculate the total cost of items without discounts.
3. Apply discounts correctly to the items.
4. Subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money.
5. Ensure all transactions are accounted for.
6. Double-check the quantities and prices of each item.

### Advice:

- Always double-check discount calculations.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps.
- Ensure all items and transactions are accounted for.
- Be mindful of the order of operations in calculations.
- Verify the quantities and prices of each item to avoid misinterpretation.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

What percentage of all the puppies have spots?",90.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

First, let's find out how many puppies have spots after Jamal's visit to the vet.

Jamal's dog originally has 23 spotted puppies. The number of unspotted puppies is 131 - 23 = 108.

After the vet visit, half of these unspotted puppies are found to have spots. So, the number of newly spotted puppies is 108 / 2 = 54.

Now, the total number of spotted puppies Jamal has is 23 (originally spotted) + 54 (newly spotted) = 77.

Next, let's calculate the total number of puppies and the total number of spotted puppies for all three individuals.

Jamal's total puppies = 131
Gabriel's total puppies = 47
Yuki's total puppies = 54 * 13 = 702 (since each of Yuki's 54 dogs has 13 puppies with spots)

Total puppies = 131 (Jamal) + 47 (Gabriel) + 702 (Yuki) = 880

Total spotted puppies = 77 (Jamal) + 13 (Gabriel) + 702 (Yuki) = 792

Now, to find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we use the formula:

Percentage of spotted puppies = (Total spotted puppies / Total puppies) * 100

p2,gsm-symbolic,mistralai/mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501,"A farmer is buying feed for his pigs. He buys a variety of hay, corn, cucumbers and apples. Since apples are a rare treat, he only buys four 3-kg boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys twelve 6-kg bags. Hay are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys thirty four 39-kg packs. Corn are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 17-kg sacks. Finally, he buys 43 kgs of groceries, and 27 kgs of tools, and 100 kgs of wood. A farm truck can carry 160 kgs at a time. If the farmer has three trucks, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the purchased items?",4.0,"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to make, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the items he has purchased. Then, we'll divide that total by the capacity of one truck and see how many trips are needed.

1. **Calculate the total weight of each type of item:**

   - Apples: \(4 \text{ boxes} \times 3 \text{ kg/box} = 12 \text{ kg}\)
   - Cucumbers: \(12 \text{ bags} \times 6 \text{ kg/bag} = 72 \text{ kg}\)
   - Hay: \(34 \text{ packs} \times 39 \text{ kg/pack} = 1326 \text{ kg}\)
   - Corn: \(20 \text{ sacks} \times 17 \text{ kg/sack} = 340 \text{ kg}\)
   - Groceries: \(43 \text{ kg}\)
   - Tools: \(27 \text{ kg}\)
   - Wood: \(100 \text{ kg}\)

2. **Sum the total weight of all items:**

   \[
   12 \text{ kg (apples)} + 72 \text{ kg (cucumbers)} + 1326 \text{ kg (hay)} + 340 \text{ kg (corn)} + 43 \text{ kg (groceries)} + 27 \text{ kg (tools)} + 100 \text{ kg (wood)} = 1920 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of trips needed:**

   Each truck can carry 160 kg at a time. The farmer has three trucks, so the total capacity per trip is:

   \[
   3 \text{ trucks} \times 160 \text{ kg/truck} = 480 \text{ kg/trip}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of trips:**

   \[
   \frac{1920 \text{ kg}}{480 \text{ kg/trip}} = 4 \text{ trips}
   \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make **4 trips** to transport all the purchased items.",4.0,1,"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the purchased items, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the items.

2. **Calculate the total weight of cucumbers:**
   - Twelve 6-kg bags of cucumbers.
   - Total weight of cucumbers = 12 * 6 = 72 kg.

3. **Calculate the total weight of hay:**
   - Thirty-four 39-kg packs of hay.
   - Total weight of hay = 34 * 39 = 1326 kg.

4. **Calculate the total weight of corn:**
   - Twenty 17-kg sacks of corn.
   - Total weight of corn = 20 * 17 = 340 kg.

5. **Calculate the total weight of groceries, tools, and wood:**
   - 43 kg of groceries.
   - 27 kg of tools.
   - 100 kg of wood.
   - Total weight of groceries, tools, and wood = 43 + 27 + 100 = 170 kg.

6. **Calculate the total weight of all items:**
   - Total weight = weight of apples + weight of cucumbers + weight of hay + weight of corn + weight of groceries, tools, and wood.
   - Total weight = 12 + 72 + 1326 + 340 + 170 = 1920 kg.

How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?",14.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Calculate the capacity of each table:**
   Each table can hold three times the amount of almonds as a bowl. Since each bowl holds 24 almonds, each table can hold:
   \[
   3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ almonds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the tables before any break:**
   Carlos has 3 tables, so the total capacity of the tables is:
   \[
   3 \times 72 = 216 \text{ almonds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls:**
   Carlos has 7 bowls, so the total capacity of the bowls is:
   \[
   7 \times 24 = 168 \text{ almonds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total capacity of all containers before any break:**
   The total capacity of the bowls and tables is:
   \[
   216 + 168 = 384 \text{ almonds}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining almonds after placing them in the containers:**
   Carlos has 720 almonds, so after placing them in the containers, the remaining almonds are:
   \[
   720 - 384 = 336 \text{ almonds}
   \]

6. **Calculate the number of almonds Carlos eats:**
   Carlos eats one-fifth of all the almonds, so he eats:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 720 = 144 \text{ almonds}
   \]

7. **Calculate the remaining almonds after Carlos eats some:**
   After eating 144 almonds, the remaining almonds are:
   \[
   720 - 144 = 576 \text{ almonds}
   \]

8. **Calculate the capacity of the remaining tables after 2 break:**
   Since 2 tables break, the remaining capacity of the tables is:
   \[
   1 \times 72 = 72 \text{ almonds}

4. **Calculate the number of almonds left after Carlos eats one-fifth:**
   Carlos eats one-fifth of all the almonds.
   So, he eats 720 / 5 = 144 almonds.
   The number of almonds left is 720 - 144 = 576 almonds.

   Carlos has 7 bowls and 3 tables.
   The total capacity of the bowls is 7 * 24 = 168 almonds.
   The total capacity of the tables is 3 * 72 = 216 almonds.
   So, the total capacity before any break is 168 + 216 = 384 almonds.

3. **Calculate the total capacity after 2 tables break:**
   Since 2 tables break, the remaining capacity from the tables is 1 * 72 = 72 almonds.
   So, the total capacity after the break is 168 (from bowls) + 72 (from the remaining table) = 240 almonds.

4. **Calculate the number of almonds left after Carlos eats one-fifth:**
   Carlos eats one-fifth of all the almonds.
   So, he eats 720 / 5 = 144 almonds.
   The number of almonds left is 720 - 144 = 576 almonds.

5. **Calculate the number of additional bowls needed:**
   Carlos has 7 bowls, which can hold 168 almonds.
   The remaining almonds that need to be placed are 576 - 168 = 408 almonds.
   Each bowl can hold 24 almonds, so the number of additional bowls needed is 408 / 24 = 17 bowls.

The answer is 17.

","### Reflection

**Explanation:**
I incorrectly calculated the number of additional bowls needed after Carlos eats one-fifth of the almonds. The error was in the final step where I subtracted the capacity of the existing bowls from the remaining almonds before determining the number of additional bowls needed.

**Error Keywords:**
- Calculation error
- Arithmetic error
- Subtraction error
- Misinterpretation of remaining capacity

### Corrected Solution

1. **Calculate the capacity of each table:**
   Each table can hold three times the number of almonds as a bowl.
   So, each table can hold 24 * 3 = 72 almonds.

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and tables before any break:**
   Carlos has 7 bowls and 3 tables.
   The total capacity of the bowls is 7 * 24 = 168 almonds.
   The total capacity of the tables is 3 * 72 = 216 almonds.
   So, the total capacity before any break is 168 + 216 = 384 almonds.

3. **Calculate the total capacity after 2 tables break:**
   Since 2 tables break, the remaining capacity from the tables is 1 * 72 = 72 almonds.
   So, the total capacity after the break is 168 (from bowls) + 72 (from the remaining table) = 240 almonds.

4. **Calculate the number of almonds left after Carlos eats one-fifth:**
   Carlos eats one-fifth of all the almonds.
   So, he eats 720 / 5 = 144 almonds.
   The number of almonds left is 720 - 144 = 576 almonds.

5. **Calculate the number of additional bowls needed:**
   Carlos has 7 bowls, which can hold 168 almonds.
   The remaining almonds that need to be placed are 576 almonds.
   Each bowl can hold 24 almonds, so the number of additional bowls needed is (576 - 168) / 24 = 408 / 24 = 17 bowls.

The answer is 17.

Carlos has 720 almonds, 7 bowls and 3 tables. Unfortunately, 2 tables break. Carlos then eats one-fifth of all the almonds. How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?",14.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Calculate the capacity of each table:**
   Each table can hold three times the amount of almonds as a bowl. Since each bowl holds 24 almonds, each table can hold:
   \[
   3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ almonds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the tables before any break:**
   Carlos has 3 tables, so the total capacity of the tables is:
   \[
   3 \times 72 = 216 \text{ almonds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls:**
   Carlos has 7 bowls, so the total capacity of the bowls is:
   \[
   7 \times 24 = 168 \text{ almonds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total capacity of all containers before any break:**
   The total capacity of the bowls and tables is:
   \[
   216 + 168 = 384 \text{ almonds}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining almonds after placing them in the containers:**
   Carlos has 720 almonds, so after placing them in the containers, the remaining almonds are:
   \[
   720 - 384 = 336 \text{ almonds}
   \]

6. **Calculate the number of almonds Carlos eats:**
   Carlos eats one-fifth of all the almonds, so he eats:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 720 = 144 \text{ almonds}
   \]

7. **Calculate the remaining almonds after Carlos eats some:**
   After eating 144 almonds, the remaining almonds are:
   \[
   720 - 144 = 576 \text{ almonds}
   \]

8. **Calculate the capacity of the remaining tables after 2 break:**
   Since 2 tables break, the remaining capacity of the tables is:
   \[
   1 \times 72 = 72 \text{ almonds}
   \]

9. **Calculate the total capacity of the remaining containers:**
   The total capacity of the remaining bowls and tables is:
   \[
   168 + 72 = 240 \text{ almonds}
   \]

10. **Calculate the remaining almonds after placing them in the remaining containers:**
    After placing the remaining almonds in the remaining containers, the remaining almonds are:
    \[
    576 - 240 = 336 \text{ almonds}
    \]

11. **Calculate the number of additional bowls needed:**
    Each bowl can hold 24 almonds, so the number of additional bowls needed is:
    \[
    \frac{336}{24} = 14 \text{ bowls}
    \]

Therefore, Carlos needs 14 more bowls to place all the remaining almonds.",14.0,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the capacity of each table:**
   Each table can hold three times the number of almonds as a bowl.
   So, each table can hold 24 * 3 = 72 almonds.

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and tables before any break:**
   Carlos has 7 bowls and 3 tables.
   The total capacity of the bowls is 7 * 24 = 168 almonds.
   The total capacity of the tables is 3 * 72 = 216 almonds.
   So, the total capacity before any break is 168 + 216 = 384 almonds.

3. **Calculate the total capacity after 2 tables break:**
   Since 2 tables break, the remaining capacity from the tables is 1 * 72 = 72 almonds.
   So, the total capacity after the break is 168 (from bowls) + 72 (from the remaining table) = 240 almonds.

4. **Calculate the number of almonds left after Carlos eats one-fifth:**
   Carlos eats one-fifth of all the almonds.
   So, he eats 720 / 5 = 144 almonds.
   The number of almonds left is 720 - 144 = 576 almonds.

5. **Calculate the number of additional bowls needed:**
   Carlos has 7 bowls, which can hold 168 almonds.
   The remaining almonds that need to be placed are 576 - 168 = 408 almonds.
   Each bowl can hold 24 almonds, so the number of additional bowls needed is 408 / 24 = 17 bowls.

[Example Input]

Question: Maria places apples in baskets and crates. Each basket can hold 15 apples, while each crate can hold twice that amount. Maria has 450 apples, 5 baskets, and 4 crates. Unfortunately, 1 crate breaks. Maria then eats one-fourth of all the apples. How many more baskets does Maria need so she can place all the remaining apples?

Wrong answer: Maria initially has 450 apples. Each basket holds 15 apples, and each crate holds 30 apples. With 5 baskets and 4 crates, she can hold 5 * 15 + 4 * 30 = 75 + 120 = 195 apples. After one crate breaks, she can hold 5 * 15 + 3 * 30 = 75 + 90 = 165 apples. Maria eats one-fourth of the apples, leaving 450 - 112.5 = 337.5 apples. She needs 337.5 / 15 = 22.5 baskets, so she needs 22.5 - 5 = 17.5 more baskets. However, since she can't have half a basket, she needs 18 more baskets.

Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of apples Maria can hold after one crate breaks and incorrectly rounded the number of apples left after Maria eats some.

Error Keywords:
- Arithmetic error
- Incorrect rounding
- Miscalculation of remaining capacity
- Incorrect distribution calculation

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total capacity of the baskets and crates before any break.
2. Recalculate the total capacity after accounting for the broken crate.
3. Determine the number of apples left after Maria eats one-fourth.
4. Calculate the number of additional baskets needed based on the remaining apples and the capacity of each basket.
5. Ensure the final answer is a whole number since you can't have a fraction of a basket.

Advice:
- Double-check arithmetic calculations, especially when dealing with fractions and remainders.
- Be mindful of the capacity changes when items are broken or removed.
- Ensure the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem (e.g., whole numbers for physical items).

**Explanation:**
I miscalculated the number of almonds Carlos can hold after two tables break and incorrectly rounded the number of almonds left after Carlos eats some.

**Error Keywords:**
- Arithmetic error
- Incorrect rounding
- Miscalculation of remaining capacity
- Incorrect distribution calculation

### Corrected Solution

1. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and tables before any break:**
   - Each bowl holds 24 almonds.
   - Each table holds 3 times that, so each table holds 24 * 3 = 72 almonds.
   - Carlos has 7 bowls and 3 tables.
   - Total capacity = (7 bowls * 24 almonds/bowl) + (3 tables * 72 almonds/table)
   - Total capacity = (7 * 24) + (3 * 72) = 168 + 216 = 384 almonds.

2. **Recalculate the total capacity after accounting for the broken tables:**
   - After 2 tables break, Carlos has 1 table left.
   - Total capacity = (7 bowls * 24 almonds/bowl) + (1 table * 72 almonds/table)
   - Total capacity = (7 * 24) + (1 * 72) = 168 + 72 = 240 almonds.

3. **Determine the number of almonds left after Carlos eats one-fifth:**
   - Carlos eats one-fifth of 720 almonds, which is 720 / 5 = 144 almonds.
   - Remaining almonds = 720 - 144 = 576 almonds.

4. **Calculate the number of additional bowls needed based on the remaining almonds and the capacity of each bowl:**
   - Each bowl holds 24 almonds.
   - Number of bowls needed = 576 almonds / 24 almonds/bowl = 24 bowls.
   - Carlos already has 7 bowls, so he needs 24 - 7 = 17 more bowls.

### Instructions

1. Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and tables before any break.
2. Recalculate the total capacity after accounting for the broken tables.
3. Determine the number of almonds left after Carlos eats one-fifth.
4. Calculate the number of additional bowls needed based on the remaining almonds and the capacity of each bowl.

   - Each table can hold 3 times that amount, so each table can hold 24 * 3 = 72 almonds.

2. **Determine the total number of almonds that can be held initially:**
   - Carlos has 7 bowls, so they can hold 7 * 24 = 168 almonds.
   - Carlos has 3 tables, so they can hold 3 * 72 = 216 almonds.
   - Therefore, initially, Carlos can hold 168 + 216 = 384 almonds.

3. **Account for the broken tables:**
   - After 2 tables break, Carlos can hold 1 * 72 = 72 almonds in the remaining table.

4. **Calculate the number of almonds remaining after Carlos eats one-fifth:**
   - Carlos eats one-fifth of 720 almonds, which is 720 / 5 = 144 almonds.
   - Therefore, Carlos has 720 - 144 = 576 almonds left.

5. **Determine how many more bowls are needed to hold the remaining almonds:**
   - Carlos can already hold 168 almonds in the 7 bowls and 72 almonds in the 1 remaining table, so he can hold 168 + 72 = 240 almonds.
   - Therefore, he needs to place 576 - 240 = 336 almonds in additional bowls.
   - Since each bowl holds 24 almonds, he needs 336 / 24 = 14 more bowls.

### Instructions:

1. Calculate the total number of almonds each type of container can hold.
2. Determine the total number of almonds that can be held initially.
3. Account for the broken tables and recalculate the total number of almonds that can be held.
4. Calculate the number of almonds remaining after Carlos eats one-fifth.
5. Determine how many more bowls are needed to hold the remaining almonds, ensuring to account for whole bowls.

### Advice:

- Always double-check calculations, especially when dealing with fractions and whole numbers.
- Be mindful of the capacity of each container and adjust calculations accordingly.
- Ensure that the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.

For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

[Example Input]
Question: Maria places apples in baskets and crates. Each basket can hold 15 apples, while each crate can hold twice that amount. Maria has 450 apples, 5 baskets, and 4 crates. Unfortunately, 1 crate breaks. Maria then eats one-fourth of all the apples. How many more baskets does Maria need so she can place all the remaining apples?

Wrong answer: Maria initially has 450 apples. Each crate can hold 30 apples (twice the amount of a basket). With 4 crates, she can hold 120 apples. With 5 baskets, she can hold 75 apples. So, she can hold 195 apples in total. After 1 crate breaks, she can hold 150 apples in crates. After eating one-fourth of the apples, she has 337.5 apples left. She needs 337.5 - 150 = 187.5 apples in baskets. Since each basket holds 15 apples, she needs 187.5 / 15 = 12.5 baskets. Since she can't have half a basket, she needs 13 more baskets.

Correct answer: Maria initially has 450 apples. Each crate can hold 30 apples (twice the amount of a basket). With 4 crates, she can hold 120 apples. With 5 baskets, she can hold 75 apples. So, she can hold 195 apples in total. After 1 crate breaks, she can hold 90 apples in crates. After eating one-fourth of the apples, she has 337.5 apples left. She needs 337.5 - 90 = 247.5 apples in baskets. Since each basket holds 15 apples, she needs 247.5 / 15 = 16.5 baskets. Since she can't have half a basket, she needs 17 more baskets.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of apples that could be held after one crate broke and did not account for the correct number of apples remaining after Maria ate some.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect subtraction
- Incorrect division
- Incorrect handling of fractions

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total number of apples each type of container can hold.
2. Determine the total number of apples that can be held after accounting for the broken crate.
3. Calculate the number of apples remaining after Maria eats one-fourth.
4. Determine how many more baskets are needed to hold the remaining apples, ensuring to account for whole baskets.

Advice:
- Always double-check calculations, especially when dealing with fractions and whole numbers.
- Be mindful of the capacity of each container and adjust calculations accordingly.
- Ensure that the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.

Solution:
Maria initially has 450 apples. Each crate can hold 30 apples (twice the amount of a basket). With 4 crates, she can hold 120 apples. With 5 baskets, she can hold 75 apples. So, she can hold 195 apples in total. After 1 crate breaks, she can hold 90 apples in crates. After eating one-fourth of the apples, she has 337.5 apples left. She needs 337.5 - 90 = 247.5 apples in baskets. Since each basket holds 15 apples, she needs 247.5 / 15 = 16.5 baskets. Since she can't have half a basket, she needs 17 more baskets.

p2,gsm-symbolic,mistralai/mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501,Mohammed goes to the store to buy some rice. The normal brand of rice he buys costs ¥15 per kg. He has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 3 kgs of rice per day. The store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs; any additional rice is sold at the regular price. Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2. How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily rice consumption for a week:**
   Mohammed uses 3 kgs of rice per day. For a week (7 days), he will need:
   \[
   3 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ kg}
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of the more expensive brand of rice:**
   The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg. The more expensive brand costs 20% more. So, the cost per kg of the more expensive brand is:
   \[
   ¥15 + (20\% \text{ of } ¥15) = ¥15 + (0.20 \times ¥15) = ¥15 + ¥3 = ¥18 \text{ per kg}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the first 10 kgs with the 40% discount:**
   The discount applies to the first 10 kgs. The discounted price per kg is:
   \[
   ¥18 - (40\% \text{ of } ¥18) = ¥18 - (0.40 \times ¥18) = ¥18 - ¥7.2 = ¥10.8 \text{ per kg}
   \]
   So, the cost for the first 10 kgs is:
   \[
   10 \text{ kg} \times ¥10.8 \text{ per kg} = ¥108
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the remaining 11 kgs at the regular price:**
   The remaining 11 kgs (21 kg total - 10 kg discounted) will be at the regular price of ¥18 per kg:
   \[
   11 \text{ kg} \times ¥18 \text{ per kg} = ¥198
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the rice:**
   The total cost for the rice is the sum of the discounted and non-discounted portions:
   \[
   ¥108 + ¥198 = ¥306
   \]

6. **Add the cost of the bagel:**
   Mohammed also buys a bagel for ¥2. So, the total cost including the bagel is:
   \[
   ¥306 + ¥2 = ¥308
   \]

Therefore, Mohammed has to pay ¥308.",308.0,1,"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice per kg.

The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand, which is ¥15 per kg.

20% of ¥15 is (20/100) * ¥15 = ¥3.

So, the more expensive brand costs ¥15 + ¥3 = ¥18 per kg.

Mohammed uses 3 kgs of rice per day, so for a week (7 days), he needs 3 kgs/day * 7 days = 21 kgs of rice.

The store has a 40% discount on rice up to 10 kgs. So, for the first 10 kgs, the discount applies.

40% of ¥18 is (40/100) * ¥18 = ¥7.2.

So, the discounted price per kg for the first 10 kgs is ¥18 - ¥7.2 = ¥10.8.

The cost for the first 10 kgs is 10 kgs * ¥10.8/kg = ¥108.

For the remaining 11 kgs (21 kgs - 10 kgs), the discount does not apply, so the cost is ¥18 per kg.

The cost for the remaining 11 kgs is 11 kgs * ¥18/kg = ¥198.

The total cost for the rice is ¥108 + ¥198 = ¥306.

However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Current Total Signatures:**
   Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   Mia has 31 signatures.
   Total signatures so far = 36 (Jasmine) + 31 (Mia) = 67 signatures.

2. **Goal:**

p2,gsm-symbolic,mistralai/mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501,"Jasmine and Mia are sisters from Nairobi who love collecting signatures from authors. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Jasmine and Mia compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Jasmine has 36 signatures in her book, and Mia has 31. The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Current Total Signatures:**
   Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   Mia has 31 signatures.
   Total signatures so far = 36 (Jasmine) + 31 (Mia) = 67 signatures.

2. **Goal:**
   They want to reach 145 signatures by the end of the break.

3. **Remaining Signatures Needed:**
   145 (goal) - 67 (current) = 78 signatures.

4. **Jasmine's Collection Rate:**
   Jasmine collects 5 fewer signatures per week for the remaining 2 weeks.
   If Jasmine was collecting at a rate of \( x \) signatures per week, her new rate is \( x - 5 \) per week.

5. **Mia's Collection Rate:**
   Let's denote Mia's new weekly collection rate as \( y \) signatures per week.

6. **Total Signatures Collected in 2 Weeks:**
   Jasmine's total for 2 weeks = \( 2 \times (x - 5) \).
   Mia's total for 2 weeks = \( 2 \times y \).

7. **Equation for Total Signatures:**
   The total signatures collected in 2 weeks by both sisters should be 78.
   \[
   2 \times (x - 5) + 2 \times y = 78
   \]

8. **Simplify the Equation:**
   \[
   2x - 10 + 2y = 78
   \]
   \[
   2x + 2y = 88
   \]
   \[
   x + y = 44
   \]

9. **Determine Jasmine's Original Rate:**
   Since Jasmine has 36 signatures after 6 weeks, her original weekly collection rate \( x \) is:
   \[
   x = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \text{ signatures per week}
   \]

10. **Solve for Mia's Weekly Collection Rate:**
    Substitute \( x = 6 \) into the equation \( x + y = 44 \):
    \[
    6 + y = 44
    \]
    \[
    y = 44 - 6
    \]
    \[
    y = 38
    \]

Therefore, Mia needs to collect 38 signatures per week to ensure they reach their goal of 145 signatures by the end of the break.",145.0,0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of signatures Jasmine and Mia will have after the remaining 2 weeks and then determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week to reach their goal of 145 signatures.

1. **Calculate the total number of signatures they currently have:**
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   - Mia has 31 signatures.
   - Total signatures so far: 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

2. **Determine the number of signatures they need to reach their goal:**
   - Goal: 145 signatures.
   - Signatures needed: 145 - 67 = 78 signatures.

3. **Calculate the number of signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks:**
   - Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 signatures per week.
   - Original weekly collection: 36 / 6 = 6 signatures per week.
   - Reduced weekly collection: 6 - 5 = 1 signature per week.
   - Total signatures for Jasmine in 2 weeks: 1 * 2 = 2 signatures.

4. **Calculate the number of signatures Mia needs to collect in the remaining 2 weeks:**
   - Total signatures needed: 78.
   - Signatures Jasmine will collect: 2.
   - Signatures Mia needs to collect: 78 - 2 = 76 signatures.

5. **Determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week:**
   - Total signatures Mia needs to collect: 76.
   - Number of weeks remaining: 2.
   - Signatures per week for Mia: 76 / 2 = 38 signatures per week.

Question: Alex and Jamie are friends who love collecting stamps. During their summer vacation, they spend every weekend collecting stamps. After 4 weeks, Alex has 28 stamps, and Jamie has 24. They have 3 more weeks of vacation, and they decide they want to reach 120 stamps between them by the end of the vacation. However, during the remaining 3 weeks, Alex is only able to collect stamps on one weekend day, reducing his weekly collection by 4 per week, while Jamie decides to increase his weekly collection. How many stamps will Jamie need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Wrong answer: Jamie needs to collect 10 stamps per week. I calculated the total number of stamps needed in the remaining weeks and divided it by 3, without considering the reduction in Alex's collection rate.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Jasmine and Mia are sisters from Nairobi who love collecting signatures from authors. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Jasmine and Mia compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Jasmine has 36 signatures in her book, and Mia has 31. The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Current Total Signatures:**
   Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   Mia has 31 signatures.
   Total signatures so far = 36 (Jasmine) + 31 (Mia) = 67 signatures.

2. **Goal:**
   They want to reach 145 signatures by the end of the break.

3. **Remaining Signatures Needed:**
   145 (goal) - 67 (current) = 78 signatures.

4. **Jasmine's Collection Rate:**
   Jasmine collects 5 fewer signatures per week for the remaining 2 weeks.
   If Jasmine was collecting at a rate of \( x \) signatures per week, her new rate is \( x - 5 \) per week.

5. **Mia's Collection Rate:**
   Let's denote Mia's new weekly collection rate as \( y \) signatures per week.

6. **Total Signatures Collected in 2 Weeks:**
   Jasmine's total for 2 weeks = \( 2 \times (x - 5) \).
   Mia's total for 2 weeks = \( 2 \times y \).

7. **Equation for Total Signatures:**
   The total signatures collected in 2 weeks by both sisters should be 78.
   \[
   2 \times (x - 5) + 2 \times y = 78
   \]

8. **Simplify the Equation:**
   \[
   2x - 10 + 2y = 78
   \]
   \[
   2x + 2y = 88
   \]
   \[
   x + y = 44
   \]

9. **Determine Jasmine's Original Rate:**
   Since Jasmine has 36 signatures after 6 weeks, her original weekly collection rate \( x \) is:
   \[
   x = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \text{ signatures per week}
   \]

10. **Solve for Mia's Weekly Collection Rate:**
    Substitute \( x = 6 \) into the equation \( x + y = 44 \):
    \[
    6 + y = 44
    \]
    \[
    y = 44 - 6
    \]
    \[
    y = 38
    \]

Therefore, Mia needs to collect 38 signatures per week to ensure they reach their goal of 145 signatures by the end of the break.",145.0,0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of signatures Jasmine and Mia will have after the remaining 2 weeks and then determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week to reach their goal of 145 signatures.

1. **Calculate the total number of signatures they currently have:**
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   - Mia has 31 signatures.
   - Total signatures so far: 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

2. **Determine the number of signatures they need to reach their goal:**
   - Goal: 145 signatures.
   - Signatures needed: 145 - 67 = 78 signatures.

3. **Calculate the number of signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks:**
   - Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 signatures per week.
   - Original weekly collection: 36 / 6 = 6 signatures per week.
   - Reduced weekly collection: 6 - 5 = 1 signature per week.
   - Total signatures for Jasmine in 2 weeks: 1 * 2 = 2 signatures.

4. **Calculate the number of signatures Mia needs to collect in the remaining 2 weeks:**
   - Total signatures needed: 78.
   - Signatures Jasmine will collect: 2.
   - Signatures Mia needs to collect: 78 - 2 = 76 signatures.

5. **Determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week:**
   - Total signatures Mia needs to collect: 76.
   - Number of weeks remaining: 2.
   - Signatures per week for Mia: 76 / 2 = 38 signatures per week.

Question: Alex and Jamie are friends who love collecting stamps. During their summer vacation, they spend every weekend collecting stamps. After 8 weeks, Alex and Jamie compare their stamp collections, counting up the number of stamps each has collected. Alex has 48 stamps in his collection, and Jamie has 40. The friends have 4 more weeks of summer vacation, and they decide they want to reach 200 stamps between them by the end of the vacation. However, during the remaining 4 weeks, Alex is only able to collect stamps on weekends, reducing his weekly collection by 3 per week, while Jamie decides to increase his weekly collection. How many stamps will Jamie need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Wrong answer: Jamie needs to collect 10 stamps per week. I calculated the total number of stamps needed in the remaining weeks and divided it by the number of weeks, without considering the change in Alex's collection rate.

---

[Example Output]

Explanation:
I miscalculated the total number of stamps needed per week by not accounting for the reduction in Alex's weekly collection. I also did not consider the initial number of stamps each person had.

Question: Sofia and Benjamin have 246 minutes to walk to the mall together starting from their home. It takes them 16 minutes to get to the corner where the cinema is. It takes them another 52 minutes to get to the gym. When they reach the gym, they remember they forgot their wallets at home, so they have to return to pick up their wallets and then walk all the way back to the gym again. Once they reach the gym for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the mall without being late?
Your initial answer was: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Sofia and Benjamin have spent walking and then subtract that from the total time they have to get to the mall.

1. Time spent walking to the corner where the cinema is: 16 minutes.
2. Time spent walking from the cinema to the gym: 52 minutes.
3. Time spent walking back home to pick up their wallets: 52 minutes (same as the time to get to the gym).
4. Time spent walking back to the gym: 52 minutes (same as the time to get to the gym).

Now, let's add up all the time spent:
Total time spent = 16 (to the cinema) + 52 (to the gym) + 52 (back home) + 52 (back to the gym) = 172 minutes.

They started with 246 minutes to get to the mall. So, the time remaining is:
Time remaining = 246 - 172 = 74 minutes.

","### Reflection

**Explanation:**
I incorrectly calculated the total time spent walking back and forth. I did not account for the time spent walking back to the cinema corner after returning home to pick up their wallets. This oversight led to an incorrect calculation of the remaining time.

**Error Keywords:**
- Calculation error
- Arithmetic error
- Omission error
- Misinterpretation of the problem

### Corrected Solution

1. **Identify the total time available:**
   Sofia and Benjamin have 246 minutes to walk to the mall.

2. **Calculate the time spent walking to the cinema corner:**
   16 minutes.

3. **Calculate the time spent walking from the cinema to the gym:**
   52 minutes.

4. **Calculate the time spent walking back home to pick up their wallets:**
   Since they have to walk back to the cinema corner first, we need to add the time spent walking to the cinema corner again:
   16 minutes (to the cinema) + 52 minutes (to the gym) = 68 minutes.

5. **Calculate the time spent walking back to the gym:**
   They have to walk back to the cinema corner and then to the gym:
   68 minutes (back to the cinema and then to the gym).

6. **Add up all the time spent:**
   Total time spent = 16 (to the cinema) + 52 (to the gym) + 68 (back home and to the gym) + 52 (back to the gym) = 188 minutes.

7. **Calculate the time remaining:**
   Time remaining = 246 - 188 = 58 minutes.

**The answer is 58 minutes.**

### Instructions for Future Problems

4. They realize they forgot their wallets and have to return home. This means they have to walk back the same distance they've already covered, which is 68 minutes.

So, the time spent walking back home is also 68 minutes.

5. After picking up their wallets, they have to walk the same distance again to get back to the gym. This is another 68 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent so far:
68 minutes (to the gym) + 68 minutes (back home) + 68 minutes (back to the gym) = 204 minutes

6. To find out how much time they have left to get to the mall, we subtract the time spent from the total time they have:
246 minutes (total time) - 204 minutes (time spent) = 42 minutes

Sofia and Benjamin have 42 minutes left to get to the mall without being late.",42.0,1,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Sofia and Benjamin have spent walking and then subtract that from the total time they have to get to the mall.

1. Time spent walking to the corner where the cinema is: 16 minutes.
2. Time spent walking from the cinema to the gym: 52 minutes.
3. Time spent walking back home to pick up their wallets: 52 minutes (same as the time to get to the gym).
4. Time spent walking back to the gym: 52 minutes (same as the time to get to the gym).

Now, let's add up all the time spent:
Total time spent = 16 (to the cinema) + 52 (to the gym) + 52 (back home) + 52 (back to the gym) = 172 minutes.

They started with 246 minutes to get to the mall. So, the time remaining is:
Time remaining = 246 - 172 = 74 minutes.

The answer is 74.",74.0,0,1.0,0.0,74.0,"--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

[Example Input]
Question: Alex and Jamie have 300 minutes to walk to the park together starting from their home. It takes them 20 minutes to get to the library. It takes them another 40 minutes to get to the museum. When they reach the museum, they remember they forgot their keys at home, so they have to return to pick up their keys and then walk all the way back to the museum again. Once they reach the museum for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the park without being late?

Wrong answer: They have 200 minutes left to get to the park. I calculated the total time spent as 20 + 40 = 60 minutes for the first trip to the museum, and then added another 60 minutes for the return trip, totaling 120 minutes. I then subtracted this from 300 minutes, which gave me 180 minutes. However, I forgot to account for the time it takes to return to the museum, which is 40 minutes, so I subtracted 40 minutes from 180 minutes, which gave me 140 minutes. I then subtracted 40 minutes for the return trip to the museum, which gave me 100 minutes. I then subtracted 40 minutes for the return trip to the museum, which gave me 60 minutes. I then subtracted 40 minutes for the return trip to the museum, which gave me 20 minutes. I then subtracted 40 minutes for the return trip to the museum, which gave me 200 minutes.

[Example Input]
Question: Alex and Jamie have 300 minutes to walk to the park together starting from their home. It takes them 20 minutes to get to the library. It takes them another 40 minutes to get to the museum. When they reach the museum, they remember they forgot their keys at home, so they have to return to pick up their keys and then walk all the way back to the museum again. Once they reach the museum for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the park without being late?

Wrong answer: They have 200 minutes left to get to the park. I calculated the total time spent as 20 + 40 = 60 minutes for the first trip to the museum, and then added another 60 minutes for the return trip, totaling 120 minutes. I then subtracted this from 300 minutes, which gave me 180 minutes. However, I forgot to account for the time it takes to return to the museum, which is 40 minutes, so I subtracted 40 minutes from 180 minutes, which gave me 140 minutes. I then subtracted 40 minutes for the return trip to the museum, which gave me 100 minutes. I then subtracted 40 minutes for the return trip to the museum, which gave me 60 minutes. I then subtracted 40 minutes for the return trip to the museum, which gave me 20 minutes. I then subtracted 40 minutes for the return trip to the museum, which gave me 200 minutes.

Once they reach the gym for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the mall without being late?",42.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sofia and Benjamin start with 246 minutes to get to the mall.
2. It takes them 16 minutes to get to the corner where the cinema is.
3. It takes them another 52 minutes to get to the gym.

So far, they have spent:
16 minutes (to the cinema) + 52 minutes (to the gym) = 68 minutes

4. They realize they forgot their wallets and have to return home. This means they have to walk back the same distance they've already covered, which is 68 minutes.

So, the time spent walking back home is also 68 minutes.

5. After picking up their wallets, they have to walk the same distance again to get back to the gym. This is another 68 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent so far:
68 minutes (to the gym) + 68 minutes (back home) + 68 minutes (back to the gym) = 204 minutes

6. To find out how much time they have left to get to the mall, we subtract the time spent from the total time they have:
246 minutes (total time) - 204 minutes (time spent) = 42 minutes

Sofia and Benjamin have 42 minutes left to get to the mall without being late.",42.0,1,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Sofia and Benjamin have spent walking and then subtract that from the total time they have to get to the mall.

1. Time spent walking to the corner where the cinema is: 16 minutes.
2. Time spent walking from the cinema to the gym: 52 minutes.
3. Time spent walking back home to pick up their wallets: 52 minutes (same as the time to get to the gym).
4. Time spent walking back to the gym: 52 minutes (same as the time to get to the gym).

Now, let's add up all the time spent:
Total time spent = 16 (to the cinema) + 52 (to the gym) + 52 (back home) + 52 (back to the gym) = 172 minutes.

They started with 246 minutes to get to the mall. So, the time remaining is:

He makes 48 total ice cubes, including 10 giant cubes, 14 small cubes, 12 medium cubes, and some tiny cubes. How many ounces of water does Leon have left?",122.0,"First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for each size of ice cube.

For giant cubes:
10 giant cubes * 12 ounces per cube = 120 ounces

For medium cubes:
12 medium cubes * 5 ounces per cube = 60 ounces

For small cubes:
14 small cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 7 ounces

Now, let's find out the size of the tiny cubes. Since tiny cubes are half the size of small cubes, they use:
0.5 ounces / 2 = 0.25 ounces per tiny cube

Now, let's calculate the number of tiny cubes made. We know the total number of ice cubes is 48, so:
Total tiny cubes = Total ice cubes - (Giant cubes + Medium cubes + Small cubes)
Total tiny cubes = 48 - (10 + 12 + 14)
Total tiny cubes = 48 - 36

Question: Leon wants to make different sized ice cubes with 312 ounces of water. He can make giant cubes that use 12 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 5 ounces, small cubes that use 1/2 of a ounce, and tiny cubes that are half the size of small cubes. He makes 48 total ice cubes, including 10 giant cubes, 14 small cubes, 12 medium cubes, and some tiny cubes. How many ounces of water does Leon have left?
Your initial answer was: First, let's calculate the amount of water used for each type of ice cube:

1. Giant cubes: 10 cubes * 12 ounces/cube = 120 ounces
2. Medium cubes: 14 cubes * 5 ounces/cube = 70 ounces
3. Small cubes: 12 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 6 ounces

Now, let's find out how many tiny cubes Leon made. We know the total number of cubes is 48, so:

Total cubes = Giant cubes + Medium cubes + Small cubes + Tiny cubes
48 = 10 + 14 + 12 + Tiny cubes
Tiny cubes = 48 - 10 - 14 - 12
Tiny cubes = 22

Since tiny cubes are half the size of small cubes, each tiny cube uses 0.25 ounces of water. So, the total water used for tiny cubes is:

Tiny cubes water = 22 cubes * 0.25 ounces/cube = 5.5 ounces

Now, let's add up all the water used:

Total water used = Water for giant cubes + Water for medium cubes + Water for small cubes + Water for tiny cubes
Total water used = 120 + 70 + 6 + 5.5
Total water used = 201.5 ounces

Finally, let's find out how much water Leon has left:

Water left = Initial water - Total water used
Water left = 312 ounces - 201.5 ounces
Water left = 110.5 ounces

The answer is 110.5 ounces.

2. Now, let's find out the total number of students who have hobbies other than playing video games. We add up the number of students who like to hike, play chess, swim, play football, and bake:
   69 (hike) + 8 (chess) + 13 (swim) + 13 (football) + 49 (bake) = 152 students

3. To find out how many students like to play video games, we subtract the number of students with other hobbies from the total number of students:
   160 (total students) - 152 (students with other hobbies) = 8 students

4. Finally, to find the percentage of students who like to play video games, we divide the number of students who like to play video games by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
   (8 / 160) * 100 = 5%

After 2 days, DeShawn decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half. How many days will it take for the cake to be fully eaten?",4.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

First, let's determine how many pieces each person can eat per day:

- Arash can eat 5 pieces a day.
- Ava can eat twice as much as Arash, so Ava can eat 5 * 2 = 10 pieces a day.
- DeShawn can eat twice as much as Ava, so DeShawn can eat 10 * 2 = 20 pieces a day.

For the first 2 days, they all eat at their initial rates. So, the total consumption for the first 2 days is:

- Arash: 5 pieces/day * 2 days = 10 pieces
- Ava: 10 pieces/day * 2 days = 20 pieces
- DeShawn: 20 pieces/day * 2 days = 40 pieces

Total consumption in the first 2 days = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 pieces

After 2 days, the cake has 120 - 70 = 50 pieces left.

The new daily consumption rate for all three is:

- Arash: 5 pieces/day
- Ava: 10 pieces/day
- DeShawn: 10 pieces/day

Total daily consumption after the first 2 days = 5 + 10 + 10 = 25 pieces/day

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to eat the remaining 50 pieces at the rate of 25 pieces per day:

50 pieces / 25 pieces/day = 2 days

Now, let's add all these numbers together to find the total number of items before the bouncy balls:

Total items = Building blocks + Stuffed animals + Action figures + Crayons + Stickers + Stacking rings
Total items = 43 + 5 + 96 + 12 + 72 + 29
Total items = 257

Gabrielle's total number of items after buying the bouncy balls is 320. To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we subtract the total number of items before the bouncy balls from the total number of items after:

Bouncy balls = Total items after - Total items before
Bouncy balls = 320 - 257
Bouncy balls = 63

So, the tube of bouncy balls contained 63 bouncy balls.",63.0,1,"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to calculate the total number of other items Gabrielle has and then subtract that from the total number of items.

1. **Building Blocks**: 43
2. **Stuffed Animals**: 5
3. **Action Figures**: Twice the number of blocks and stuffed animals combined.
   - Number of blocks and stuffed animals combined: 43 + 5 = 48
   - Number of action figures: 2 * 48 = 96
4. **Crayons**: 12
5. **Stickers**: 6 pages with 12 stickers each.
   - Total stickers: 6 * 12 = 72
6. **Stacking Rings**: 29

Now, let's add up all these items:
- Total items (excluding bouncy balls): 43 (blocks) + 5 (stuffed animals) + 96 (action figures) + 12 (crayons) + 72 (stickers) + 29 (stacking rings)
- Total items (excluding bouncy balls): 43 + 5 + 96 + 12 + 72 + 29 = 257

Gabrielle has a total of 320 items, including the bouncy balls. To find out how many bouncy balls there are:
- Number of bouncy balls: 320 (total items) - 257 (other items) = 63

Question: Faisal is selling muffins and apricot pies for a fundraiser. On Wednesday, he sold 27 boxes of muffin and 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie, than on Thursday. On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday and 21 boxes of apricot pie. On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?
Your initial answer was: To find Faisal's average daily earning, we need to calculate the total earnings for each day and then find the average.

**Wednesday:**
- Muffins sold: 27 boxes
- Apricot pies sold: 27 - 13 = 14 boxes

**Thursday:**
- Muffins sold: 27 + 11 = 38 boxes
- Apricot pies sold: 21 boxes

**Friday:**
- Total boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday: (27 + 14) + (38 + 21) = 41 + 59 = 100 boxes
- Since Friday's sales are the same as the past two days combined, 100 boxes were sold on Friday.

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each day:

**Wednesday's earnings:**
- Muffins: 27 boxes * ₺9 = ₺243
- Apricot pies: 14 boxes * ₺21 = ₺294
- Total for Wednesday: ₺243 + ₺294 = ₺537

**Thursday's earnings:**
- Muffins: 38 boxes * ₺9 = ₺342
- Apricot pies: 21 boxes * ₺21 = ₺441
- Total for Thursday: ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783

**Friday's earnings:**
- Since we don't know the distribution between muffins and apricot pies, we'll assume the same ratio as the total from Wednesday and Thursday.
- Total boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday: 100 boxes
- Total earnings on Wednesday and Thursday: ₺537 + ₺783 = ₺1320
- Average price per box: ₺1320 / 100 boxes = ₺13.20 per box
- Total for Friday: 100 boxes * ₺13.20 = ₺1320

**Total earnings for the three days:**
- Total: ₺537 (Wednesday) + ₺783 (Thursday) + ₺1320 (Friday) = ₺2640

2. **Thursday's Sales:**
   - Muffins sold: 27 + 11 = 38 boxes
   - Apricot pies sold: 21 boxes

3. **Friday's Sales:**
   - Total boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday: (27 + 14) + (38 + 21) = 41 + 59 = 100 boxes
   - Since Friday's sales are the same as the past two days combined, 100 boxes were sold on Friday.

4. **Earnings Calculation:**
   - **Wednesday's earnings:**
     - Muffins: 27 boxes * ₺9 = ₺243
     - Apricot pies: 14 boxes * ₺21 = ₺294
     - Total for Wednesday: ₺243 + ₺294 = ₺537

   - **Thursday's earnings:**
     - Muffins: 38 boxes * ₺9 = ₺342
     - Apricot pies: 21 boxes * ₺21 = ₺441
     - Total for Thursday: ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783

   - **Friday's earnings:**
     - Since we don't know the distribution between muffins and apricot pies, we need to calculate the total earnings based on the given prices and the total number of boxes sold.
     - Total earnings on Wednesday and Thursday: ₺537 + ₺783 = ₺1320
     - Total boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday: 100 boxes
     - Average price per box: ₺1320 / 100 boxes = ₺13.20 per box
     - Total for Friday: 100 boxes * ₺13.20 = ₺1320

5. **Total Earnings for the Three Days:**
   - Total: ₺537 (Wednesday) + ₺783 (Thursday) + ₺1320 (Friday) = ₺2640

6. **Average Daily Earning:**
   - Average: ₺2640 / 3 days = ₺880

The answer is ₺880.

### Instructions for Future Problems

1. **Identify the sales data for each day.**
2. **Calculate the total earnings for each day based on the given prices.**
3. **Sum the total earnings for all days.**
4. **Divide the total earnings by the number of days to find the average daily earning.**

If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?",796.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

**Wednesday's Sales:**
- Muffins: 27 boxes
- Apricot Pies: 27 - 13 = 14 boxes

**Thursday's Sales:**
- Muffins: 27 + 11 = 38 boxes
- Apricot Pies: 21 boxes

**Friday's Sales:**
- Total boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday: (27 + 14) + (38 + 21) = 41 + 59 = 100 boxes
- Since Friday's sales are the same as the combined sales of Wednesday and Thursday, Faisal sold 100 boxes on Friday.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day.

**Wednesday's Earnings:**
- Muffins: 27 boxes * ₺9/box = ₺243
- Apricot Pies: 14 boxes * ₺21/box = ₺294
- Total for Wednesday: ₺243 + ₺294 = ₺537

**Thursday's Earnings:**
- Muffins: 38 boxes * ₺9/box = ₺342
- Apricot Pies: 21 boxes * ₺21/box = ₺441
- Total for Thursday: ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783

**Friday's Earnings:**
- Since we don't know the distribution of muffins and apricot pies on Friday, we can't calculate the exact earnings. However, we can calculate the average daily earning based on the total earnings from Wednesday and Thursday.

**Total Earnings for Wednesday and Thursday:**
- Total: ₺537 + ₺783 = ₺1320

**Average Daily Earning:**
- Since we have data for two days, we can calculate the average daily earning by dividing the total earnings by 2.
- Average Daily Earning: ₺1320 / 2 = ₺660

Therefore, Faisal's average daily earning based on the given data is ₺660.",660.0,0,"To find Faisal's average daily earning, we need to calculate the total earnings for each day and then find the average.

**Wednesday:**
- Muffins sold: 27 boxes
- Apricot pies sold: 27 - 13 = 14 boxes

**Thursday:**
- Muffins sold: 27 + 11 = 38 boxes
- Apricot pies sold: 21 boxes

**Friday:**
- Total boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday: (27 + 14) + (38 + 21) = 41 + 59 = 100 boxes
- Since Friday's sales are the same as the past two days combined, 100 boxes were sold on Friday.

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each day:

**Wednesday's earnings:**
- Muffins: 27 boxes * ₺9 = ₺243
- Apricot pies: 14 boxes * ₺21 = ₺294
- Total for Wednesday: ₺243 + ₺294 = ₺537

**Thursday's earnings:**
- Muffins: 38 boxes * ₺9 = ₺342
- Apricot pies: 21 boxes * ₺21 = ₺441
- Total for Thursday: ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783

**Friday's earnings:**
- Since we don't know the distribution between muffins and apricot pies, we'll assume the same ratio as the total from Wednesday and Thursday.
- Total boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday: 100 boxes
- Total earnings on Wednesday and Thursday: ₺537 + ₺783 = ₺1320
- Average price per box: ₺1320 / 100 boxes = ₺13.20 per box
- Total for Friday: 100 boxes * ₺13.20 = ₺1320

**Total earnings for the three days:**
- Total: ₺537 (Wednesday) + ₺783 (Thursday) + ₺1320 (Friday) = ₺2640

**Average daily earning:**
- Average: ₺2640 / 3 days = ₺880

Question: A bakery sells two types of pastries: croissants and danishes. On Monday, the bakery sold 15 croissants and 8 fewer danishes than on Tuesday. On Tuesday, the bakery sold 7 more croissants than on Monday and 18 danishes. On Wednesday, the bakery sold as many pastries as it did in the past two days combined. If the croissant cost $2 and the danish cost $3, what was the bakery's average daily earning?

Wrong answer: I calculated the total number of pastries sold on Monday and Tuesday and then multiplied by the price of each pastry. I did not account for the different prices of croissants and danishes correctly, leading to an incorrect total earning. I then divided this incorrect total by 3 to find the average daily earning, which was also incorrect.

If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?",796.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

**Wednesday's Sales:**
- Muffins: 27 boxes
- Apricot Pies: 27 - 13 = 14 boxes

**Thursday's Sales:**
- Muffins: 27 + 11 = 38 boxes
- Apricot Pies: 21 boxes

**Friday's Sales:**
- Total boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday: (27 + 14) + (38 + 21) = 41 + 59 = 100 boxes
- Since Friday's sales are the same as the combined sales of Wednesday and Thursday, Faisal sold 100 boxes on Friday.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day.

**Wednesday's Earnings:**
- Muffins: 27 boxes * ₺9/box = ₺243
- Apricot Pies: 14 boxes * ₺21/box = ₺294
- Total for Wednesday: ₺243 + ₺294 = ₺537

**Thursday's Earnings:**
- Muffins: 38 boxes * ₺9/box = ₺342
- Apricot Pies: 21 boxes * ₺21/box = ₺441
- Total for Thursday: ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783

**Friday's Earnings:**
- Since we don't know the distribution of muffins and apricot pies on Friday, we can't calculate the exact earnings. However, we can calculate the average daily earning based on the total earnings from Wednesday and Thursday.

**Total Earnings for Wednesday and Thursday:**
- Total: ₺537 + ₺783 = ₺1320

**Average Daily Earning:**
- Since we have data for two days, we can calculate the average daily earning by dividing the total earnings by 2.
- Average Daily Earning: ₺1320 / 2 = ₺660

Therefore, Faisal's average daily earning based on the given data is ₺660.",660.0,0,"To find Faisal's average daily earning, we need to calculate the total earnings for each day and then find the average.

**Wednesday:**
- Muffins sold: 27 boxes
- Apricot pies sold: 27 - 13 = 14 boxes

**Thursday:**
- Muffins sold: 27 + 11 = 38 boxes
- Apricot pies sold: 21 boxes

**Friday:**
- Total boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday: (27 + 14) + (38 + 21) = 41 + 59 = 100 boxes
- Since Friday's sales are the same as the past two days combined, 100 boxes were sold on Friday.

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each day:

**Wednesday's earnings:**
- Muffins: 27 boxes * ₺9 = ₺243
- Apricot pies: 14 boxes * ₺21 = ₺294
- Total for Wednesday: ₺243 + ₺294 = ₺537

**Thursday's earnings:**
- Muffins: 38 boxes * ₺9 = ₺342
- Apricot pies: 21 boxes * ₺21 = ₺441
- Total for Thursday: ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783

**Friday's earnings:**
- Since we don't know the distribution between muffins and apricot pies, we'll assume the same ratio as the total from Wednesday and Thursday.
- Total boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday: 100 boxes
- Total earnings on Wednesday and Thursday: ₺537 + ₺783 = ₺1320
- Average price per box: ₺1320 / 100 boxes = ₺13.20 per box
- Total for Friday: 100 boxes * ₺13.20 = ₺1320

**Total earnings for the three days:**
- Total: ₺537 (Wednesday) + ₺783 (Thursday) + ₺1320 (Friday) = ₺2640

**Average daily earning:**
- Average: ₺2640 / 3 days = ₺880

Question: In Mrs. Garcia's class of 120 students, 50% of the class are swimmers. Out of the remaining class, 45% of the students are choir members or part of dancers. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away tournament. Half of the swimmers are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the tournament?
Your initial answer was: First, let's find out how many students are swimmers:
- 50% of 120 students are swimmers.
- So, the number of swimmers is 0.50 * 120 = 60 students.

Next, let's find out how many students are left after removing the swimmers:
- 120 total students - 60 swimmers = 60 students remaining.

Now, let's find out how many of these remaining students are choir members or dancers:
- 45% of the remaining 60 students are choir members or dancers.
- So, the number of choir members or dancers is 0.45 * 60 = 27 students.

Now, let's find out how many swimmers are absent:
- Half of the 60 swimmers are absent.
- So, the number of absent swimmers is 0.5 * 60 = 30 students.

Now, let's find out how many swimmers are present and leaving early:
- 60 total swimmers - 30 absent swimmers = 30 swimmers present.

Now, let's add up all the students leaving early (swimmers present, choir members or dancers, and cheerleaders):
- 30 swimmers present + 27 choir members or dancers = 57 students.
- There are 3 cheerleaders for each group (swimmers, choir members or dancers), so 3 cheerleaders * 2 groups = 6 cheerleaders.
- So, the total number of students leaving early is 57 + 6 = 63 students.

The answer is 63.

Half of the swimmers are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the tournament?",66.0,"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of swimmers in the class:**
   - 50% of the class are swimmers.
   - Number of swimmers = 50% of 120 = 0.50 * 120 = 60 students.

2. **Calculate the number of students who are not swimmers:**
   - Total students - Number of swimmers = 120 - 60 = 60 students.

3. **Calculate the number of choir members or dancers:**
   - 45% of the remaining students are choir members or dancers.
   - Number of choir members or dancers = 45% of 60 = 0.45 * 60 = 27 students.

4. **Calculate the number of swimmers who are absent:**
   - Half of the swimmers are absent.
   - Number of absent swimmers = 1/2 * 60 = 30 students.

5. **Calculate the number of swimmers who are present:**
   - Number of present swimmers = Total swimmers - Absent swimmers = 60 - 30 = 30 students.

6. **Calculate the total number of students leaving early (swimmers, choir members, and dancers):**
   - Total students leaving early = Present swimmers + Choir members or dancers = 30 + 27 = 57 students.

7. **Calculate the number of cheerleaders accompanying the groups:**
   - 3 cheerleaders will accompany each group (swimmers, choir members, and dancers).
   - Total cheerleaders = 3 * 3 (since there are 3 groups) = 9 cheerleaders.

8. **Calculate the total number of students leaving early including cheerleaders:**
   - Total students leaving early = Students leaving early + Cheerleaders = 57 + 9 = 66 students.

Therefore, 66 students are leaving early to the tournament.",66.0,1,"First, let's find out how many students are swimmers:
- 50% of 120 students are swimmers.
- So, the number of swimmers is 0.50 * 120 = 60 students.

Next, let's find out how many students are left after removing the swimmers:
- 120 total students - 60 swimmers = 60 students remaining.

Now, let's find out how many of these remaining students are choir members or dancers:
- 45% of the remaining 60 students are choir members or dancers.
- So, the number of choir members or dancers is 0.45 * 60 = 27 students.

Now, let's find out how many swimmers are absent:
- Half of the 60 swimmers are absent.
- So, the number of absent swimmers is 0.5 * 60 = 30 students.

Now, let's find out how many swimmers are present and leaving early:
- 60 total swimmers - 30 absent swimmers = 30 swimmers present.

Now, let's add up all the students leaving early (swimmers present, choir members or dancers, and cheerleaders):
- 30 swimmers present + 27 choir members or dancers = 57 students.
- There are 3 cheerleaders for each group (swimmers, choir members or dancers), so 3 cheerleaders * 2 groups = 6 cheerleaders.
- So, the total number of students leaving early is 57 + 6 = 63 students.

However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",31.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many plants Olga needs to fill her flower bed and then calculate the cost based on the given discounts.

### Step 1: Determine the number of plants needed

Olga's flower bed is 132 meters long. Each plant, including the space between them, occupies 3 meters (plant width) + 12 meters (space) = 15 meters.

To find out how many plants Olga needs, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant occupies:

\[ \text{Number of plants} = \frac{132 \text{ meters}}{15 \text{ meters per plant}} = 8.8 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of plants to buy

Olga already owns 7 plants. So, she needs to buy:

\[ 9 \text{ (total needed)} - 7 \text{ (already owned)} = 2 \text{ plants} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost

Each plant costs ₣9. Since Olga is buying 2 plants, she does not qualify for the ₣5 discount. Therefore, the cost is:

Since Olga can't plant a fraction of a plant, she needs to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, she needs 9 plants.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of plants to buy

Olga already owns 7 plants. So, she needs to buy:

\[ 9 \text{ (total needed)} - 7 \text{ (already owned)} = 2 \text{ plants} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost

Each plant costs ₣9. Since Olga is buying 2 plants, she does not qualify for the ₣5 discount. Therefore, the cost is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants} \times ₣9 \text{ per plant} = ₣18 \]

### Conclusion

Olga will spend ₣18 at the store to fill up her flower bed.",18.0,0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many plants Olga needs to fill her flower bed and then calculate the cost, considering the discount.

1. **Determine the space required for each plant:**
   Each plant requires 3 meters for the plant itself and 12 meters of space between plants, totaling 15 meters per plant.

2. **Calculate the number of plants needed:**
   The flower bed is 132 meters long.
   Number of plants = Total length of flower bed / Space required per plant
   Number of plants = 132 meters / 15 meters per plant = 8.8

   Since Olga can't plant a fraction of a plant, she needs to round up to the nearest whole number. So, she needs 9 plants.

3. **Calculate the cost of the plants:**
   Olga already owns 7 plants, so she needs to buy 9 - 7 = 2 more plants.

4. **Determine the discount:**
   Since Olga is buying more than 2 plants, she receives a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase.

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   Cost per plant = ₣9
   Total cost without discount = 2 plants * ₣9 per plant = ₣18
   Total cost with discount = ₣18 - ₣5 = ₣13

[Example Input]
Question: Maria has a garden that is 150 meters long. Maria wants to plant trees along the garden. Each tree requires 4 meters of space (including the tree's width). Maria already owns 5 trees. Each tree costs ₣12 at the nursery. However, if she buys more than 3 trees, she'll receive a ₣3 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Maria spend at the nursery to fill up her garden?
Wrong answer: Maria needs to plant 37 trees (150/4 = 37.5, rounded down to 37). She already has 5, so she needs to buy 32 more. The cost without discount is 32 * ₣12 = ₣384. Since she is buying more than 3, she gets a ₣3 discount, so the total cost is ₣381.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I incorrectly rounded down the number of trees needed instead of rounding up to ensure the entire garden is covered. Additionally, I miscalculated the discount application.

Error Keywords:
- Rounding errors
- Misapplication of discounts
- Incorrect arithmetic operations

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total number of trees needed by dividing the garden length by the space required per tree.
2. Round up the result to ensure the entire garden is covered.
3. Subtract the number of trees Maria already owns from the total number needed.
4. Calculate the cost of the additional trees without the discount.
5. Apply the discount if the number of trees to be bought is more than 3.
6. Calculate the final cost.

Advice:
- Always round up when determining the number of items needed to cover a space.
- Double-check the application of discounts and ensure the conditions for the discount are met.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps and solve each step carefully.

Solution:
Maria needs to plant 38 trees (150/4 = 37.5, rounded up to 38). She already has 5, so she needs to buy 33 more. The cost without discount is 33 * ₣12 = ₣396. Since she is buying more than 3, she gets a ₣3 discount, so the total cost is ₣393.

### Step 1: Determine the number of plants needed

Olga's flower bed is 132 meters long. Each plant, including the space between them, occupies 3 meters (plant width) + 12 meters (space) = 15 meters.

4. Calculate the cost of the additional trees needed.
5. Apply the discount if the number of trees to be bought is more than 3.
6. Calculate the total cost.

Advice:
- Always double-check the spacing and width requirements.
- Ensure the discount is applied correctly based on the number of trees purchased.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid arithmetic errors.

Solution:
1. Each tree requires 4 meters for the tree itself and 14 meters for the space between trees, totaling 18 meters per tree.
2. The garden is 150 meters long, so the number of trees needed is 150 meters / 18 meters/tree = 8.33. Since we can't have a fraction of a tree, we round up to 9 trees.
3. Maria already has 5 trees, so she needs to buy 9 - 5 = 4 more trees.
4. The cost of 4 trees is 4 trees * ₣12/tree = ₣48.
5. Since Maria is buying more than 3 trees, she gets a ₣7 discount.
6. The total cost is ₣48 - ₣7 = ₣41.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Reflection

**Explanation:**
I incorrectly calculated the number of plants needed to fill the flower bed by not correctly accounting for the spacing and the width of each plant. Additionally, I misapplied the discount.

**Error Keywords:**
- Arithmetic error
- Misinterpretation of spacing requirements
- Incorrect discount application

### Solution:

1. **Determine the total space required for each plant, including the space between them:**
   - Each plant requires 3 meters for the plant itself and 12 meters for the space between plants, totaling 15 meters per plant.

2. **Calculate the number of plants needed by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:**
   - The flower bed is 132 meters long.
   - Number of plants needed = 132 meters / 15 meters/plant = 8.8.
   - Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round up to 9 plants.

3. **Subtract the number of plants Olga already owns from the total number of plants needed:**
   - Olga already has 7 plants.
   - Number of plants to buy = 9 - 7 = 2 plants.

4. **Calculate the cost of the additional plants needed:**
   - The cost of 2 plants is 2 plants * ₣9/plant = ₣18.

5. **Apply the discount if the number of plants to be bought is more than 2:**
   - Since Olga is buying 2 plants, she does not receive a discount.

6. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The total cost is ₣18.

For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

[Example Input]
Question: Maria has a garden that is 150 meters long. Maria wants to fill her garden with trees. Maria's trees grow 4 meters wide so she needs to leave 14 meters between every tree (including the trees width). Maria already owns 5 trees. Each tree costs ₣12 at the store. However, if she buys more than 3 trees, she'll receive a ₣7 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Maria spend at the store to fill up her garden?
Wrong answer: Maria needs to plant 11 trees to fill the garden. She already has 5, so she needs to buy 6 more. The cost without discount is 6 trees * ₣12/tree = ₣72. Since she is buying more than 3 trees, she gets a ₣7 discount. So, the total cost is ₣72 - ₣7 = ₣65. However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not account for the correct spacing and number of trees needed.

   The total number of pineapples picked from Saturday to Monday is 177 + 183 + 354 = 714 pineapples.

5. **Tuesday:**
   Andre picks half the amount of what he picked in the past 3 days combined.
   So, on Tuesday, he picks 714 / 2 = 357 pineapples.

6. **Total from Saturday to Tuesday:**
   The total number of pineapples picked from Saturday to Tuesday is 714 + 357 = 1071 pineapples.

7. **Number of boxes:**
   Andre is going to sell pineapples in boxes of 21 pineapples each.
   So, the number of boxes he can sell is 1071 / 21 = 51 boxes.

8. **Revenue:**
   He is going to sell each box for $8.
   So, the total revenue is 51 * $8 = $408.

How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?",1755.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

**First Month:**

1. Calculate the daily pizza consumption for the uncle and his spouse:
   - Uncle: 10 pizzas/day
   - Spouse: 20 pizzas/day
   - Combined: 10 + 20 = 30 pizzas/day

2. Calculate the daily pizza consumption for the grandchild:
   - Grandchild: 2/4 (two-fourths) of the combined number of pizzas = 2/4 * 30 = 15 pizzas/day

3. Calculate the total daily pizza consumption for the family:
   - Total: 30 (uncle and spouse) + 15 (grandchild) = 45 pizzas/day

4. Calculate the total pizza consumption for the first month (30 days):
   - Total for the first month: 45 pizzas/day * 30 days = 1350 pizzas

**Second Month (Diet):**

1. Calculate the reduced consumption for the first half of the month (15 days) with a 60% reduction:
   - Reduction: 60% of 45 pizzas/day = 0.60 * 45 = 27 pizzas/day
   - Reduced consumption: 45 - 27 = 18 pizzas/day

2. Calculate the total pizza consumption for the first half of the second month:
   - Total for the first half: 18 pizzas/day * 15 days = 270 pizzas

3. Calculate the further reduced consumption for the second half of the month (15 days) with an additional 50% reduction:
   - Further reduction: 50% of 18 pizzas/day = 0.50 * 18 = 9 pizzas/day
   - Further reduced consumption: 18 - 9 = 9 pizzas/day

4. Calculate the total pizza consumption for the second half of the second month:
   - Total for the second half: 9 pizzas/day * 15 days = 135 pizzas

3. The grandchild eats two-fourths of the combined number of pizzas eaten by the uncle and spouse per day.

First, calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by the uncle and spouse per day:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \text{ pizzas per day} \]

Next, calculate the number of pizzas the grandchild eats per day:
\[ \frac{2}{4} \times 30 = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ pizzas per day} \]

Now, calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by the family per day:
\[ 30 + 15 = 45 \text{ pizzas per day} \]

Since there are 30 days in a month, the total number of pizzas eaten in the first month is:
\[ 45 \times 30 = 1350 \text{ pizzas} \]

1. For the first half of the month (15 days), they reduce their food consumption by 60%.
2. For the second half of the month (15 days), they reduce their food consumption by an additional 50%.

First, calculate the reduction for the first half of the month:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 45 = 0.60 \times 45 = 27 \text{ pizzas per day} \]

On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?",85.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Calculate Ananya's original speed on the beach and sidewalk:**

   Let \( v_b \) be Ananya's original speed on the beach in miles per hour.
   Let \( v_s \) be Ananya's original speed on the sidewalk in miles per hour.

   Given that \( v_s = 2v_b \).

2. **Calculate the time spent on the beach and sidewalk before the injury:**

   Ananya walks 10 miles on the beach. If it takes her 50 minutes, we convert 50 minutes to hours:
   \[
   50 \text{ minutes} = \frac{50}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{5}{6} \text{ hours}
   \]

   Therefore, her original speed on the beach \( v_b \) is:
   \[
   v_b = \frac{10 \text{ miles}}{\frac{5}{6} \text{ hours}} = 10 \times \frac{6}{5} = 12 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

   Since \( v_s = 2v_b \), her original speed on the sidewalk is:
   \[
   v_s = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk before the injury:**

   Ananya walks 14 miles on the sidewalk. The time \( t_s \) spent on the sidewalk is:
   \[
   t_s = \frac{14 \text{ miles}}{24 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{14}{24} \text{ hours} = \frac{7}{12} \text{ hours}
   \]

   Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   \frac{7}{12} \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 35 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total time spent walking before the injury:**

   Total time before the injury is:
   \[
   50 \text{ minutes (beach)} + 35 \text{ minutes (sidewalk)} = 85 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Calculate Ananya's new speeds after the injury:**

   After the injury, her speed on the beach is halved:
   \[
   v_b' = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

   Her speed on the sidewalk is also halved:
   \[
   v_s' = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the new time spent on the beach and sidewalk after the injury:**

   Time spent on the beach \( t_b' \):
   \[
   t_b' = \frac{10 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{10}{6} \text{ hours} = \frac{5}{3} \text{ hours}
   \]

   Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   \frac{5}{3} \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 100 \text{ minutes}
   \]

   Time spent on the sidewalk \( t_s' \):
   \[
   t_s' = \frac{14 \text{ miles}}{12 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{14}{12} \text{ hours} = \frac{7}{6} \text{ hours}

   Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   \frac{7}{6} \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 70 \text{ minutes}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time spent walking after the injury:**

   Total time after the injury is:
   \[
   100 \text{ minutes (beach)} + 70 \text{ minutes (sidewalk)} = 170 \text{ minutes}

p2,gsm-symbolic,mistralai/mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501,"Ananya walks 24 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 miles of walking on the beach and 14 miles of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?",85.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Calculate Ananya's original speed on the beach and sidewalk:**

   Let \( v_b \) be Ananya's original speed on the beach in miles per hour.
   Let \( v_s \) be Ananya's original speed on the sidewalk in miles per hour.

   Given that \( v_s = 2v_b \).

2. **Calculate the time spent on the beach and sidewalk before the injury:**

   Ananya walks 10 miles on the beach. If it takes her 50 minutes, we convert 50 minutes to hours:
   \[
   50 \text{ minutes} = \frac{50}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{5}{6} \text{ hours}
   \]

   Therefore, her original speed on the beach \( v_b \) is:
   \[
   v_b = \frac{10 \text{ miles}}{\frac{5}{6} \text{ hours}} = 10 \times \frac{6}{5} = 12 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

   Since \( v_s = 2v_b \), her original speed on the sidewalk is:
   \[
   v_s = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk before the injury:**

   Ananya walks 14 miles on the sidewalk. The time \( t_s \) spent on the sidewalk is:
   \[
   t_s = \frac{14 \text{ miles}}{24 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{14}{24} \text{ hours} = \frac{7}{12} \text{ hours}
   \]

   Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   \frac{7}{12} \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 35 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total time spent walking before the injury:**

   Total time before the injury is:
   \[
   50 \text{ minutes (beach)} + 35 \text{ minutes (sidewalk)} = 85 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Calculate Ananya's new speeds after the injury:**

   After the injury, her speed on the beach is halved:
   \[
   v_b' = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

   Her speed on the sidewalk is also halved:
   \[
   v_s' = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the new time spent on the beach and sidewalk after the injury:**

   Time spent on the beach \( t_b' \):
   \[
   t_b' = \frac{10 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{10}{6} \text{ hours} = \frac{5}{3} \text{ hours}
   \]

   Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   \frac{5}{3} \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 100 \text{ minutes}
   \]

   Time spent on the sidewalk \( t_s' \):
   \[
   t_s' = \frac{14 \text{ miles}}{12 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{14}{12} \text{ hours} = \frac{7}{6} \text{ hours}
   \]

   Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   \frac{7}{6} \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 70 \text{ minutes}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time spent walking after the injury:**

   Total time after the injury is:
   \[
   100 \text{ minutes (beach)} + 70 \text{ minutes (sidewalk)} = 170 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, it takes Ananya 170 minutes to complete the entire 24-mile walk after her injury.",24.0,0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine Ananya's walking speeds and the time she spends on each part of her walk.

1. **Determine the original speeds:**
   - Let \( v_b \) be Ananya's original speed on the beach.
   - Let \( v_s \) be Ananya's original speed on the sidewalk.
   - Given that \( v_s = 2v_b \).

2. **Determine the new speeds after the injury:**
   - Ananya's speed on the beach is now \( \frac{v_b}{2} \).
   - Ananya's speed on the sidewalk is now \( \frac{v_s}{2} = \frac{2v_b}{2} = v_b \).

3. **Calculate the time spent on the beach:**
   - Ananya walks 10 miles on the beach.
   - The time spent on the beach is 50 minutes.

4. **Calculate the new speed on the beach:**
   - Since 50 minutes is spent on the beach, we can find the new speed on the beach.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - \( 10 \text{ miles} = \left(\frac{v_b}{2}\right) \times 50 \text{ minutes} \)
   - \( 10 = \frac{v_b}{2} \times 50 \)
   - \( 10 = 25v_b \)
   - \( v_b = \frac{10}{25} = 0.4 \text{ miles per minute} \)

5. **Calculate the new speed on the sidewalk:**
   - The new speed on the sidewalk is \( v_b = 0.4 \text{ miles per minute} \).

6. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Ananya walks 14 miles on the sidewalk.
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - \( \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{14 \text{ miles}}{0.4 \text{ miles per minute}} = 35 \text{ minutes} \)

7. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
   - Total time = 50 minutes + 35 minutes = 85 minutes

   Total earnings from collections = 2260 collections * ₣0.5 per collection = ₣1130.

6. **Calculate the additional earnings from tips:**
   Oscar earns an additional 10% in tips.
   Tips = 10% of ₣1130 = 0.10 * ₣1130 = ₣113.

7. **Calculate the total earnings for the week:**
   Total earnings = Earnings from collections + Tips = ₣1130 + ₣113 = ₣1243.

Therefore, Oscar makes ₣1243 in a week.",1243.0,1,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:**
   - Each of the first two complexes has 100 apartments.
   - So, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is 100 + 100 = 200 apartments.

2. **Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex:**
   - The third complex is 35% bigger than the first two combined.
   - The increase in the number of apartments is 35% of 200, which is 0.35 * 200 = 70 apartments.
   - So, the third complex has 200 + 70 = 270 apartments.

3. **Calculate the total number of apartments across all three complexes:**
   - The total number of apartments is 200 (first two complexes) + 270 (third complex) = 470 apartments.

4. **Calculate the number of apartments that require collection service:**
   - 9 apartments from each of the first two complexes were vacant.
   - So, the total number of vacant apartments is 9 * 2 = 18 apartments.
   - Therefore, the number of apartments that require collection service is 470 - 18 = 452 apartments.

5. **Calculate the total number of collections per week:**
   - Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each apartment.
   - So, the total number of collections per week is 452 * 5 = 2260 collections.

6. **Calculate the total earnings from collections:**
   - Oscar gets paid ₣0.5 per collection.
   - So, the total earnings from collections are 2260 * 0.5 = ₣1130.

7. **Calculate the additional earnings from tips:**
   - Oscar earns an additional 10% in tips.
   - The additional earnings from tips are 10% of ₣1130, which is 0.10 * 1130 = ₣113.

8. **Calculate the total earnings for the week:**
   - The total earnings for the week are the sum of earnings from collections and tips.
   - So, the total earnings are ₣1130 + ₣113 = ₣1243.

The answer is ₣1243.",1243.0,1,0.0,1.0,1243.0,,,,,,,,,

p2,gsm-symbolic,mistralai/mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501,"Noah is popping popcorn for a snack. As the skillet of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 70 pop in the first 10 seconds of cooking, then 2 times that amount in the next 10 seconds. The kernels increase to 4 times the initial popping rate in the next 10 seconds. In the final 10 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 10 seconds. After Noah takes the skillet off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. Noah gives one-fifth of the made popcorn to his brother Luca. How many more pieces of popcorn does Noah have to eat than his brother?",399.0,"Let's solve this step by step:

1. In the first 10 seconds, 70 kernels pop.
2. In the next 10 seconds, the number of kernels popping is 2 times the initial amount, so 2 * 70 = 140 kernels pop.
3. In the following 10 seconds, the popping rate is 4 times the initial rate, so 4 * 70 = 280 kernels pop.
4. In the final 10 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the previous 10 seconds, so 280 / 2 = 140 kernels pop.
5. After taking the skillet off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds also pop, so 140 / 4 = 35 kernels pop.

Now, let's add up all the popped kernels:
70 (first 10 seconds) + 140 (second 10 seconds) + 280 (third 10 seconds) + 140 (final 10 seconds) + 35 (residual heat) = 665 kernels.

Noah gives one-fifth of the made popcorn to his brother Luca, so Luca gets 665 / 5 = 133 kernels.

Noah has the rest of the popcorn, so he has 665 - 133 = 532 kernels.

To find out how many more pieces of popcorn Noah has to eat than his brother, we subtract the number of kernels Luca has from the number Noah has: 532 - 133 = 399.

Noah has 399 more pieces of popcorn to eat than his brother.",399.0,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 10 seconds:** 70 kernels pop.
2. **Next 10 seconds:** The rate is 2 times the initial rate, so 70 * 2 = 140 kernels pop.
3. **Next 10 seconds:** The rate is 4 times the initial rate, so 70 * 4 = 280 kernels pop.
4. **Final 10 seconds:** The rate is half of the previous rate, so 280 / 2 = 140 kernels pop.
5. **Residual heat:** A quarter of the final 10 seconds pop, so 140 / 4 = 35 kernels pop.

Now, let's add up all the popped kernels:
70 (first 10 seconds) + 140 (second 10 seconds) + 280 (third 10 seconds) + 140 (final 10 seconds) + 35 (residual heat) = 665 kernels.

Noah gives one-fifth of the popcorn to his brother Luca:
665 / 5 = 133 kernels to Luca.

Now, let's find out how many more pieces Noah has than Luca:
665 (total kernels) - 133 (Luca's share) = 532 kernels for Noah.

The difference between Noah's and Luca's share is:
532 (Noah's share) - 133 (Luca's share) = 399.
