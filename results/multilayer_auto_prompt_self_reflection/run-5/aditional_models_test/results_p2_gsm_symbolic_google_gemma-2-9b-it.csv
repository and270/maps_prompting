   - The cost of donuts is 5 dozens * $19/dozen = $95.

**2. Calculate the cost of mini cupcakes:**

   - Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes / 12 mini cupcakes per dozen = 5 dozens of mini cupcakes.
   - The cost of mini cupcakes is 5 dozens * $33/dozen = $165.

**3. Calculate the total cost before the discount:**

   - Let 'x' represent the cost of 60 mini cheesecakes.
   - The total cost before the discount is $95 + $165 + x = $260 + x

**4. Calculate the amount of the discount:**

   - The discount is 20% of the total cost before the discount: 0.20 * ($260 + x)

**5. Set up an equation to find the cost of mini cheesecakes:**

   - Total cost before discount - discount = $1500
   - ($260 + x) - 0.20 * ($260 + x) = $1500

**6. Solve the equation for x:**

   - $260 + x - 52 - 0.20x = $1500
   - 0.80x + 208 = $1500
   - 0.80x = $1292
   - x = $1615 

**7. Calculate the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen:**

   - The cost of 60 mini cheesecakes is $1615, so the cost per dozen is $1615 / 5 = $323.

What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the cost of the donuts:**

* Donuts cost $19 per dozen, and Sophia bought 60 donuts (5 dozens).
* Cost of donuts = $19/dozen * 5 dozens = $95

**2. Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:**

* Mini cupcakes cost $33 per dozen, and Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes (5 dozens).
* Cost of mini cupcakes = $33/dozen * 5 dozens = $165

**3. Calculate the total cost before the discount:**

* Total cost before discount = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
* Let 'x' be the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen.
* Total cost before discount = $95 + $165 + 60x

**4. Calculate the discount amount:**

* Discount = 20% of the total cost before discount
* Discount = 0.20 * ($95 + $165 + 60x)

**5. Set up the equation for the final price:**

* Total price paid = Total cost before discount - Discount
* $1500 = ($95 + $165 + 60x) - 0.20 * ($95 + $165 + 60x)

1. **Calculate the cost of donuts:**
   - Sophia bought 60 donuts / 12 donuts per dozen = 5 dozens of donuts.
   - The cost of donuts is 5 dozens * $19/dozen = $95.

2. **Calculate the cost of mini cupcakes:**
   - Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes / 12 mini cupcakes per dozen = 5 dozens of mini cupcakes.
   - The cost of mini cupcakes is 5 dozens * $33/dozen = $165.

Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

**Explanation:**

My previous answers were incorrect because I failed to account for the discount and the cost of all the pastries before calculating the price of the mini cheesecakes. I likely jumped to a conclusion without properly breaking down the problem.

**Error Keywords:**

- Discount
- Calculation
- Cost Breakdown
- Total Price

**Instructions:**

1. **Calculate the cost of donuts:** 60 donuts / 12 donuts/dozen = 5 dozens * $19/dozen = $95
2. **Calculate the cost of mini cupcakes:** 60 mini cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/dozen = 5 dozens * $33/dozen = $165
3. **Calculate the original total cost:** $95 + $165 + Cost of mini cheesecakes = Original Total Cost
4. **Calculate the discount amount:** Original Total Cost * 0.20 = Discount
5. **Calculate the final price paid:** Original Total Cost - Discount = $1500
6. **Solve for the cost of mini cheesecakes:** Use the equations from steps 3, 4, and 5 to isolate the cost of mini cheesecakes.

**Advice:**

- Always start by clearly identifying all known values and what needs to be found.
- Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
- Double-check your calculations and ensure they align with the given information.
- Use variables to represent unknown values and create equations to solve for them.



**Solution:**

Let 'x' represent the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen.

1. **Cost of donuts:** $95
2. **Cost of mini cupcakes:** $165
3. **Original total cost:** $95 + $165 + x = $260 + x
4. **Discount amount:** ($260 + x) * 0.20 = $52 + 0.2x
5. **Final price paid:** $260 + x - ($52 + 0.2x) = $1500
6. **Simplify and solve for x:** 
   $208 + 0.8x = $1500
   0.8x = $1292
   x = $161.50



Therefore, the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen was **$161.50**.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 4.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answers were incorrect because I failed to account for the change in wind speed. I treated the fog's speed as constant, ignoring the crucial information about it being halved after one hour. This demonstrates a lack of attention to detail and an inability to properly analyze changing conditions within the problem.

**Error Keywords:**

- **Changing Conditions:** The wind speed is not constant.
- **Time Intervals:** The problem involves a change in speed after a specific time.
- **Rate:** The fog's speed is directly related to the wind speed.

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Calculate the initial fog speed:** The fog covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, so its speed is 4 miles / 60 minutes = 1/15 miles per minute.

2. **Determine the fog speed after one hour:** The wind speed is halved after one hour, so the fog's speed becomes (1/15 miles per minute) / 2 = 1/30 miles per minute.

3. **Calculate the time to cover 1/4 of the city:** 
    - 1/4 of the city is 80 miles / 4 = 20 miles.
    - Time = Distance / Speed
    - Time = 20 miles / (1/15 miles per minute) = 300 minutes.

4. **Account for the change in speed:** Since the fog's speed changes after one hour, we need to split the calculation:
    -  First hour: 4 miles / (1/15 miles per minute) = 60 minutes
    - Remaining distance: 16 miles (20 miles - 4 miles)
    - Time for remaining distance: 16 miles / (1/30 miles per minute) = 480 minutes

5. **Total time:** 60 minutes + 480 minutes = 540 minutes.



## Instructions for Future Problems:

1. **Identify changing conditions:** Carefully read the problem for any mentions of changes in speed, rate, or other variables over time.
2. **Break down the problem:** Divide the problem into smaller parts based on the changing conditions.
3. **Calculate rates for each part:** Determine the relevant rate for each part of the problem.
4. **Account for time intervals:**  Ensure you are using the correct time intervals for each part of the calculation.
5. **Combine results:** Add the time taken for each part to find the total time.

## General Advice:

- **Read carefully:** Pay close attention to all details and keywords in the problem.
- **Visualize:** Try to create a mental picture of the situation described in the problem.
- **Draw diagrams:** If helpful, draw a diagram to represent the problem and the changing conditions.
- **Check your units:** Ensure your units are consistent throughout the calculation.
- **Double-check your answer:** Make sure your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

* Since Nia used 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk, we know the total number of units is 240.
*  Let 'x' represent the number of cups of water used.
*  The ratio of sugar to water is 2:1, meaning for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, there is 1 cup of water.
*  Therefore, the total number of sugar units is 2 * (number of water units).

**3. Set Up an Equation:**

*  We know the total number of units is 240.  Let's represent the units as follows:
    * Sugar: 2x
    * Water: x
    * Milk: x
    * Cream: 4x 
*  The equation is: 2x + x + x + 4x = 240

**4. Solve for x:**

*  Combine like terms: 8x = 240
*  Divide both sides by 8: x = 30

**5. Calculate Sugar Used:**

*  Sugar units are 2 times the number of water units: 2 * 30 = 60 teaspoons



**Answer:** Nia used 60 teaspoons of sugar.

So, in total, there were 2 * 6 = 12 forks.
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

I incorrectly answered the question because I failed to consider all the information provided in the problem. I prematurely concluded that Aisha bought two packages of forks based on the guests bringing two packages, leading to an inaccurate calculation. This demonstrates a lack of careful reading comprehension and a tendency to jump to conclusions.

**Error Keywords:**

-  Misinterpretation
-  Incomplete Information Processing
-  Premature Conclusion

## Corrected Solution:

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Start with the known total:** Aisha had 32 forks at the end.
2. **Subtract the forks from the guests:** Guests brought 2 * 6 = 12 forks. So, Aisha had 32 - 12 = 20 forks before the guests arrived.
3. **Subtract the forks used for sampling:** Aisha used 16 forks for sampling, leaving her with 20 - 16 = 4 forks.
4. **Subtract the defective forks:** She threw away 6 defective forks, meaning she had 4 + 6 = 10 forks before her husband bought more.
5. **Subtract the forks her husband bought:** Her husband bought 8 forks, so she had 10 - 8 = 2 forks before buying her own package.
6. **Determine the number of forks in Aisha's package:** Since she started with 2 forks and ended up with 32, her package must have contained 32 - 2 = 30 forks.


## Instructions for Future Success:

1. **Read the entire problem carefully:**  Ensure you understand all the details and relationships between the given information.
2. **Identify the unknown:** Clearly define what you are trying to find.
3. **Break down the problem:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable steps.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Aisha was preparing for a lunch party at her house, where she intended to serve stuffed peppers. She noticed that she was out of plastic forks, so she bought a new package of forks. Later, her husband also bought a package of 8 new forks and gave them to Aisha. While Aisha was making the stuffed peppers, she used sixteen of the forks to sample her stuffed peppers, then threw away 6 defective forks. The guests also brought 2 packs of forks, each having 6 inside them. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 32 forks. How many forks were in the package that Aisha bought?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 12.0

Your previous reflection answers were:
Reflection 1: 28.0
Reflection 2: None
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

**Explanation:** My previous answers were incorrect because I failed to accurately track the changing number of forks throughout the scenario. I made several calculation errors and didn't properly account for the forks Aisha received, used, discarded, and those brought by guests.

**Error Keywords:**

* **Quantity Tracking:**  I struggled to keep track of the increasing and decreasing number of forks.
* **Operation Errors:** I made mistakes in addition and subtraction when calculating the total number of forks.
* **Word Problem Interpretation:** I didn't fully understand the sequence of events and how they affected the total number of forks.

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Start with the known:** Aisha ended up with 32 forks.

2. **Work backward:**
    *  Guests brought 2 packs * 6 forks/pack = 12 forks.
    *  Before the guests arrived, Aisha had 32 forks - 12 forks = 20 forks.

3. **Account for the defective forks:** Before discarding forks, Aisha had 20 forks + 6 forks = 26 forks.

4. **Account for the sampling:** Before sampling, Aisha had 26 forks + 16 forks = 42 forks.

5. **Account for her husband's purchase:** Before her husband bought forks, Aisha had 42 forks - 8 forks = 34 forks.

6. **Final Calculation:** The package Aisha bought contained 34 forks.



## Instructions for Future Problems:

1. **Read Carefully:**  Read the entire word problem multiple times to understand the context and all the actions involved.
2. **Identify Key Information:** Highlight or underline important numbers, quantities, and actions.
3. **Create a Timeline:**  If the problem involves a sequence of events, create a simple timeline to visualize the order of actions.
4. **Work Backwards:**  When possible, start with the final known quantity and work backwards through the steps to find the initial quantity.
5. **Keep Track of Changes:**  Use a separate piece of paper or a list to keep track of how quantities change at each step.
6. **Double-Check Calculations:**  Carefully check your calculations at each step to avoid errors.

## General Advice:

* **Break Down Complex Problems:** Divide complex word problems into smaller, more manageable parts.
* **Visualize:** Try to visualize the problem using diagrams or drawings to better understand the relationships between quantities.
* **Practice:**  Regularly practice solving word problems to improve your understanding and problem-solving skills.

**Error Keywords:**

- Discount
- Calculation
- Membership Comparison

**Solution:**

To find the least amount Arjun can spend, we need to calculate the total cost with both membership options and choose the lower price.

**Option 1: Membership**

1. **Calculate the total cost before discount:**
   - Folders: 12 * $4.75 = $57.00
   - Erasers: 8 * $14.50 = $116.00
   - Bond Paper: $11.00
   - Pencils: 7 * $8.00 = $56.00
   - Total cost: $57.00 + $116.00 + $11.00 + $56.00 = $230.00

2. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   - Discount: $230.00 * 0.20 = $46.00

3. **Calculate the final price with membership:**
   - Final price: $230.00 - $46.00 = $184.00

4. **Add the membership fee:**
   - Total cost with membership: $184.00 + $20.00 = $204.00

**Option 2: No Membership**

1. **Calculate the total cost before discount:** (Same as above) $230.00

2. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   - Discount: $230.00 * 0.05 = $11.50

3. **Calculate the final price without membership:**
   - Final price: $230.00 - $11.50 = $218.50

**Conclusion:**

The least amount Arjun can spend is $184.00 by becoming a member.

* Total cost: $57.00 + $116.00 + $11.00 + $56.00 = $230.00

**3. Calculate the discount for each membership option:**

* Member discount: 20% of $230.00 = $46.00
* Non-member discount: 5% of $230.00 = $11.50

**4. Calculate the final cost for each membership option:**

* Member cost: $230.00 - $46.00 = $184.00
* Non-member cost: $230.00 - $11.50 = $218.50

**5. Determine the least expensive option:**

    - Bond Paper: $11.00
    - Pencils: 7 pencils * $8.00/pencil = $56.00
2. **Calculate the total cost before any discounts:**
    - $57.00 + $116.00 + $11.00 + $56.00 = $230.00
3. **Calculate the discount for each membership option:**
    - Member Discount: 20% of $230.00 = $46.00
    - Non-Member Discount: 5% of $230.00 = $11.50
4. **Calculate the final price for each membership option:**
    - Member Price: $230.00 - $46.00 = $184.00
    - Non-Member Price: $230.00 - $11.50 = $218.50

Question: Yusuf is rolling a twenty-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row, than that he rolls four even numbers in a row?
Your initial answer was: Let's break down this probability problem step-by-step:

**Understanding the Events**

* **Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row** 
   * There are 15 numbers greater than 5 on a twenty-sided die.
   * The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 once is 15/20 = 3/4.
   * The probability of rolling it twice in a row is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

**Answer:** It is 50 percentage points more likely to roll a number greater than 5 twice in a row than to roll four even numbers in a row.
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answer was incorrect because I failed to account for the fact that the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is calculated as the probability of the first roll * the probability of the second roll.  I mistakenly treated the two rolls as independent events when they are dependent.

**Error Keywords:**

- **Dependent events:**  This is the most specific error.
- **Probability calculation error:** This is a broader category encompassing the specific mistake.
- **Misunderstanding of probability:** This highlights the fundamental conceptual error.

## Corrected Solution:

**Understanding the Events**

* **Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row** 
   * Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on the first roll: 15/20 = 3/4
   * Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on the second roll *given* that a number greater than 5 was rolled on the first: 14/19 (since one greater than 5 is gone).
   * Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row: (3/4) * (14/19) = 21/38

* **Event 2: Rolling four even numbers in a row**
   * Probability of rolling an even number: 10/20 = 1/2
   * Probability of rolling four even numbers in a row: (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16

**Finding the Difference**

* The difference in probability between the two events is (21/38) - (1/16) 
* To express this as a percentage difference, we need to convert the difference to a decimal and multiply by 100%. This requires finding a common denominator for 38 and 16, which is 608.

## Instructions for Future Success:

1. **Identify Dependent vs. Independent Events:** Carefully analyze if the events are dependent (the outcome of one affects the other) or independent (the outcome of one doesn't affect the other).
2. **Apply Correct Probability Formulas:** Use the appropriate formulas for dependent and independent events.
3. **Double-Check Calculations:**  Always verify your calculations, especially when dealing with fractions and decimals.
4. **Express Answers Clearly:**  State the answer in the requested format (percentage points in this case).

Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answer of 5.0 was incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the probabilities of both events. I likely made a mistake in counting the favorable outcomes for each event and/or in understanding how to express the difference in probabilities as a percentage point difference. 

**Error Keywords:**

- Probability Calculation
- Counting Outcomes
- Percentage Point Difference

## Corrected Solution:

**Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row**

*  Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a single roll: 15/20 = 3/4
*  Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16

**Event 2: Rolling four even numbers in a row**

How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row, than that he rolls four even numbers in a row?",50.0,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row:**

* Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a single roll: 15/20 (there are 15 numbers greater than 5 on a 20-sided die)
* Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row: (15/20) * (15/20) = 225/400 = 0.5625

*  Convert to percentage: 0.5625 * 100% = 56.25%

**2. Probability of rolling four even numbers in a row:**

* Probability of rolling an even number on a single roll: 10/20 (there are 10 even numbers on a 20-sided die)
* Probability of rolling four even numbers in a row: (10/20) * (10/20) * (10/20) * (10/20) = 10000/160000 = 0.0625

* Convert to percentage: 0.0625 * 100% = 6.25%

**3.  Difference in percentage points:**

*  56.25% - 6.25% = 50 percentage points


**Answer:** It is **50 percentage points** more likely that Yusuf rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row than that he rolls four even numbers in a row.",5.0,0,"Let's break down this probability problem step-by-step:

**Understanding the Events**

* **Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row** 
   * There are 15 numbers greater than 5 on a twenty-sided die.
   * The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 once is 15/20 = 3/4.
   * The probability of rolling it twice in a row is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

* **Event 2: Rolling four even numbers in a row**
   * There are 10 even numbers on a twenty-sided die.
   * The probability of rolling an even number once is 10/20 = 1/2.
   * The probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16.

**Finding the Difference**

* The difference in probability between the two events is (9/16) - (1/16) = 8/16 = 1/2.

* To express this as a percentage difference, we multiply by 100%: (1/2) * 100% = 50%.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Yusuf is rolling a twenty-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row, than that he rolls four even numbers in a row?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 5.0

Your previous reflection answers were:
Reflection 1: 5.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answers of 5.0 were incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the probabilities of both events. I likely made a mistake in counting the favorable outcomes for each scenario and didn't correctly apply the concept of independent events. 

**Error Keywords:**

- Probability
- Independent Events
- Counting Outcomes

## Corrected Solution:

**Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row**

*  Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a single roll: 15/20 (15 numbers are greater than 5)
*  Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row (independent events): (15/20) * (15/20) = 225/400 = 0.5625

**Event 2: Rolling four even numbers in a row**

* Probability of rolling an even number on a single roll: 10/20 (10 even numbers)
* Probability of rolling four even numbers in a row (independent events): (10/20) * (10/20) * (10/20) * (10/20) = 10000/160000 = 0.0625

**Difference in Probability:**

0.5625 - 0.0625 = 0.5

**Difference in Percentage Points:**

0.5 * 100% = 50%


## Instructions for Future Problems:

1. **Identify the Events:** Clearly define the events happening in the problem. 
2. **Determine Independence:** Analyze if the events are independent (outcome of one doesn't affect the other) or dependent (outcome of one affects the other). 
3. **Calculate Individual Probabilities:** Determine the probability of each individual event. 
4. **Adjust for Dependence:** If events are dependent, adjust probabilities based on the outcome of previous events. 
5. **Multiply Probabilities:** Multiply the probabilities of each event to find the overall probability of both events happening. 
6. **Express as Difference:** If the question asks for the difference in probability, subtract the probabilities of the two events. Convert the difference to percentage points if necessary. 

## General Advice:

* **Carefully read the problem:** Understand the wording and identify key information. 
* **Visualize the Events:** Draw diagrams or use other visual aids to help understand the relationships between events. 
* **Break down complex problems:** Divide complex problems into smaller, manageable steps. 
* **Double-check calculations:** Carefully verify your calculations to avoid arithmetic errors. 
* **Practice:** Regularly solve probability problems to improve your understanding and accuracy.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answer was incorrect because I made a fundamental error in understanding the problem. I incorrectly assumed that the 26 white animals represented the total number of beetles and bees. This led to a flawed calculation of the number of bees and ultimately an inaccurate percentage of rabbits.

**Error Keywords:**

- Misinterpretation
- Incorrect Assumption
- Logical Reasoning Error

## Corrected Solution:

**1. Find the number of beetles:**

* Mia found 2/3 as many beetles as bees. Let 'b' represent the number of bees.
* The number of beetles is (2/3) * b

**2. Find the total number of bees and beetles:**

* The total number of bees and beetles is b + (2/3) * b = (5/3) * b

**3. Find the number of bees:**

* We know there were 9 bees. So, (5/3) * b = 9 + 13  (combining bees, beetles, and rabbits)
* Simplifying: (5/3) * b = 22
* Solving for 'b': b = 22 * (3/5) = 13.2 bees (approximately)

**4. Find the number of rabbits:**

* Half of the 26 white animals were rabbits, so there are 26 / 2 = 13 rabbits.

**5. Calculate the total number of animals:**

* Total animals = 13.2 bees + 13.2 beetles + 13 rabbits + 24 wasps = 63.4 animals (approximately)

**6. Calculate the percentage of rabbits:**

* Percentage of rabbits = (13 / 63.4) * 100% = 20.5% (approximately)



**Answer:** Approximately 20.5% of the animals in the plot were rabbits.

Mia then found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. In addition, she saw 24 wasps, and 9 bees. What percentage of animals in the plot were rabbits?",20.0,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Find the number of rabbits:**

* Mia saw 26 white animals, and half were rabbits, so there were 26 / 2 = 13 rabbits.

**2. Find the total number of animals:**

*  Total animals = rabbits + bees + wasps + beetles 
*  We know rabbits = 13, bees = 9, and we need to find beetles.

**3. Find the number of beetles:**

* Mia found 2/3 as many beetles as bees, so there were (2/3) * 9 = 6 beetles.

**4. Calculate the total number of animals:**

* Total animals = 13 + 9 + 24 + 6 = 52 animals

**5. Calculate the percentage of rabbits:**

* Percentage of rabbits = (number of rabbits / total number of animals) * 100%
* Percentage of rabbits = (13 / 52) * 100% = 25%

**1. Find the number of bees:**

* Mia found 2/3 as many beetles as bees, and there were 26 white animals total.
* Since half of the white animals were rabbits, there were 26 / 2 = 13 rabbits.
* This means there were 26 - 13 = 13 beetles and bees combined.
* Let 'b' represent the number of bees.  We know: b + 13 = 26
* Solving for 'b', we get b = 13 bees.

**2. Find the total number of animals:**

* There were 13 bees, 13 beetles, 13 rabbits, and 9 wasps.
* The total number of animals is 13 + 13 + 13 + 9 = 48 animals.

**3. Calculate the percentage of rabbits:**

* The percentage of rabbits is (number of rabbits / total number of animals) * 100%

Question: Mrs. Lee is looking for a new townhouse that will not go beyond her $340000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $400000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?
Your initial answer was: A: Let's think step by step...

1. **Calculate the discount:** 25% of $400,000 is (25/100) * $400,000 = $100,000.

2. **Calculate the price after the discount:** The price after the discount is $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000.

3. **Calculate the brokerage fee:** 5% of $400,000 is (5/100) * $400,000 = $20,000.

4. **Calculate the transfer fee:** 12% of $400,000 is (12/100) * $400,000 = $48,000.

5. **Calculate the total cost:** The total cost is $300,000 + $20,000 + $48,000 = $368,000.

6. **Calculate the difference from Mrs. Lee's budget:** The difference is $368,000 - $340,000 = $28,000.


The answer is $28,000.
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answer was incorrect because I calculated the brokerage fee and transfer fee based on the original selling price of $400,000 instead of the discounted price of $300,000. This was a significant error in logic, as the fees are calculated based on the final price Mrs. Lee would pay.

**Error Keywords:**

- Logic error
- Calculation error
- Misapplication of information

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Calculate the discount:** 25% of $400,000 is (25/100) * $400,000 = $100,000.

2. **Calculate the price after the discount:** The price after the discount is $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000.

p2,gsm-symbolic,google/gemma-2-9b-it,"Dr. Brown sold his villa for $550000. He paid the legal fees that amounted to 2% of the selling price and also paid a realtor fee that is 5% of the selling price. He also paid $440000 for the remaining loan amount on the villa, and $5000 for closing costs. Dr. Brown used the net proceeds from selling the villa to invest in stocks. The stocks gained 10% each year for two years. How much were Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years?",80465.0,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the legal fees:**

* Legal fees = 2% of $550,000 = (2/100) * $550,000 = $11,000

**2. Calculate the realtor fees:**

* Realtor fees = 5% of $550,000 = (5/100) * $550,000 = $27,500

**3. Calculate the total expenses:**

* Total expenses = Legal fees + Realtor fees + Loan amount + Closing costs
* Total expenses = $11,000 + $27,500 + $440,000 + $5,000 = $483,500

**4. Calculate the net proceeds from selling the villa:**

* Net proceeds = Selling price - Total expenses
* Net proceeds = $550,000 - $483,500 = $66,500

**5. Calculate the stock gains in the first year:**

* Gain in year 1 = 10% of $66,500 = (10/100) * $66,500 = $6,650

**6. Calculate the value of the stocks after the first year:**

* Value after year 1 = Net proceeds + Gain in year 1
* Value after year 1 = $66,500 + $6,650 = $73,150

**7. Calculate the stock gains in the second year:**

* Gain in year 2 = 10% of $73,150 = (10/100) * $73,150 = $7,315

**8. Calculate the final value of the stocks after two years:**

* Final value = Value after year 1 + Gain in year 2
* Final value = $73,150 + $7,315 = $80,465

*  Priya bought 21 kgs of fudge, which is more than the 15 kgs needed for the discount.
*  The discount applies to 4 kgs at 1/4 off: 4 kgs * ₺22/kg * (1/4) = ₺22/kg * 1 kg = ₺2.20
*  The cost of the fudge with the discount is: (15 kgs * ₺22/kg) + (6 kgs * ₺22/kg - ₺2.20) = ₺330 + ₺132 - ₺2.20 = ₺460.80

**Answer:** Priya has ₺471.20 left.",471.2,0,"A: Let's think step by step to figure out how much money Priya has left.

**1. Calculate the cost of the fudge:**

* Priya bought 21 kgs of fudge.
* The sale price is ₺22 per kg for the first 15 kgs, so that's 15 * ₺22 = ₺330.
* She gets 4 kgs at 1/4 off, which is ₺22 * 0.25 = ₺5.50 off per kg.
* The discounted price for those 4 kgs is ₺22 - ₺5.50 = ₺16.50 per kg.
* The cost of the discounted fudge is 4 * ₺16.50 = ₺66.
* The total cost of the fudge is ₺330 + ₺66 = ₺396.

**2. Calculate the cost of the postcards:**

* Priya bought 12 postcards at ₺21.0 each, so they cost 12 * ₺21.0 = ₺252.

**3. Calculate Priya's total spending:**

* Her total spending is ₺396 (fudge) + ₺11 (sand dollars) + ₺252 (postcards) = ₺659.

**4. Calculate Priya's remaining money:**

* Priya started with ₺1200 and spent ₺659, leaving her with ₺1200 - ₺659 = ₺541.

**1. Calculate the cost of the fudge:**

*  Priya bought 21 kgs of fudge, which is more than the 15 kgs needed for the discount.
*  The discount applies to 4 kgs at 1/4 off: 4 kgs * ₺22/kg * (1/4) = ₺22/kg * 1 kg = ₺2.20
*  The cost of the fudge with the discount is: (15 kgs * ₺22/kg) + (6 kgs * ₺22/kg - ₺2.20) = ₺330 + ₺132 - ₺2.20 = ₺460.80

**2. Calculate the cost of the postcards:**

*  12 postcards * ₺21.0/postcard = ₺252.00

**3. Calculate Priya's total spending:**

*  ₺460.80 (fudge) + ₺11.00 (sand dollars) + ₺252.00 (postcards) + ₺5.00 (donation) = ₺728.80

**4. Calculate Priya's remaining money:**

**Error Keywords:**

- Discounts
- Multiple Purchases
- Money Calculations
- Addition

**Solution:**

1. **Fudge Cost:**
    -  21 kgs of fudge is more than 15 kgs, so we'll calculate the cost in two parts:
        - 15 kgs at ₺22/kg = 15 * 22 = ₺330
        - Remaining 6 kgs (21-15) get a 1/4 discount: 6 * 22 * (3/4) = ₺49.50
    - Total fudge cost: ₺330 + ₺49.50 = ₺379.50

2. **Total Expenses:**
    - Fudge: ₺379.50
    - Sand dollars: ₺11.00
    - Postcards: 12 * ₺21.00 = ₺252.00
    - Total expenses: ₺379.50 + ₺11.00 + ₺252.00 = ₺642.50

3. **Remaining Money:**
    - Starting money: ₺1200.00

How much money does Priya have left?",492.0,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the cost of the fudge:**

*  Priya bought 21 kgs of fudge, which is more than the 15 kgs needed for the discount.
*  The discount applies to 4 kgs at 1/4 off: 4 kgs * ₺22/kg * (1/4) = ₺22/kg * 1 kg = ₺2.20
*  The cost of the fudge with the discount is: (15 kgs * ₺22/kg) + (6 kgs * ₺22/kg - ₺2.20) = ₺330 + ₺132 - ₺2.20 = ₺460.80

**2. Calculate the cost of the postcards:**

*  12 postcards * ₺21.0/postcard = ₺252.00

**3. Calculate Priya's total spending:**

*  ₺460.80 (fudge) + ₺11.00 (sand dollars) + ₺252.00 (postcards) + ₺5.00 (donation) = ₺728.80

**4. Calculate Priya's remaining money:**

*  ₺1200.00 (starting money) - ₺728.80 (spending) = ₺471.20



**Answer:** Priya has ₺471.20 left.",471.2,0,"A: Let's think step by step to figure out how much money Priya has left.

**1. Calculate the cost of the fudge:**

* Priya bought 21 kgs of fudge.
* The sale price is ₺22 per kg for the first 15 kgs, so that's 15 * ₺22 = ₺330.
* She gets 4 kgs at 1/4 off, which is ₺22 * 0.25 = ₺5.50 off per kg.
* The discounted price for those 4 kgs is ₺22 - ₺5.50 = ₺16.50 per kg.
* The cost of the discounted fudge is 4 * ₺16.50 = ₺66.
* The total cost of the fudge is ₺330 + ₺66 = ₺396.

**2. Calculate the cost of the postcards:**

* Priya bought 12 postcards at ₺21.0 each, so they cost 12 * ₺21.0 = ₺252.

**3. Calculate Priya's total spending:**

* Her total spending is ₺396 (fudge) + ₺11 (sand dollars) + ₺252 (postcards) = ₺659.

**4. Calculate Priya's remaining money:**

* Priya started with ₺1200 and spent ₺659, leaving her with ₺1200 - ₺659 = ₺541.

**5. Account for the donation:**

* After donating ₺5, Priya has ₺541 - ₺5 = ₺536 left.

Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","You are absolutely right! My previous attempts were incorrect. I made a few key errors:

* **I didn't calculate the discount on the fudge correctly.** I didn't account for the fact that the discount was applied to 4 kgs out of the 15 kgs she bought.
* **I didn't keep track of all the expenses separately.**  I likely added up the costs without being careful about which items were included.

Here's a step-by-step solution with corrections:

**1. Calculate the cost of the fudge:**

*  15 kgs * ₺22/kg = ₺330
*  Discount on 4 kgs: 4 kgs * ₺22/kg * (1/4) = ₺22
*  Total cost of fudge: ₺330 - ₺22 = ₺308

**[Example Input]**

Question: Sarah baked 36 cookies. She gave 1/4 of them to her friends and then ate 1/3 of the remaining cookies. What percentage of the original cookies are left?

Wrong answer: 50%

**[Example Output]**

Explanation: 
I incorrectly calculated the number of cookies remaining after Sarah gave some to her friends. I didn't account for the fact that she ate some of the remaining cookies.

Error Keywords:
- Percentage calculation
- Fractions
- Word problem interpretation

Instructions:
1. Calculate the number of cookies given to friends.
2. Subtract that number from the total cookies to find the remaining cookies.
3. Calculate the number of cookies eaten.
4. Subtract the eaten cookies from the remaining cookies to find the final number of cookies.
5. Divide the final number of cookies by the original number of cookies and multiply by 100 to find the percentage.

Advice:
- Carefully read and understand the problem before attempting to solve it.
- Pay attention to the order of operations.
- Double-check your calculations.

Solution:
1. Sarah gave away 36 * (1/4) = 9 cookies.

Carlos has 720 almonds, 7 bowls and 3 tables. Unfortunately, 2 tables break. Carlos then eats one-fifth of all the almonds. How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?",14.0,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the capacity of each table:**

* Each table holds three times the capacity of a bowl: 24 almonds/bowl * 3 = 72 almonds/table

**2. Calculate the total capacity of all tables:**

* Total table capacity: 72 almonds/table * 3 tables = 216 almonds

**3. Calculate the total capacity of all bowls:**

* Total bowl capacity: 24 almonds/bowl * 7 bowls = 168 almonds

**4. Calculate the total capacity of all bowls and tables:**

* Total capacity: 216 almonds + 168 almonds = 384 almonds

**5. Calculate the number of almonds remaining after the tables break:**

*  Carlos loses two tables worth of capacity: 72 almonds/table * 2 tables = 144 almonds
*  Total almonds remaining: 720 almonds - 144 almonds = 576 almonds

**6. Calculate the number of almonds Carlos eats:**

* Almonds eaten: 576 almonds * (1/5) = 115.2 almonds 
* Since Carlos can't eat part of an almond, we'll round this down to 115 almonds.

**7. Calculate the number of almonds remaining after Carlos eats some:**

* Almonds remaining: 576 almonds - 115 almonds = 461 almonds

**8. Calculate the number of bowls needed for the remaining almonds:**

* Number of bowls needed: 461 almonds / 24 almonds/bowl = 19.21 bowls

* Since Carlos can't have a fraction of a bowl, he needs 20 more bowls.

**Explanation:**

My previous answers were incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the ages of all four individuals in 4 years. I likely made a mistake in either adding or subtracting the correct number of years to each person's current age. Additionally, I didn't correctly calculate the average of the four ages.

**Error Keywords:**

- Age calculation
- Future age
- Average calculation
- Arithmetic errors

**Solution:**

1. **Diego in 4 years:** 19 + 4 = 23 years old
2. **Aisha in 9 years:** 19 * 2 = 38 years old
3. **Aisha in 4 years:** 38 - 5 = 33 years old
4. **Esteban in 4 years:** 19 - 6 + 4 = 17 years old
5. **Nadia in 4 years:** 17 + 10 + 4 = 31 years old
6. **Average age in 4 years:** (23 + 33 + 17 + 31) / 4 = **26 years old**


**Instructions:**

1.  **Identify future ages:** Determine the age of each person in the specified future time (4 years in this case).
2.  **Calculate individual ages:**  Add or subtract the appropriate number of years to each person's current age to find their future age.
3.  **Sum the ages:** Add up the future ages of all individuals.
4.  **Divide for average:** Divide the sum of the ages by the number of individuals to find the average age.

**General Advice:**

* **Read carefully:** Pay close attention to the details of the problem, including the time frame and the relationships between individuals.
* **Break it down:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
* **Use variables:** Consider using variables to represent unknown ages, making calculations clearer.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Keisha is knitting winter wear for her 4 grandchildren. They're quadruplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a shawl, sweater, poncho, gloves, and mittens for each of them. It takes 5 skeins of wool to make a shawl, 6 for a sweater, 8 for a poncho, 8 for a pair of gloves, and 14 for a pair of mittens. Keisha wants to make two warm jackets for herself, each needing 8 skeins of wool. Each dozen skeins of wool costs $7. The store has a promotion where customers receive a $20 discount on purchases over $100. How much should Keisha pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 64.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection:

I incorrectly answered the question because I failed to calculate the total skeins needed for all items, including Keisha's jackets, and I didn't apply the discount correctly. 

**Error Keywords:** 

- Calculation 
- Discount 
- Quantity 
- Multiple Steps 

## Solution: 

Here's the breakdown of Keisha's wool expenses:

1. **Grandchildren's Clothing:**
    - Each grandchild needs: 5 (shawl) + 6 (sweater) + 8 (poncho) + 8 (gloves) + 14 (mittens) = 41 skeins 
    - Total skeins for 4 grandchildren: 41 skeins/grandchild * 4 grandchildren = 164 skeins

2. **Keisha's Jackets:** 
    - Total skeins for jackets: 8 skeins/jacket * 2 jackets = 16 skeins

3. **Total Skeins:** 164 skeins (grandchildren) + 16 skeins (jackets) = 180 skeins

4. **Cost Before Discount:** 180 skeins / 12 skeins/dozen = 15 dozens 
    - Cost: 15 dozens * $7/dozen = $105

5. **Discount:** Since Keisha's purchase is over $100, she gets a $20 discount.

6. **Final Cost:** $105 - $20 = $85


**Therefore, Keisha should pay $85 for all the skeins of wool.** 



## Instructions: 

1. **Identify all items:** List every item needing calculation. 
2. **Calculate quantities:** Determine the quantity needed for each item. 
3. **Calculate subtotal:** Multiply the quantity of each item by its price. 
4. **Calculate total:** Add up all the subtotals. 
5. **Apply discounts:** Subtract any discounts from the total. 
6. **Round:** Round the final price to the nearest cent if necessary. 

## General Advice: 

- **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable steps. 
- **Double-check calculations:** Carefully review each step to avoid errors. 
- **Pay attention to units:** Ensure units are consistent throughout the calculation. 
- **Read carefully:** Understand the entire problem, including any conditions or promotions.

Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Keisha's Wool Purchase

**Why I answered incorrectly:**

My previous answer of 64.0 was a gross oversimplification. I failed to account for the individual quantities of wool needed for each item, the cost per dozen skeins, and the discount applied. 

**Keywords describing my errors (general to specific):**

*   **Calculation:**  I made fundamental errors in calculating the total wool needed and the overall cost.
*   **Itemization:** I didn't break down the problem into individual item costs.
*   **Discount Application:** I didn't correctly apply the discount based on the purchase amount.
*   **Unit Conversion:** I didn't properly convert the cost per dozen to the cost per skein.

**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Calculate wool needed for grandchildren:**
    *   Shawl: 4 grandchildren * 5 skeins/shawl = 20 skeins
    *   Sweater: 4 grandchildren * 6 skeins/sweater = 24 skeins
    *   Poncho: 4 grandchildren * 8 skeins/poncho = 32 skeins
    *   Gloves: 4 grandchildren * 8 skeins/gloves = 32 skeins
    *   Mittens: 4 grandchildren * 14 skeins/mittens = 56 skeins
    *   Total for grandchildren: 20 + 24 + 32 + 32 + 56 = 164 skeins

2. **Calculate wool needed for jackets:**
    *   2 jackets * 8 skeins/jacket = 16 skeins

3. **Calculate total wool needed:**
    *   164 skeins (grandchildren) + 16 skeins (jackets) = 180 skeins

4. **Calculate cost of wool:**
    *   180 skeins / 12 skeins/dozen = 15 dozens
    *   15 dozens * $7/dozen = $105

5. **Apply discount:**
    *   Since the purchase is over $100, apply the $20 discount.
    *   $105 - $20 = $85


**Detailed instructions for future problems:**

1. **Identify all items and their quantities:** List each item Keisha needs and the number of each.
2. **Determine the wool needed per item:**  Find the number of skeins required for each item.
3. **Calculate total wool needed:** Sum the wool needed for all items.
4. **Convert to dozens:** Divide the total skeins by 12 to find the number of dozens needed.
5. **Calculate cost:** Multiply the number of dozens by the cost per dozen.
6. **Apply discount:** If applicable, subtract the discount amount from the total cost.

**General advice for similar problems:**

*   **Read carefully:** Understand the specific items, quantities, and discount conditions.
*   **Break it down:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
*   **Label clearly:** Use labels for each calculation to avoid confusion.

Question: Mohammed goes to the store to buy some rice. The normal brand of rice he buys costs ¥15 per kg. He has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 3 kgs of rice per day. The store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs; any additional rice is sold at the regular price. Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2. How much does Mohammed have to pay?
Your initial answer was: A: Let's think step by step:

1. **Calculate the price increase:** The more expensive rice costs 20% more than ¥15, so the increase is 0.20 * ¥15 = ¥3.

2. **Calculate the price of the expensive rice:** The price of the expensive rice is ¥15 + ¥3 = ¥18 per kg.

3. **Calculate the total rice needed for the week:** Mohammed uses 3 kg of rice per day for a week (7 days), so he needs 3 * 7 = 21 kg of rice.

4. **Calculate the discount amount:** The discount is 40% of the first 10 kg, which is 0.40 * 10 = ¥4.

5. **Calculate the price of the discounted rice:** The price of the first 10 kg of rice after the discount is ¥18 * 10 - ¥4 = ¥176.

6. **Calculate the price of the remaining rice:** Mohammed needs 21 kg of rice, and the discount only applies to the first 10 kg, so he needs to buy 21 - 10 = 11 kg of rice at the regular price.

p2,gsm-symbolic,google/gemma-2-9b-it,Mohammed goes to the store to buy some rice. The normal brand of rice he buys costs ¥15 per kg. He has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 3 kgs of rice per day. The store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs; any additional rice is sold at the regular price. Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2. How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,"Here's how to solve Mohammed's shopping trip step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the price increase:**

* The expensive rice costs 20% more than the normal price: 15 ¥ * 0.20 = 3 ¥ increase.
* The new price of the expensive rice is: 15 ¥ + 3 ¥ = 18 ¥ per kg.

**2. Calculate the total rice needed:**

* Mohammed needs 3 kg of rice per day for a week: 3 kg/day * 7 days/week = 21 kg.

**3. Calculate the discounted rice price:**

* The discount applies up to 10 kg: 10 kg * 0.40 = 4 ¥ discount per kg.
* The discounted price of the rice is: 18 ¥ - 4 ¥ = 14 ¥ per kg.

**4. Calculate the cost of discounted rice:**

* Cost of 10 kg of discounted rice: 10 kg * 14 ¥/kg = 140 ¥.

**5. Calculate the cost of rice above the discount:**

* Mohammed needs 21 kg of rice, and 10 kg are discounted: 21 kg - 10 kg = 11 kg.
* Cost of 11 kg of regular price rice: 11 kg * 18 ¥/kg = 198 ¥.

**6. Calculate the total rice cost:**

* Total rice cost: 140 ¥ + 198 ¥ = 338 ¥.

**7. Calculate the total cost:**

* Total cost including the bagel: 338 ¥ + 2 ¥ = 340 ¥.



**Therefore, Mohammed has to pay 340 ¥.**",340.0,0,"A: Let's think step by step:

1. **Calculate the price increase:** The more expensive rice costs 20% more than ¥15, so the increase is 0.20 * ¥15 = ¥3.

2. **Calculate the price of the expensive rice:** The price of the expensive rice is ¥15 + ¥3 = ¥18 per kg.

3. **Calculate the total rice needed for the week:** Mohammed uses 3 kg of rice per day for a week (7 days), so he needs 3 * 7 = 21 kg of rice.

4. **Calculate the discount amount:** The discount is 40% of the first 10 kg, which is 0.40 * 10 = ¥4.

5. **Calculate the price of the discounted rice:** The price of the first 10 kg of rice after the discount is ¥18 * 10 - ¥4 = ¥176.

6. **Calculate the price of the remaining rice:** Mohammed needs 21 kg of rice, and the discount only applies to the first 10 kg, so he needs to buy 21 - 10 = 11 kg of rice at the regular price.

7. **Calculate the price of the remaining rice:** The price of the remaining rice is ¥18 * 11 = ¥198.

8. **Calculate the total price of the rice:** The total price of the rice is ¥176 + ¥198 = ¥374.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Mohammed goes to the store to buy some rice. The normal brand of rice he buys costs ¥15 per kg. He has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 3 kgs of rice per day. The store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs; any additional rice is sold at the regular price. Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2. How much does Mohammed have to pay?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 376.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answer of ¥376.0 was incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the cost of the more expensive rice, the discounted price, and the cost of the additional rice beyond the discount limit. I also didn't account for the cost of the bagel. 

**Error Keywords:**

- Price Calculation
- Discount Application
- Percentage
- Multiple Steps

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Calculate the price of the more expensive rice:** 
   - 20% of ¥15 = (20/100) * ¥15 = ¥3
   - Price of the more expensive rice = ¥15 + ¥3 = ¥18 per kg

2. **Calculate the total rice needed:**
   - Rice per day = 3 kg
   - Rice for a week = 3 kg/day * 7 days = 21 kg

3. **Calculate the discounted price of the rice:**
   - Discount limit = 10 kg
   - Discounted rice price = ¥18/kg * 10 kg * 0.40 = ¥72

4. **Calculate the price of the rice beyond the discount limit:**
   - Rice beyond discount = 21 kg - 10 kg = 11 kg
   - Price of rice beyond discount = ¥18/kg * 11 kg = ¥198

5. **Calculate the total cost of the rice:**
   - Total rice cost = ¥72 + ¥198 = ¥270

6. **Calculate the total cost including the bagel:**
   - Total cost = ¥270 + ¥2 = ¥272



## Instructions for Future Success:

1. **Break down the problem:** Identify all relevant information and separate it into manageable steps.
2. **Calculate individual components:** Determine the price of the more expensive rice, the discounted price, and the price of rice beyond the discount limit separately.
3. **Apply discounts accurately:** Ensure you understand the discount percentage and its application limit.
4. **Sum up all costs:** Add the cost of the rice, the bagel, and any other relevant expenses.
5. **Double-check calculations:** Review your work for accuracy and ensure you haven't made any arithmetic errors.

## General Advice:

- **Read carefully:** Pay close attention to the details of the problem and identify all relevant information.
- **Visualize the problem:** Try to create a mental picture of the situation to better understand the relationships between different elements.
- **Use clear labels:** Label your calculations and variables to avoid confusion.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answer was incorrect because I failed to accurately account for the time spent returning home and back to the gym. I only considered the initial time spent walking to the gym and didn't factor in the round trip back home. 

**Error Keywords:**

- **Time Management:**  I didn't properly manage the sequence of events and their associated time durations.
- **Traversal:** I didn't correctly account for the back-and-forth movement between the gym and home.
- **Subtraction:** I likely made a calculation error when subtracting the total time spent on the detour from the initial time available.

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Calculate total time spent on the detour:** 16 minutes (to the corner) + 52 minutes (to the gym) + 16 minutes (back to home) + 52 minutes (back to gym) = 136 minutes.

2. **Calculate remaining time:** 246 minutes (total time) - 136 minutes (detour) = 110 minutes.


## Instructions for Future Success:

1. **Visualize the Path:**  Draw a simple diagram to represent the route and the back-and-forth movement.
2. **Break Down the Problem:**  Identify each distinct segment of the journey and its associated time.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Sofia and Benjamin have 246 minutes to walk to the mall together starting from their home. It takes them 16 minutes to get to the corner where the cinema is. It takes them another 52 minutes to get to the gym. When they reach the gym, they remember they forgot their wallets at home, so they have to return to pick up their wallets and then walk all the way back to the gym again. Once they reach the gym for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the mall without being late?

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answers were incorrect because I failed to accurately track the time spent on each leg of the journey. I didn't properly account for the backtracking to retrieve the wallets, which significantly impacted the remaining time available. 

**Error Keywords:**

* **Time Management:**  I mismanaged the time spent on the return trip.
* **Direction Changes:** I didn't correctly account for the change in direction and the additional time it took.
* **Calculation Errors:** I likely made arithmetic errors when calculating the remaining time.

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Time to the gym:** Sofia and Benjamin take 16 minutes to the corner + 52 minutes to the gym = 68 minutes.

2. **Time to return home:** They need to walk back home from the gym, so this takes another 52 minutes.

3. **Total time spent:**  68 minutes (to the gym) + 52 minutes (back home) = 120 minutes.

4. **Remaining time:** They started with 246 minutes and have already spent 120 minutes, leaving 246 - 120 = 126 minutes.

5. **Time to the mall:** They need to walk back to the gym (52 minutes) and then to the mall.  The total time for this is 52 minutes +  (unknown time to the mall).

6. **Unknown time to the mall:**  We know they have 126 minutes remaining.  Therefore, the time to the mall must be less than 126 minutes.


## Instructions for Future Problems:

1. **Visualize the Journey:** Draw a simple diagram to represent the movements, changes in direction, and distances involved.
2. **Break Down the Problem:** Divide the journey into distinct segments (e.g., home to corner, corner to gym, gym to home, home to gym, gym to mall).
3. **Calculate Time for Each Segment:** Determine the time spent on each segment based on the given information.
4. **Account for Direction Changes:**  Remember to add the time spent returning when direction changes occur.
5. **Track Total Time:**  Keep a running total of the time spent on each segment to avoid losing track.
6. **Calculate Remaining Time:** Subtract the total time spent from the initial time allowance to find the remaining time.

## General Advice:

* **Read Carefully:** Pay close attention to all the details and keywords in the problem.
* **Identify Key Information:**  Highlight or underline important data like distances, speeds, and time intervals.
* **Check Units:** Ensure that all units of measurement are consistent.
* **Double-Check Calculations:**  Review your calculations carefully to avoid arithmetic errors.
* **Practice:**  Solving more word problems will help you develop your problem-solving skills and improve your accuracy.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer

My previous answer of 125.0 ounces was incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the water used for each type of cube and then sum those amounts. I likely made a mistake in either calculating the water used for the small and tiny cubes or in adding up the total water used. 

**Error Keywords:**

- **Unit conversion:** While not directly involved in this problem, it's important to be mindful of units in general.
- **Fractions:**  I likely struggled with accurately calculating the water used for the small and tiny cubes, which involve fractions.
- **Multiple quantities:** I failed to keep track of the water used for each type of cube and add them correctly.

## Corrected Solution

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Giant Cubes:** 10 giant cubes * 12 ounces/cube = 120 ounces
2. **Medium Cubes:** 12 medium cubes * 5 ounces/cube = 60 ounces
3. **Small Cubes:** 14 small cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 7 ounces
4. **Tiny Cubes:** 
    - Tiny cubes are half the size of small cubes, so they use 0.5 ounces / 2 = 0.25 ounces per cube.
    -  Total tiny cubes: 48 total cubes - 10 giant cubes - 14 small cubes - 12 medium cubes = 12 tiny cubes.
    - Water used for tiny cubes: 12 tiny cubes * 0.25 ounces/cube = 3 ounces
5. **Total Water Used:** 120 ounces + 60 ounces + 7 ounces + 3 ounces = 190 ounces
6. **Water Remaining:** 312 ounces - 190 ounces = 122 ounces


## Instructions for Future Problems

1. **Identify the units:** Determine the units used for all measurements (e.g., ounces, liters, centimeters).
2. **Calculate water used per cube:**  For each cube type, multiply the number of cubes by the water used per cube.
3. **Calculate total water used:** Add up the water used for each cube type.
4. **Subtract to find remaining water:** Subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water.

## General Advice

- **Read carefully:** Understand the problem completely before starting calculations.
- **Break down the problem:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
- **Show your work:** Write down each calculation clearly to avoid errors and track your progress.
- **Double-check your answers:**  Ensure your units are consistent and your calculations are accurate. 
- **Practice:**  Solving more word problems will help you improve your skills and identify common pitfalls.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

Question: Faisal is selling muffins and apricot pies for a fundraiser. On Wednesday, he sold 27 boxes of muffin and 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie, than on Thursday. On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday and 21 boxes of apricot pie. On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?
Your initial answer was: A: Let's think step by step to solve this problem:

**Wednesday:**

*  Muffin boxes: 27
*  Apricot pie boxes: 27 - 13 = 14

**Thursday:**

* Muffin boxes: 27 + 11 = 38
* Apricot pie boxes: 21

**Friday:**

* Total boxes sold: (27 + 38) + (14 + 21) = 100 boxes

**Earnings:**

* Wednesday earnings: (27 * ₺9) + (14 * ₺21) = ₺243 + ₺294 = ₺537
* Thursday earnings: (38 * ₺9) + (21 * ₺21) = ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783
* Friday earnings: (100 * ₺9) + (100 * ₺21) = ₺900 + ₺2100 = ₺3000

**Total Earnings:** ₺537 + ₺783 + ₺3000 = ₺4320

**Average Daily Earnings:** ₺4320 / 3 days = ₺1440 per day




**Therefore, Faisal's average daily earning was ₺1440.**

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answers were incorrect because I struggled to accurately track the changing quantities of muffins and pies sold each day. I likely made calculation errors and didn't properly account for the ""fewer"" and ""more"" relationships described in the problem. 

**Error Keywords:**

* **Quantity Tracking:**  I failed to keep track of the changing quantities of muffins and pies accurately.
* **Relationship Understanding:** I didn't fully grasp the ""fewer"" and ""more"" relationships between days.
* **Calculation Accuracy:** I likely made arithmetic errors when calculating the total sales for each day.

## Corrected Solution:

**Wednesday:**

* Muffins: 27 boxes
* Pies: 27 - 13 = 14 boxes
* Wednesday's Total Earnings: (27 * ₺9) + (14 * ₺21) = ₺243 + ₺294 = ₺537

**Thursday:**

* Muffins: 27 + 11 = 38 boxes
* Pies: 21 boxes
* Thursday's Total Earnings: (38 * ₺9) + (21 * ₺21) = ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783

**Friday:**

* Muffins: 27 + 38 = 65 boxes
* Pies: 14 + 21 = 35 boxes
* Friday's Total Earnings: (65 * ₺9) + (35 * ₺21) = ₺585 + ₺735 = ₺1320

**Total Earnings:** ₺537 + ₺783 + ₺1320 = ₺2640

**Average Daily Earnings:** ₺2640 / 3 days = ₺880 per day

How much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",31.0,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the total space needed:**

* Olga needs 12 meters of space between each plant, plus the 3 meters width of each plant, for a total of 12 + 3 = 15 meters per plant.

**2. Determine the number of plants needed:**

* Divide the total length of the flower bed by the space needed per plant: 132 meters / 15 meters/plant = 8.8 plants.
* Since Olga can't have parts of plants, she'll need to buy 9 plants.

Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 13.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

**Explanation:** My previous answer of 13.0 was completely incorrect. I failed to consider several crucial factors in the problem:

* **Spacing between plants:** I didn't account for the 12-meter spacing required between each plant, which significantly affects the number of plants needed.
* **Discount:** I overlooked the discount offered for buying more than 2 plants.
* **Total cost calculation:** I didn't properly calculate the total cost based on the number of plants purchased and the discount.

**Error Keywords:**

* **Spacing**
* **Discount**
* **Plant calculation**
* **Cost calculation**

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Calculate the total space needed:** 132 meters (flower bed length) / 3 meters (plant width) = 44 spaces for plants.
2. **Account for spacing:** 44 spaces - 1 = 43 spaces between plants.
3. **Determine the number of plants:** Olga needs 43 spaces + 7 existing plants = 50 plants.
4. **Calculate the cost before discount:** 50 plants * ₣9/plant = ₣450.
5. **Apply the discount:** Since Olga buys more than 2 plants, she gets a ₣5 discount.
6. **Calculate the final cost:** ₣450 - ₣5 = ₣445.


## Instructions for Future Success:

1. **Read the problem carefully:** Pay attention to all details, including dimensions, spacing requirements, and discounts.
2. **Break down the problem:** Identify the key steps needed to solve the problem.
3. **Calculate accurately:** Double-check your calculations to avoid errors.
4. **Consider all factors:** Ensure you account for all relevant information, including discounts and spacing.

**Explanation:** My previous answers were incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the number of plants Olga needs, the total cost before the discount, and the final cost after applying the discount. I likely made careless arithmetic errors and didn't fully consider the spacing requirements between plants.

**Error Keywords:**

- Calculation error
- Spacing
- Discount application

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total space needed:** 132 meters (flower bed length) / 3 meters (plant width) = 44 spaces for plants.
2. **Account for spacing:** 44 spaces + 11 spaces (for spacing between plants) = 55 total spaces.
3. **Determine the number of plants needed:** 55 total spaces - 7 existing plants = 48 new plants.
4. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:** 48 new plants * ₣9/plant = ₣432.
5. **Apply the discount:** Since Olga buys more than 2 plants, she gets a ₣5 discount.
6. **Calculate the final cost:** ₣432 - ₣5 = ₣427.

How many minutes will it take her to peel and saute 150 clams if it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam before peeling it? Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.,163.0,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the time to peel 150 clams:**

* Time per clam to peel: 1 minute / 6 clams = 1/6 minute per clam
* Total time to peel 150 clams: (1/6 minute/clam) * 150 clams = 25 minutes

**2. Calculate the time to wash 150 clams:**

* Time per clam to wash: 12 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 0.2 minutes per clam
* Total time to wash 150 clams: (0.2 minutes/clam) * 150 clams = 30 minutes

**3. Calculate the total time to peel and wash the clams:**

* Total time: 25 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (washing) = 55 minutes

**4. Calculate the total time to sauté the clams:**

* Olga can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes, so she'll need 19 minutes * (150 clams / 30 clams) = 95 minutes to sauté 150 clams.

How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?",1755.0,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total daily pizza consumption**

* Uncle: 10 pizzas
* Spouse: 20 pizzas
* Total: 10 + 20 = 30 pizzas

**Step 2: Calculate the grandchild's daily pizza consumption**

* Grandchild eats 2/4 (or 0.5) of the combined parents' consumption: 0.5 * 30 = 15 pizzas

**Step 3: Calculate the total daily pizza consumption for the family**

* Total daily consumption: 10 + 20 + 15 = 45 pizzas

**Step 4: Calculate the total pizza consumption for the first month**

* Days in a month: 30
* Total pizzas in month 1: 45 pizzas/day * 30 days = 1350 pizzas

**Step 5: Calculate the reduced pizza consumption for the first half of month 2**

* Reduction in month 2: 60% of 45 pizzas = 0.60 * 45 = 27 pizzas
* Reduced consumption in first half of month 2: 45 pizzas - 27 pizzas = 18 pizzas

**Step 6: Calculate the reduced pizza consumption for the second half of month 2**

* Reduction in second half of month 2: 50% of 18 pizzas = 0.50 * 18 = 9 pizzas
* Reduced consumption in second half of month 2: 18 pizzas - 9 pizzas = 9 pizzas

**Step 7: Calculate the total pizza consumption for month 2**

* Total pizzas in first half of month 2: 18 pizzas/day * 15 days = 270 pizzas
* Total pizzas in second half of month 2: 9 pizzas/day * 15 days = 135 pizzas
* Total pizzas in month 2: 270 pizzas + 135 pizzas = 405 pizzas

**Step 8: Calculate the total pizza consumption for two months**

* Total pizzas: 1350 pizzas (month 1) + 405 pizzas (month 2) = 1755 pizzas

* Total daily consumption: 10 + 20 = 30 pizzas
* Grandchild eats 2/4 * 30 = 15 pizzas/day

**Step 2: Calculate the total daily pizza consumption**

* Total daily consumption: 10 + 20 + 15 = 45 pizzas

**Step 3: Calculate the total pizza consumption for one month (30 days)**

* Total monthly consumption: 45 pizzas/day * 30 days = 1350 pizzas

**Step 4: Calculate the reduced pizza consumption for the first half of the second month**

* Reduction in the first half: 60% of 45 pizzas = 27 pizzas
* Pizza consumption in the first half: 45 - 27 = 18 pizzas/day
* Total pizza consumption in the first half: 18 pizzas/day * 15 days = 270 pizzas

**Step 5: Calculate the reduced pizza consumption for the second half of the second month**

* Reduction in the second half: 50% of 18 pizzas = 9 pizzas
* Pizza consumption in the second half: 18 - 9 = 9 pizzas/day
* Total pizza consumption in the second half: 9 pizzas/day * 15 days = 135 pizzas

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 50% for the second half. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?",1755.0,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total daily pizza consumption**

* Uncle: 10 pizzas
* Spouse: 20 pizzas
* Total: 10 + 20 = 30 pizzas

**Step 2: Calculate the grandchild's daily pizza consumption**

* Grandchild eats 2/4 (or 0.5) of the combined parents' consumption: 0.5 * 30 = 15 pizzas

**Step 3: Calculate the total daily pizza consumption for the family**

* Total daily consumption: 10 + 20 + 15 = 45 pizzas

**Step 4: Calculate the total pizza consumption for the first month**

* Days in a month: 30
* Total pizzas in month 1: 45 pizzas/day * 30 days = 1350 pizzas

**Step 5: Calculate the reduced pizza consumption for the first half of month 2**

* Reduction in month 2: 60% of 45 pizzas = 0.60 * 45 = 27 pizzas
* Reduced consumption in first half of month 2: 45 pizzas - 27 pizzas = 18 pizzas

**Step 6: Calculate the reduced pizza consumption for the second half of month 2**

* Reduction in second half of month 2: 50% of 18 pizzas = 0.50 * 18 = 9 pizzas
* Reduced consumption in second half of month 2: 18 pizzas - 9 pizzas = 9 pizzas

**Step 7: Calculate the total pizza consumption for month 2**

* Total pizzas in first half of month 2: 18 pizzas/day * 15 days = 270 pizzas
* Total pizzas in second half of month 2: 9 pizzas/day * 15 days = 135 pizzas
* Total pizzas in month 2: 270 pizzas + 135 pizzas = 405 pizzas

**Step 8: Calculate the total pizza consumption for two months**

**Error Keywords:**

- Multi-step calculation
- Percentages
- Fractions

## Corrected Solution:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of emails that don't require a response.**

* 30 emails * 20% = 6 emails

**Step 2: Calculate the number of emails that require a response.**

* 30 emails - 6 emails = 24 emails

**Step 3: Calculate half the number of emails that require a response.**

* 24 emails / 2 = 12 emails

**Step 4: Calculate the number of emails Mohammed can respond to each day.**

* 12 emails - 2 emails = 10 emails

**Step 5: Calculate the number of emails Mohammed responds to in a regular 5-day week.**

* 10 emails/day * 5 days = 50 emails

**Step 6: Calculate the number of extra emails Mohammed responds to on the overtime day.**

* 10 emails * 10% = 1 email

**Step 7: Calculate the total number of emails Mohammed responds to on the overtime day.**

* 10 emails + 1 email = 11 emails

**Step 8: Calculate the total number of emails Mohammed responds to in the 6-day work week.**

My previous answer of 24.0 minutes was incorrect because I failed to consider the change in Ananya's speed due to her injury and the different walking speeds on the beach and sidewalk. I also didn't account for the time spent on each portion of the trail. 

**Error Keywords:**

- **Misinterpretation:** I didn't fully understand the problem's details regarding speed changes and time allocation.
- **Calculation Error:** I didn't apply the correct formulas to calculate the time spent on each section of the trail.
- **Oversimplification:** I treated the problem as a simple distance/time calculation without considering the complexities of varying speeds.

## Corrected Solution:

**1. Calculate beach walking speed:**

* Let 'x' be Ananya's original speed on the beach.
* Her speed after the injury is x/2.

**2. Calculate sidewalk walking speed:**

* Her original sidewalk speed is 2x.
* Her speed after the injury is (2x)/2 = x.

**3. Calculate time spent on the beach:**

* Time = Distance / Speed
* Time on beach = 10 miles / (x/2) = 20/x hours

**4. Convert beach walking time to minutes:**

* 20/x hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1200/x minutes

**5. Calculate time spent on the sidewalk:**

* Time on sidewalk = 14 miles / x = 14/x hours

**6. Convert sidewalk walking time to minutes:**

* 14/x hours * 60 minutes/hour = 840/x minutes

**7. Calculate total walking time:**

* Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
* Total time = 1200/x + 840/x = 2040/x minutes

**8.  We know 50 minutes are spent on the beach, so:**

* 50 minutes = 1200/x minutes
* Solving for x: x = 24 miles/hour

**9. Substitute the value of x back into the total time equation:**

* Total time = 2040/24 = 85 minutes

Reflection 1: 83.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection: 

I incorrectly answered the question because I struggled to keep track of all the individual cookie counts and the relationships between the characters' findings. I likely made calculation errors along the way, and I didn't systematically work through the problem step-by-step. 

**Error Keywords:** 

* Multi-step calculation
* Variable tracking 
* Relationship identification 
* Word problem comprehension 

## Solution: 

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Start with the initial amount:** Amelia began with 11 dozen cookies, which is 11 * 12 = 132 cookies.

2. **Subtract Amelia's cookies:** After eating 5, Amelia had 132 - 5 = 127 cookies.

3. **Elena's cookies:** Elena found 5 cookies.

4. **Mei's cookies:** Mei found twice as many as Elena, so she found 5 * 2 = 10 cookies.

5. **Xavier's cookies:** Xavier found 2 less than Mei, so he found 10 - 2 = 8 cookies.

6. **Mohammed's cookies:** Mohammed found 1/8 as many as Xavier, so he found 8 / 8 = 1 cookie.

7. **Umar's cookies:** Umar found 2 dozen more than Elena and Mei combined, so he found (5 + 10) * 12 = 180 cookies.

8. **Total cookies found:** All together, they found 5 + 10 + 8 + 1 + 180 = 204 cookies.

9. **Cookies hidden:** Since Amelia hid the cookies, there are 127 - 204 = **-77 cookies** hidden. 



## Instructions: 

1. **Identify the starting amount:** Determine the initial quantity of cookies. 
2. **Break down actions:**  Separate each action (eating, finding) into individual steps. 
3. **Calculate changes:**  Calculate the effect of each action on the cookie count. 
4. **Track variables:** Keep track of the cookie count for each character separately. 
5. **Combine findings:** Add up the cookies found by all characters. 
6. **Calculate the difference:** Subtract the total found cookies from the initial amount to determine the remaining cookies. 

## Advice: 

* **Visual aids:** Use diagrams or drawings to represent the cookies and actions. 
* **Clear labeling:** Label variables clearly to avoid confusion. 
* **Check units:** Ensure consistent units throughout the calculation. 
* **Double-check:** Carefully review each step and calculation for accuracy. 
* **Practice:** Solve similar problems repeatedly to improve understanding and accuracy.

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies Amelia started with:** 11 dozen cookies * 12 cookies/dozen = 132 cookies

2. **Subtract the cookies Amelia ate:** 132 cookies - 5 cookies = 127 cookies

3. **Calculate the number of cookies Mei found:** Elena found 5 cookies, and Mei found twice that amount, so Mei found 5 cookies * 2 = 10 cookies.

4. **Calculate the number of cookies Xavier found:** Mei found 10 cookies, and Xavier found 2 less than that, so Xavier found 10 cookies - 2 cookies = 8 cookies.

5. **Calculate the number of cookies Mohammed found:** Xavier found 8 cookies, and Mohammed found an eighth of that amount, so Mohammed found 8 cookies / 8 = 1 cookie.

6. **Calculate the total number of cookies Elena, Mei, and Xavier found:** 5 cookies + 10 cookies + 8 cookies = 23 cookies

7. **Calculate the total number of cookies Umar found:** Elena and Mei found a combined total of 5 cookies + 10 cookies = 15 cookies. Umar found two dozen cookies more than that, so he found 15 cookies * 12 cookies/dozen = 180 cookies.

8. **Calculate the total number of cookies found:** 23 cookies + 1 cookie + 180 cookies = 204 cookies
