p1,gsm-symbolic,o3-mini-2025-01-31,"Beatriz went to the patisserie and bought various types of baked goods. She bought 6 dozen croissants which cost $19 per dozen, 4 dozen macarons which cost $77 per dozen, and 3 dozen brownies for $118 per dozen. How much was the total cost if she received 25% discount on all purchases?",582.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of each type of baked good.
• Croissants: 6 dozen at $19 per dozen gives 6 × $19 = $114.
• Macarons: 4 dozen at $77 per dozen gives 4 × $77 = $308.
• Brownies: 3 dozen at $118 per dozen gives 3 × $118 = $354.

Step 2: Find the total cost before the discount.
Total cost = $114 + $308 + $354 = $776.

Step 3: Apply the 25% discount on the total purchase.
A 25% discount means she pays 75% of the price.
Discounted total = 75% of $776 = 0.75 × $776 = $582.

The answer is $582.",582.0,1

But as I pour it, I spill 7 liters of the mango drink. To make up for that, I add 7 liters of water to the mix. What percentage of the final mix is water?",50.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. For the mango drink:  
 • You start with 16 liters, and it is one-ninth water.  
 • Water in the mango drink = (1/9) × 16 = 16/9 liters.  
 • Non-water in the mango drink = 16 − 16/9 = (144/9 − 16/9) = 128/9 liters.

2. When you spill 7 liters of mango drink, the entire mixture is spilled uniformly, so the water and non-water portions are removed in the same ratio.  
 • Water spilled = 7 × (1/9) = 7/9 liters.  
 • Non-water spilled = 7 × (8/9) = 56/9 liters.

3. In the remaining mango drink (16 − 7 = 9 liters):  
 • Water left = 16/9 − 7/9 = 9/9 = 1 liter.  
 • Non-water left = 128/9 − 56/9 = 72/9 = 8 liters.

4. For the apple drink:  
 • You have 14 liters of apple drink that is half water.  
 • Water in apple drink = 14 × 1/2 = 7 liters.  
 • Non-water in apple drink = 14 − 7 = 7 liters.

5. Mix the remaining mango drink with the apple drink:  
 • Total volume = 9 liters (mango) + 14 liters (apple) = 23 liters.  
 • Total water = 1 liter (from mango) + 7 liters (from apple) = 8 liters.  
 • Total non-water = 8 liters (from mango) + 7 liters (from apple) = 15 liters.

6. Then, you add 7 liters of water to the mix:  
 • New total volume = 23 + 7 = 30 liters.  
 • New total water = 8 + 7 = 15 liters.  
 • Total non-water remains = 15 liters.

7. Finally, to find the percentage of water in the final mix:  
 • Water fraction = 15/30 = 1/2 = 0.5.  
 • Converting to a percentage: 0.5 × 100 = 50%.

If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 10 hours if she spends 2/5 of the time running, 1/2 of the time skipping, and the remaining of the time walking?",27.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Let w be Mei's walking speed in miles per hour.
2. According to the problem, her running speed is 4 times her walking speed, so it is 4w.
3. Her skipping speed is ½ the running speed, which gives (1/2) × 4w = 2w.
4. We are given that her skipping speed is 2 miles per hour, so:
   2w = 2, which means w = 1 mph.
5. Therefore, Mei's speeds are:
   - Walking speed = 1 mph
   - Running speed = 4 mph
   - Skipping speed = 2 mph
6. Mei spends 10 hours in total. She spends:
   - Running for (2/5) of the time: (2/5) × 10 = 4 hours.
   - Skipping for (1/2) of the time: (1/2) × 10 = 5 hours.
   - The remaining time walking: 10 - 4 - 5 = 1 hour.
7. Now, compute the distance for each activity:
   - Distance while running: 4 mph × 4 hours = 16 miles.
   - Distance while skipping: 2 mph × 5 hours = 10 miles.
   - Distance while walking: 1 mph × 1 hour = 1 mile.
8. Total distance traveled = 16 + 10 + 1 = 27 miles.

If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?",180.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, find your remaining calorie allowance. Your daily target is 2300 calories, and you have already consumed 1200 calories. This leaves you with 2300 – 1200 = 1100 calories. Because you exercised and burned 100 calories, you effectively have an extra 100 calories available, making your remaining allowance 1100 + 100 = 1200 calories.

2. Next, determine how many servings of cookies you can eat with 1200 calories. The nutritional info tells us that each serving has 200 calories. Therefore, the number of servings you can have is 1200 ÷ 200 = 6 servings.

3. Now, find the weight in ounces of one serving. The bag weighs 150 oz and contains 5 servings, so one serving weighs 150 oz ÷ 5 = 30 oz.

4. Finally, calculate the total ounces of cookies you can eat. Since you can have 6 servings and each serving is 30 oz, you can eat 6 × 30 = 180 oz of cookies.

1. Convert all TV time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, and Noah watched a total of 24 hours, so:  
  Total minutes = 24 × 60 = 1440 minutes.

2. Calculate the TV time for each day except Monday:
 • Saturday: one 4-hour episode = 4 × 60 = 240 minutes.

Fatima's recipe uses:
• Teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio 63:14.  
• Tablespoons of milk to cups of water in the ratio 9:7.

Step 1: Express sugar and water in terms of k.  
Let sugar = 63k and water = 14k.

Step 2: Express milk in terms of the same k.  
Since the ratio of milk to water is 9:7, if water = 14k then we set:  
  7n = 14k  →  n = 2k.  
Thus, milk = 9n = 9(2k) = 18k.

Step 3: Total amount used is the sum of sugar, water, and milk.  
Total = sugar + water + milk = 63k + 14k + 18k = 95k.

Step 4: Set up the equation with the given total of 760.

He also bought 3 crayons which cost ₣11 each. How much did Arjun spend on everything if he receives 10% discount on all purchases?",117.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, we calculate the cost of the notebooks:
   - Arjun bought 12 notebooks at ₣2.75 each.
   - So, the cost for the notebooks is 12 × 2.75 = ₣33.

2. Next, we calculate the cost of the rulers:
   - He bought 6 rulers at ₣9.0 each.
   - So, the cost for the rulers is 6 × 9.0 = ₣54.

3. Then, we add the cost of the bond paper:

1. First, find the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 on a 20-sided die.  
   - The numbers greater than 10 are 11, 12, ..., 20, so there are 10 possible outcomes.  
   - The probability is 10/20 = 0.5.

2. Next, find the probability of rolling an odd number on one roll of the 20-sided die.  
   - There are 10 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ..., 19) out of 20, so the probability is also 10/20 = 0.5.

3. Now, determine the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row.  
   - Since the rolls are independent, multiply the single-roll probability four times:  
     0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.0625.

4. To compare the two probabilities, divide the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 by the probability of rolling four odd numbers:  
   - 0.5 / 0.0625 = 8.  
   This means that rolling a number greater than 10 is 8 times as likely as rolling four odd numbers in a row.

5. To express how much more likely this is as a percentage, calculate the percentage increase from the four-odd probability:  
   - The extra likelihood is 8 times as likely, which is a 700% increase over the original probability (since 8 times as likely means there is 7 times more chance, or 700% more):

1. Initially, Yuki was a pen pal with 8 people. He stopped being pen pals with 4 of them, so he remains in touch with 8 - 4 = 4 pen pals.

2. Each of these 4 pen pals sends 3 letters a week, with each letter being 10 pages long. Thus, from one pen pal, Yuki receives 3 × 10 = 30 pages per week.

3. Since he responds in kind, Yuki writes back with 30 pages per pen pal per week. For 4 pen pals, he writes a total of 4 × 30 = 120 pages each week.

4. Yuki can write 1 page in 14 minutes. So, the total writing time per week is 120 pages × 14 minutes per page = 1680 minutes.

Prof. Johnson sold his apartment for $540000.
He paid registration fees of 3% of the selling price, which is 0.03 × $540000 = $16200.
He also paid an agent fee of 6% of the selling price, which is 0.06 × $540000 = $32400.
Additionally, he paid $260000 for the remaining loan amount and $5000 for closing costs.

1. Mateo works 6 hours per day and works 3 days a week. That means he works a total of 6 × 3 = 18 hours each week.

2. For each hour, he earns ₣25. So his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are 18 × ₣25 = ₣450.

3. Since the company performed well, he gets a ₣205 bonus each week. Adding the bonus, his total weekly income becomes ₣450 + ₣205 = ₣655.

4. In September, we assume he works for 4 weeks. So his total income before tax for the month is 4 × ₣655 = ₣2620.

5. Mateo has to pay 35% in income tax on his earnings. This means he keeps 65% (100% - 35%) of his income. Thus, his income after tax is ₣2620 × 0.65 = ₣1703.

The roller coaster costs €10 per ride. For the transportation of the birthday party guests, Emma needs to rent a bus for the day, which costs €60. How many friends can she invite?",2.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Emma's budget for the party is €180.
2. For transportation, she needs to rent a bus which costs €60.
3. Subtracting the bus cost from the total budget leaves:
   €180 - €60 = €120 for all the activities.
4. Each person (Emma and each friend) gets:
   - One round of laser tag for €6,
   - €4 in pinball tokens,
   - Three rides on the roller coaster at €10 per ride (3 × €10 = €30).
5. So, the total activity cost per person is:
   €6 + €4 + €30 = €40.
6. Let n be the number of friends Emma can invite. Since Emma is included as one participant, the total number of participants is n + 1.
7. The total cost for the activities is then:
   (n + 1) × €40.
8. This cost must be within the remaining budget of €120:
   (n + 1) × €40 ≤ €120.
9. Dividing both sides by €40 gives:

Let the width of the office be x feet.
Then the length of the office is x + 16 feet.
We know that the area of the rectangular office is given by:
  Area = width × length = x × (x + 16) = 225.
This gives us the equation:
  x² + 16x - 225 = 0.
Using the quadratic formula x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a) with a = 1, b = 16, and c = -225:
  x = ( -16 ± √(16² - 4 × 1 × (-225)) ) / 2
  x = ( -16 ± √(256 + 900) ) / 2
  x = ( -16 ± √1156 ) / 2
Since √1156 = 34, we have:
  x = (-16 ± 34) / 2.
We discard the negative value because dimensions must be positive:

1. Deshawn starts with 615 crackers.
2. Each bowl can hold 21 crackers and he has 11 bowls. So, the total capacity of the bowls is 11 × 21 = 231 crackers.
3. Each plate holds two times that of a bowl, which is 2 × 21 = 42 crackers, and he has 4 plates. So, the total capacity of the plates is 4 × 42 = 168 crackers.
4. Combining both, the total capacity available is 231 + 168 = 399 crackers.
5. Next, Deshawn eats a third of his crackers. That means he eats 615 ÷ 3 = 205 crackers.

1. The normal price of flour is ₣10 per kilogram. Since Santiago had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 40% more, the price per kilogram for this brand is:
   ₣10 + 40% of ₣10 = ₣10 + ₣4 = ₣14 per kilogram.

2. Santiago uses 3 kilograms of flour per day and buys enough for a week (7 days), so the total amount of flour he buys is:
   3 kg/day × 7 days = 21 kilograms.

1. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
2. The bin of stuffed animals has 6 stuffed animals.
3. The action figure pack has twice the number of blocks and stuffed animals combined:
  a. First, add the blocks and stuffed animals: 31 + 6 = 37.

1. Each goat needs 9 kilograms. With 21 goats, the total grain for goats is 21 × 9 = 189 kilograms.

2. Each alpaca needs 3 kilograms less than twice the amount a goat needs. Twice the goat's amount is 2 × 9 = 18 kilograms, and subtracting 3 gives 18 − 3 = 15 kilograms per alpaca. With 7 alpacas, the total grain for alpacas is 7 × 15 = 105 kilograms.

3. Each cow eats as much as a goat and an alpaca combined. That is 9 + 15 = 24 kilograms per cow. With 21 cows, the total grain for cows is 21 × 24 = 504 kilograms.

Due to the flu season, 35 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.",50.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The hospital has 800 beds in total.
2. Out of these, one-fifth are out of service. So, the number of out-of-service beds is (1/5) × 800 = 160.
3. Therefore, the number of beds that can be used (functional beds) is 800 − 160 = 640.
4. It is given that 1/8 of all beds are occupied. This means 1/8 × 800 = 100 beds are occupied initially.
5. So, the number of unoccupied functional beds at the start is 640 − 100 = 540.
6. Due to the flu season, 35 patients are admitted each day. Over 2 weeks (which is 14 days), the total number of new patients admitted is 35 × 14 = 490.
7. These 490 patients will occupy 490 of the 540 unoccupied functional beds.

On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday and 28 boxes of orange pie. On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the cupcake cost ₺10 and the orange pie cost ₺22, how much was Andre's average daily earning?",980.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

● On Monday:
 ○ Cupcakes sold = 24 boxes.
 ○ Orange pies sold: The statement says he sold 16 fewer boxes than on Tuesday. Since on Tuesday he sold 28 boxes of orange pie, on Monday he sold 28 – 16 = 12 boxes.
 ○ Monday’s earnings = (Cupcakes: 24 × ₺10) + (Orange pies: 12 × ₺22) = ₺240 + ₺264 = ₺504.

● On Tuesday:
 ○ Cupcakes sold = 11 more than Monday’s 24 boxes, so 24 + 11 = 35 boxes.
 ○ Orange pies sold = 28 boxes (given).
 ○ Tuesday’s earnings = (Cupcakes: 35 × ₺10) + (Orange pies: 28 × ₺22) = ₺350 + ₺616 = ₺966.

● On Wednesday:
 ○ The problem states he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. This can be interpreted as selling for each product the total of Monday and Tuesday.
  – Cupcakes on Wednesday = Monday’s 24 + Tuesday’s 35 = 59 boxes.
  – Orange pies on Wednesday = Monday’s 12 + Tuesday’s 28 = 40 boxes.
 ○ Wednesday’s earnings = (Cupcakes: 59 × ₺10) + (Orange pies: 40 × ₺22) = ₺590 + ₺880 = ₺1,470.

Half of the volleyball players are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the competition?",62.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, we find how many students are volleyball players.  
 • Dr. Lee’s class has 125 students.  
 • 24% of 125 are volleyball players: 0.24 × 125 = 30 volleyball players.

2. Next, we determine the number of students who are not volleyball players.  
 • Remaining students = 125 − 30 = 95.

3. The problem tells us that out of these remaining 95, 40% are robotics club members or choir members.  
 • 40% of 95 = 0.40 × 95 = 38 students.  
 • Although the wording uses “or,” later the problem refers to “these 3 groups,” implying that the robotics club and choir form two separate groups. It is therefore natural to assume that the 38 students are split equally between the robotics club and the choir.  
  – Robotics club members = 38 ÷ 2 = 19.  
  – Choir members = 38 ÷ 2 = 19.

4. However, not all volleyball players will be leaving early because half of them are absent due to sickness.  
 • Present volleyball players = 30 ÷ 2 = 15.

5. Now we have three groups that need to leave early:  
 • Volleyball players: 15  
 • Robotics club members: 19  
 • Choir members: 19

6. The problem also states that 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups.  
 • Since there are 3 groups, the total number of cheerleaders = 3 × 3 = 9.

7. Finally, add up the students in the groups and the cheerleaders:  
 • Total leaving early = 15 (volleyball) + 19 (robotics) + 19 (choir) + 9 (cheerleaders)  
 • Total = 15 + 19 + 19 + 9 = 62.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of classes Santiago attends in a day.  
• A normal student has 6 periods.  
• Santiago takes 3 extra classes.  
• Total classes per day = 6 + 3 = 9 classes.

Step 2: Determine the time spent per class.  
• Each class is 30 minutes long.  
• He spends an extra 15 minutes before each class for review and preparation.  
• Total time per class = 30 + 15 = 45 minutes.

Step 3: Calculate the total class time for one day.  
• He attends 9 classes, each taking 45 minutes.  
• Daily class time = 9 × 45 = 405 minutes.

Step 4: Find the total class time in a week.  
• Santiago goes to class for 4 days a week.  
• Weekly class time = 405 minutes/day × 4 days = 1620 minutes.

p1,gsm-symbolic,o3-mini-2025-01-31,"Olivia walks 20 kilometers every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 kilometers of walking on the beach and 10 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?",75.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Let the original walking speed on the beach be r (in km/h). Then, since Olivia normally walks four times as fast on the sidewalk, her original sidewalk speed is 4r.

2. Due to her injury, her speed decreases by half on both sections.
   • New beach speed = r/2.
   • New sidewalk speed = (4r)/2 = 2r.

3. The beach portion is 10 kilometers long. The time taken on the beach, using the adjusted speed, is computed by:
   Time on the beach = Distance / Speed = 10 ÷ (r/2) = 20/r hours.
   We are given that Olivia spends 60 minutes, or 1 hour, on the beach. So:
   20/r = 1
   Solving for r gives: r = 20 km/h.

4. Now, calculate her new sidewalk speed:
   New sidewalk speed = 2r = 2 × 20 = 40 km/h.

5. The sidewalk portion is also 10 kilometers long. The time taken on the sidewalk is:
   Time on the sidewalk = 10 ÷ 40 = 0.25 hours = 15 minutes.

6. Therefore, the total time for the entire 20-kilometer walk is:
   Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk = 60 minutes + 15 minutes = 75 minutes.

Arjun eats 3 pancakes a day for 57 days.  
• The total pancakes eaten during these 57 days is 57 × 3 = 171 pancakes.

There are 10 weeks in total, which is 10 × 7 = 70 days.  
• After the first 57 days, the remaining days are 70 - 57 = 13 days.

For the remaining 13 days, Arjun eats 9 pancakes a day.  
• The total pancakes eaten during these 13 days is 13 × 9 = 117 pancakes.

Now, add the pancakes from both periods:  
• Total pancakes = 171 + 117 = 288 pancakes.

Since 1 dozen equals 12 pancakes, we convert the total pancakes to dozens:  
• Dozens of pancakes = 288 / 12 = 24 dozens.

Noah finds half as many as Winnie, and Oscar finds four dozen eggs more than Tara and James combined. How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?",12.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Esteban hid 11 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the total number of eggs is 11 × 12 = 132 eggs.

2. James finds 4 eggs.

3. Tara finds five times as many eggs as James. So, Tara finds 5 × 4 = 20 eggs.

4. Winnie finds 4 less than Tara. That means Winnie finds 20 − 4 = 16 eggs.

5. Noah finds half as many eggs as Winnie. Therefore, Noah finds 16 ÷ 2 = 8 eggs.

6. Oscar finds four dozen eggs more than Tara and James combined. First, Tara and James together find 20 + 4 = 24 eggs. Four dozen is 4 × 12 = 48 eggs, so Oscar finds 24 + 48 = 72 eggs.

7. Now, add up all the eggs found: James (4) + Tara (20) + Winnie (16) + Noah (8) + Oscar (72) = 4 + 20 + 16 + 8 + 72 = 120 eggs.

Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each place and he gets paid ¥0.45 per collection for each apartment. He also earns 14% on tips. How much money does he make in a week?,1539.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Determine the number of apartments in each complex:  
 • The first complex has 300 apartments.  
 • The second complex also has 300 apartments.  
 • The last complex is 50% bigger than the total of the first two. The first two together have 300 + 300 = 600 apartments. Increasing 600 by 50% means an addition of 0.50 × 600 = 300 apartments, so the last complex has 600 + 300 = 900 apartments.

2. Find the total number of apartments:  
 300 + 300 + 900 = 1500 apartments.

3. Calculate the number of collections per week:  
 Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, he makes 1500 × 2 = 3000 collections per week.

4. Calculate the earnings from collections:  
 He earns ¥0.45 per collection, so his base earnings are 3000 × ¥0.45 = ¥1350.

5. Add the earnings from tips:  
 He earns an additional 14% on tip earnings. This is 14% of his base earnings, so:  
 14% of ¥1350 = 0.14 × ¥1350 = ¥189.

Gabriel starts with 78 beads.

He trips and drops one‑third of the beads. One‑third of 78 is 78 ÷ 3 = 26 beads.
So, before searching, 26 beads fall out of his bag. The beads still in his bag are 78 − 26 = 52 beads.

Gabriel searches for the dropped beads and recovers 17 of them.
Now, combining the beads still in his bag (52) with the beads found (17), he has 52 + 17 = 69 beads.
