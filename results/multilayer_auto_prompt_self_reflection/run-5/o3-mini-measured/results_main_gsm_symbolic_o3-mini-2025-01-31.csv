1. Start with the peach drink:
 • The peach drink has 20 liters, and 1/5 of it is water.
 • So, the amount of water in the peach drink is 20 × 1/5 = 4 liters.
 • This means there are 20 - 4 = 16 liters of nonwater in the peach drink.

2. Spilling the peach drink:
 • You spill 5 liters of the peach drink.
 • Since the water and nonwater parts are evenly mixed, 5/20 (which is 1/4) of the drink is spilled.
 • The amount of water spilled is 4 × 1/4 = 1 liter.
 • The amount of nonwater spilled is 16 × 1/4 = 4 liters.
 • Thus, the remaining peach drink is 20 - 5 = 15 liters, with water now being 4 - 1 = 3 liters and nonwater 16 - 4 = 12 liters.

3. Now consider the lemon drink:
 • The lemon drink is 16 liters and 1/4 of it is water.
 • So, the amount of water in the lemon drink is 16 × 1/4 = 4 liters.
 • This means there are 16 - 4 = 12 liters of nonwater in the lemon drink.

4. Combining the remaining drinks:
 • Total volume after combining = 15 liters (peach drink) + 16 liters (lemon drink) = 31 liters.
 • Total water = 3 liters (from peach) + 4 liters (from lemon) = 7 liters.

The answer is 7 liters of water in the remaining 31 liters.",31.0,0

If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 6 hours if she spends 2/4 of the time running and three-sixths of the time walking?",36.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Jasmine can run five times faster than she can walk. Let's denote her walking speed as W and her running speed as R. So, R = 5W.

2. It is given that she can skip at 3/5 of her running speed. Let her skipping speed be S, so S = (3/5)R.

3. We know that she can skip at 6 miles per hour. That means:
  (3/5)R = 6 mph  
  R = (6 × 5) / 3 = 10 mph.

4. Using R = 5W, we find her walking speed:
  W = R / 5 = 10 / 5 = 2 mph.

5. The problem states that during a 6‑hour period, she spends 2/4 of the time running and 3/6 of the time walking:
  2/4 = 1/2 of the time running  
  3/6 = 1/2 of the time walking  
Since 1/2 of 6 hours is 3 hours, she runs for 3 hours and walks for 3 hours.

6. Calculate the distance covered while running:
  Distance running = running speed × running time = 10 mph × 3 hours = 30 miles.

7. Calculate the distance covered while walking:
  Distance walking = walking speed × walking time = 2 mph × 3 hours = 6 miles.

If a 300 ounces bag has 5 servings, how many ounces can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2360 and you have already consumed 1700 calories?",144.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The bag of bread weighs 300 ounces and contains 5 servings. This means each serving weighs 300 / 5 = 60 ounces.

2. Each serving has 275 calories. So, the calories per ounce are 275 / 60 ≈ 4.5833 calories per ounce.

3. The daily calorie target is 2360 calories, and you have already consumed 1700 calories. This leaves 2360 - 1700 = 660 calories remaining.

4. To find out how many ounces you can eat with the remaining 660 calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per ounce:
  Ounces = 660 / (275/60) = 660 * (60/275).

1. First, we find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6, so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 (or 50%).

2. Next, we determine the probability of rolling an even number on one roll. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, the probability for one roll is 3/6 = 1/2.

3. For rolling two even numbers in a row, since the rolls are independent, we multiply the probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 (or 25%).

4. Now, to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we compare the probabilities. We have a 50% chance for a number greater than 3 and a 25% chance for two even numbers in a row.

5. The ratio of these probabilities is (50% divided by 25%) = 2. This means rolling a number greater than 3 is twice as likely as rolling two even numbers in a row. Expressed as a percentage increase, it is 100% more likely.

1. Initially, there are 64 artists and 51 engineers. That gives a total of 64 + 51 = 115 people.
2. We are told that after half an hour one‐fifth of the total number of people left. One‐fifth of 115 is 115 ÷ 5 = 23. This means 23 people left and 115 – 23 = 92 people remained.

She also bought a mixed bag of sand dollars for ¥11.5 and 17 postcards that were ¥20.5 each. How much money does Sofia have left?",427.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Fudge cost:
 a. The sale says: “Buy 16 kgs at ¥21 per kg, get 5 kgs 2/3 off.” This means if Sofia buys at least 16 kgs, she can get 5 additional kgs at 2/3 off. A “2/3 off” discount means you pay only 1/3 of the original price for those 5 kgs.
 b. Full price for 1 kg of fudge is ¥21.
 c. For 16 kgs at full price: 16 × 21 = ¥336.
 d. For 5 kgs at 2/3 off, the price per kg becomes 21 × (1/3) = ¥7. So, 5 × 7 = ¥35.
 e. Together, if she bought 21 kgs (16 + 5), the cost would be ¥336 + ¥35 = ¥371.
 f. However, Sofia scooped up 23 kgs. The offer applies to only 21 kgs, so the extra 2 kgs are charged at the regular price:
  – Extra cost: 2 × 21 = ¥42.
 g. Total cost for 23 kgs of fudge = ¥336 + ¥35 + ¥42 = ¥413.

 a. Mixed bag of sand dollars: ¥11.5.
 b. 17 postcards at ¥20.5 each: 17 × 20.5 = ¥348.5.

1. Liam uses the vending machines where a bag of popcorn costs 25 cents and a pretzel costs 100 cents.
2. He gets 4 bags of popcorn. Their total cost is 4 × 25 = 100 cents.
3. We are told that he “spent ₣1000” and that he had 8% of his money left in change. This tells us that the 1000 cents represent 92% of his total money (because 100% – 8% = 92%).
4. However, to determine how many pretzels he bought, we do not need the initial total amount. We only need to account for his spending:  
   The money spent on items (popcorn and pretzels) is 1000 cents.
5. Let the number of pretzels he bought be x. The total cost of the items is then:
  Cost of popcorn + Cost of pretzels = 100 + (100 × x)
6. Since his total spending equals 1000 cents, we set up the equation:
  100 + 100x = 1000

The infection starts with 6 people.
Every day, each infected person infects 2 others.
On day 1, the 6 initial people infect 6 × 2 = 12 new people.

1. On Friday, Oscar sold 29 boxes of brownies.  
2. On Saturday, he sold 11 more boxes of brownies than on Friday, so he sold 29 + 11 = 40 boxes of brownies on Saturday.  
3. On Saturday, Oscar sold 26 boxes of kiwi pie.  
4. On Friday, he sold 12 fewer boxes of kiwi pie than he did on Saturday. So, on Friday he sold 26 - 12 = 14 boxes of kiwi pie.

1. Each plant takes up 3 feet of space, and in between every two plants, Kimia must leave a gap of 15 feet.
2. If Kimia plants n plants in a row, the total space occupied will be:
  Total length = (n × 3 feet) + [(n – 1) × 15 feet]
3. This total length must not exceed the 180‑foot-long flower bed. So we have:

The second biggest waterslide is 200 meters long, but steeper, so people slide down at 100 meters/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?",3.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.
The biggest waterslide is 400 meters long, and people slide down at 80 meters per minute.
So, the time taken for the biggest slide is 400 ÷ 80 = 5 minutes.
The second biggest waterslide is 200 meters long, and people slide down at 100 meters per minute.
So, the time taken for the second biggest slide is 200 ÷ 100 = 2 minutes.
The difference in ride times is 5 minutes - 2 minutes = 3 minutes.

On the sidewalk, Emma walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 27-mile walk, in minutes?",90.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Emma walks 11 miles on the beach. Let her speed on the beach be v miles per minute.
2. The time spent walking on the beach is given by distance/speed, so it is 11/v minutes.
3. We are told that this beach-walking time is 66 minutes. This gives us the equation: 11/v = 66.
4. Solving for v, we get v = 11/66 = 1/6 miles per minute.
5. On the sidewalk, Emma walks at four times her beach speed, so her sidewalk speed is 4v = 4/6 = 2/3 miles per minute.
6. The sidewalk distance is 16 miles. The time to cover this distance is given by 16 ÷ (2/3) = 16 * (3/2) = 24 minutes.
7. The total time for the entire walk is the sum of the beach time and the sidewalk time, which is 66 + 24 = 90 minutes.

Winnie eats 4 eggs a day for 60 days.
So, in this period she consumes 4 × 60 = 240 eggs.
Then, Winnie increases her consumption to 5 eggs a day for 96 days.
So, during these days she eats 5 × 96 = 480 eggs.
Adding both periods, the total number of eggs is 240 + 480 = 720 eggs.
Since one dozen is 12 eggs, the number of dozens required is 720 ÷ 12 = 60.

1. Tariq hid 9 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12, he hid 9 × 12 = 108 eggs.
2. Noah finds 5 eggs.
3. Emma finds four times as many eggs as Noah, so she finds 4 × 5 = 20 eggs.
4. Olivia finds 2 less than Emma, so she finds 20 - 2 = 18 eggs.
5. Alejandro finds half as many as Olivia, which is ½ × 18 = 9 eggs.

Ali collects garbage 3 times a week from each place and he gets paid €0.4 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?,2538.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The first 3 apartment complexes each have 300 apartments.  
   So, the total number of apartments in these complexes is 3 × 300 = 900.

2. The last apartment complex is 35% larger than the combined total of the first three complexes.  
   35% of 900 is 0.35 × 900 = 315.  
   Therefore, the last complex has 900 + 315 = 1215 apartments.

3. Now, the total number of apartments across all 4 complexes is 900 + 1215 = 2115.

4. Ali collects garbage 3 times each week at every apartment.  
   So, the number of collections per week is 2115 × 3 = 6345.

1. Ali starts with 96 marbles.
2. He dropped three-sixths of them. Since three-sixths is equivalent to one-half, he dropped 96 ÷ 2 = 48 marbles.
3. That means the 48 marbles that he did not drop remained safe.
4. While searching for the dropped ones, he only found 18 marbles.
5. So before any further adjustments, the total marbles he had were the 48 (that weren't dropped) plus the 18 he recovered, which equals 48 + 18 = 66.

As the pot of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 30 pop in the first 22 seconds of cooking, then 2 times that amount in the next 22 seconds. The kernels increase to 4 times the initial popping rate in the next 22 seconds, but in the final 22 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 22 seconds. After Oscar takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Oscar have to eat?",285.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. In the first 22 seconds, 30 pieces of popcorn pop.
2. In the next 22 seconds, 2 times the initial amount pop, so 2 × 30 = 60 pieces pop.
3. In the following 22 seconds, 4 times the initial amount pop, so 4 × 30 = 120 pieces pop.
4. In the final 22 seconds, the popping rate slows to half of the previous rate (from the third period). Since 120 pieces popped in the third period, half of that is 120 / 2 = 60 pieces.
5. After the pot is taken off the heat, an additional quarter of the pieces from the final period pop due to residual heat. That is ¼ × 60 = 15 pieces.
