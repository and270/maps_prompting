p2,gsm-symbolic,o3-mini-2025-01-31,"Sophia went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, and 60 mini cheesecakes. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Sophia bought 60 donuts priced at $19 per dozen. Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, she bought 60 / 12 = 5 dozens of donuts. So, the cost for the donuts is 5 × $19 = $95.

2. She also bought 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen. Similarly, 60 / 12 = 5 dozens, so the cost for the cupcakes is 5 × $33 = $165.

3. The third item is 60 mini cheesecakes, and let the cost per dozen be p dollars. Since she bought 60 mini cheesecakes, which is 5 dozens, the cost for the mini cheesecakes is 5 × p = 5p.

4. The total cost before the discount is therefore $95 + $165 + 5p = $260 + 5p.

5. Sophia received a 20% discount, meaning she paid 80% of the original total cost. Hence, 0.8 × (260 + 5p) = $1500.

6. Now, we can set up the equation:
  0.8(260 + 5p) = 1500

7. Divide the equation:
  0.8 × 260 = 208, so the equation becomes:
  208 + 4p = 1500

8. Subtract 208 from both sides:
  4p = 1500 - 208 = 1292

9. Solve for p by dividing both sides by 4:
  p = 1292 / 4 = 323

The cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is $323.",323.0,1
p2,gsm-symbolic,o3-mini-2025-01-31,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving. A 300 grams bag has 6 servings. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?",350.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, we find each person’s healthy daily calorie target.  
 • Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, so his target is 220 × 15 = 3300 calories.  
 • Tara weighs 140 lbs, so her target is 140 × 15 = 2100 calories.

2. Next, we calculate how many calories they have already taken in after accounting for exercise or extra food.  
 • Hiroshi has consumed 1100 calories but burned 200 calories, yielding a net of 1100 − 200 = 900 calories.  
 • Tara has consumed 900 calories from food and an additional 200 calories from ice cream, totaling 900 + 200 = 1100 calories.

3. Then, we determine how many more calories each needs to reach their target.  
 • Hiroshi needs 3300 − 900 = 2400 calories.  
 • Tara needs 2100 − 1100 = 1000 calories.

4. Now, examine the popcorn's nutritional info. The bag provides:  
 • 200 calories per serving  
 • 6 servings per 300 grams  
 So, total calories per bag = 6 × 200 = 1200 calories, and grams per bag = 300 grams.

5. We find the number of calories per gram for the popcorn:  
 Calories per gram = 1200 ÷ 300 = 4 calories per gram.

6. To get the additional grams of popcorn each needs, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per gram.  
 • Hiroshi needs 2400 calories, so he needs 2400 ÷ 4 = 600 grams.  
 • Tara needs 1000 calories, so she needs 1000 ÷ 4 = 250 grams.

7. Finally, we find how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs compared to Tara:  
 Difference = 600 grams − 250 grams = 350 grams.

If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, determine 1/4 of the city’s width. Since the city is 80 miles across, 1/4 of 80 miles is 20 miles.

2. Initially, the fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, which means its starting speed is 4 miles per hour.

3. In the first hour, the fog bank covers 4 miles. This leaves 20 - 4 = 16 miles to cover.

4. However, after one hour, the wind speed is halved. Thus, the fog bank’s speed drops to 2 miles per hour.

5. At this new speed, to cover the remaining 16 miles the time required is:
  Time = Distance / Speed = 16 miles / 2 mph = 8 hours.  
  Converting 8 hours to minutes gives 8 × 60 = 480 minutes.

1. Nia uses teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 54:27, which simplifies to 2:1. This means if she uses S teaspoons of sugar, she uses S/2 cups of water.

2. She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, which is equivalent to 1 tablespoon of milk per cup of water. Therefore, she uses S/2 tablespoons of milk (since she has S/2 cups of water).

In the span of two years, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?",1764.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. For the banana field:
   - Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field.
   - There are 36 bananas produced per 4/5 of a square yard.
   - First, find the number of bananas produced per 1 square yard:
     36 bananas ÷ (4/5) square yard = 36 × (5/4) = 45 bananas per square yard.
   - So, in one harvest, the total bananas harvested from 10 square yards is:
     10 × 45 = 450 bananas.
   
2. The bananas can be harvested every 4 months. In 2 years (which is 24 months), the number of harvests is:
   24 ÷ 4 = 6 harvests.
   - Therefore, the total number of bananas harvested in 2 years is:
     450 × 6 = 2700 bananas.
   
3. For the apricot field:
   - Ravi has a 13-square yard apricot field.

What is the least amount Arjun can spend on everything?",212.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, calculate the full price for each type of school supply before any discounts:
 • Folders: 12 folders × $4.75 each = 12 × $4.75 = $57.
 • Erasers: 8 erasers × $14.5 each = 8 × $14.5 = $116.
 • Bond paper: 1 ream = $11.
 • Pencils: 7 pencils × $8 each = 7 × $8 = $56.

2. Now, add these amounts to get the total cost before discounts:
 Total = $57 + $116 + $11 + $56 = $240.

3. Next, consider the two discount options:

 Option 1: Become a member
  • Membership fee = $20.
  • Discount = 20%, so Arjun pays 80% of the total purchase.
  • Discounted purchase amount = 0.8 × $240 = $192.
  • Total amount with membership = $192 + $20 = $212.

 Option 2: Not become a member
  • Discount = 5%, so Arjun pays 95% of the total purchase.

1. When rolling a twenty-sided die, the numbers greater than 5 are 6 through 20. There are 15 such numbers out of 20. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 in one roll is 15/20 = 0.75 (or 75%).

2. For two consecutive rolls, since the rolls are independent, the probability of getting a number greater than 5 each time is 0.75 × 0.75 = 0.5625, which is 56.25%.

3. Next, the even numbers on a twenty-sided die are 2, 4, 6, ..., 20. There are 10 even numbers out of 20, so the probability of rolling an even number in one roll is 10/20 = 0.5 (or 50%).

4. For four consecutive rolls, the probability of rolling an even number each time is 0.5^4 = 0.0625, which is 6.25%.

5. To find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 5 twice in a row than to roll four even numbers in a row, we subtract the probability for four even rolls from that for two greater-than-5 rolls:

3. So, the total number of spotted puppies for Jamal becomes 23 + 54 = 77.
4. Gabriel's dog has 47 puppies, 13 of which have spots.
5. Yuki has 54 dogs, and each dog has 13 puppies with spots. Therefore, Yuki's total spotted puppies are 54 * 13 = 702.
6. Now, let's find the overall totals:
   - Total puppies: Jamal's 131 + Gabriel's 47 + Yuki's 702 = 880 puppies.
   - Total spotted puppies: Jamal's 77 + Gabriel's 13 + Yuki's 702 = 792 spotted puppies.
7. The percentage of all puppies that have spots is (792 / 880) * 100. Simplifying:
   - 792 / 880 = 0.9, which means 0.9 * 100 = 90%.

Since apples are a rare treat, he only buys four 3-kg boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys twelve 6-kg bags. Hay are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys thirty four 39-kg packs. Corn are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 17-kg sacks. Finally, he buys 43 kgs of groceries, and 27 kgs of tools, and 100 kgs of wood. A farm truck can carry 160 kgs at a time. If the farmer has three trucks, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the purchased items?",4.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, calculate the weight for each type of item:
   • Apples: 4 boxes each weighing 3 kg → 4 × 3 = 12 kg.
   • Cucumbers: 12 bags each weighing 6 kg → 12 × 6 = 72 kg.
   • Hay: 34 packs each weighing 39 kg → 34 × 39 = 1,326 kg.
   • Corn: 20 sacks each weighing 17 kg → 20 × 17 = 340 kg.
   • Additionally, there are 43 kg of groceries, 27 kg of tools, and 100 kg of wood. Their total weight is 43 + 27 + 100 = 170 kg.

2. Now, add up all the weights:
   Total weight = 12 kg + 72 kg + 1,326 kg + 340 kg + 170 kg  
   Total weight = 1,920 kg

3. Each farm truck can carry 160 kg, and the farmer has 3 trucks. So, the total capacity per trip is:
   Capacity per trip = 3 × 160 = 480 kg

4. Determine the number of trips by dividing the total weight by the capacity per trip:
   Number of trips = 1,920 kg ÷ 480 kg/trip = 4 trips

Later, Uma saw another 10-foot shark with 6 remoras, each 8 inches long, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?",45.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

• First, consider the 40-foot shark.
  – It originally had 18 remoras, each 16 inches long.
  – Since 1/6 of the remoras swam away, the number remaining is 18 - (1/6 × 18) = 18 - 3 = 15 remoras.
  – The total remora length on this shark is 15 × 16 = 240 inches.
  – Convert the shark’s length to inches: 40 feet = 40 × 12 = 480 inches.
  – The percentage of the shark's body length covered is (240 ÷ 480) × 100 = 50%.

• Next, consider the 10-foot shark.
  – This shark had 6 remoras, each 8 inches long.
  – The total remora length is 6 × 8 = 48 inches.
  – Convert the shark’s length to inches: 10 feet = 10 × 12 = 120 inches.
  – The percentage of the shark's body length covered is (48 ÷ 120) × 100 = 40%.

Unfortunately, 2 tables break. Carlos then eats one-fifth of all the almonds. How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?",14.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. A bowl can hold 24 almonds. A table holds three times as many, so a table holds 3 × 24 = 72 almonds.

2. Carlos originally has 7 bowls and 3 tables. However, 2 tables break, leaving him with only 1 working table.

3. The total capacity with the available containers is:
  • Bowls: 7 × 24 = 168 almonds  
  • Table: 1 × 72 = 72 almonds  
  • Combined capacity: 168 + 72 = 240 almonds.

4. Carlos has 720 almonds to start with. Then he eats one-fifth of them. One-fifth of 720 is 720 ÷ 5 = 144 almonds.  
  Remaining almonds = 720 – 144 = 576 almonds.

5. To place all 576 almonds, Carlos needs containers with a total capacity of at least 576 almonds. He already has a capacity of 240 almonds.

1. Diego is 19 years old.
2. In 9 years, Aisha will be 2 times as old as Diego is now. Since Diego is 19, 2 × 19 = 38. So, in 9 years, Aisha will be 38 years old.
3. To find Aisha's current age, subtract 9 from 38: 38 − 9 = 29.
4. Diego’s brother, Esteban, is 6 years younger than Diego. So Esteban is 19 − 6 = 13 years old.
5. Nadia is Aisha’s sister and is 10 years older than Esteban. Therefore, Nadia's age is 13 + 10 = 23.
6. In 4 years, each person will be 4 years older:

Keisha wants to make two warm jackets for herself, each needing 8 skeins of wool. Each dozen skeins of wool costs $7. The store has a promotion where customers receive a $20 discount on purchases over $100. How much should Keisha pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?",85.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of skeins needed for the grandchildren.  
• Shawl: 5 skeins for one child → 5 × 4 = 20 skeins  
• Sweater: 6 skeens for one child → 6 × 4 = 24 skeins  
• Poncho: 8 skeins for one child → 8 × 4 = 32 skeins  
• Gloves: 8 skeins for one pair for one child → 8 × 4 = 32 skeins  
• Mittens: 14 skeins for one pair for one child → 14 × 4 = 56 skeins  

Step 2: Calculate the total number of skeins needed for Keisha’s jackets.  
• Two jackets with 8 skeins each: 8 × 2 = 16 skeins  

Step 3: Add all the skeins together.  
Total skeins = 20 (shawls) + 24 (sweaters) + 32 (ponchos) + 32 (gloves) + 56 (mittens) + 16 (jackets)

How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.
1. Mohammed needs a week's worth of rice. Since he uses 3 kgs per day and there are 7 days in a week, he needs a total of 3 × 7 = 21 kgs of rice.
2. The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg, but the brand he buys costs 20% more. So, the new price per kg is 15 + (20% of 15) = 15 + 3 = ¥18 per kg.
3. The store has a 40% discount on up to 10 kgs of rice. With this discount, the price per kg for the first 10 kgs is 18 − (40% of 18) = 18 × 0.60 = ¥10.8.
4. For the remaining rice beyond 10 kgs, Mohammed pays the full price of ¥18 per kg. The remaining quantity is 21 − 10 = 11 kgs.
5. Now, calculate the cost:
   - Cost for the discounted 10 kgs = 10 × 10.8 = ¥108.
   - Cost for the remaining 11 kgs = 11 × 18 = ¥198.
   - Total cost for the rice = 108 + 198 = ¥306.

1. First, determine how many signatures each sister had already after 6 weeks:
  Jasmine has 36 signatures.
  Mia has 31 signatures.
  So together they have 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

2. Their goal is to reach 145 signatures. Thus, the number of signatures they still need is:

3. They have 2 weeks remaining. However, Jasmine’s collection rate changes. From the previous 6 weeks, Jasmine’s weekly average was:
  36 signatures ÷ 6 weeks = 6 signatures per week.
  But for the remaining 2 weeks, her weekly collection is reduced by 5, so she will collect:

1. First, calculate how many tiny cubes were made. Leon makes 48 total cubes, and we know he made:
   • 10 giant cubes  
   • 12 medium cubes

   So, the number of tiny cubes = 48 - (10 + 12 + 14) = 48 - 36 = 12.

2. Next, determine the amount of water used for each type of cube:

• Elena buys 15 anchors at $0.26 each.
  Cost for anchors = 15 × $0.26 = $3.90.
• She buys 9 nails at $0.61 each.
  Cost for nails = 9 × $0.61 = $5.49.
• She also picks up 10 gallons of paint. Since she is not a member, she pays the full price of $7.0 per gallon.
  Cost for paint = 10 × $7.0 = $70.00.

On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday and 21 boxes of apricot pie. On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?",796.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. On Wednesday:
   - Muffins: 27 boxes.
   - Apricot pies: The problem tells us that on Wednesday he sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie than on Thursday. Since we know from the next sentence that on Thursday he sold 21 boxes of apricot pie, Wednesday’s apricot pies = 21 – 13 = 8 boxes.

2. On Thursday:
   - Muffins: He sold 11 more boxes than on Wednesday. So, Thursday’s muffins = 27 + 11 = 38 boxes.
   - Apricot pies: 21 boxes (given).

3. On Friday:
   - He sold as much as he did in the past two days combined, meaning that for each type he sold the sum of Wednesday and Thursday. 
   - Muffins on Friday = 27 (Wednesday) + 38 (Thursday) = 65 boxes.
   - Apricot pies on Friday = 8 (Wednesday) + 21 (Thursday) = 29 boxes.

4. Now, calculate the earnings for each day:
   - The muffin costs ₺9 per box and the apricot pie costs ₺21 per box.
   
   • Wednesday’s earnings:
     - Muffins: 27 × 9 = ₺243.
     - Apricot pies: 8 × 21 = ₺168.
     - Total earning on Wednesday = 243 + 168 = ₺411.
     
   • Thursday’s earnings:
     - Muffins: 38 × 9 = ₺342.
     - Apricot pies: 21 × 21 = ₺441.
     - Total earning on Thursday = 342 + 441 = ₺783.
     
   • Friday’s earnings:
     - Muffins: 65 × 9 = ₺585.
     - Apricot pies: 29 × 21 = ₺609.
     - Total earning on Friday = 585 + 609 = ₺1194.

5. Find the total earnings for all three days:
   - Total earnings = 411 + 783 + 1194 = ₺2388.

6. Finally, calculate the average daily earning:

These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away tournament. Half of the swimmers are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the tournament?",66.0,,,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Mrs. Garcia’s class has 120 students.

2. First, 50% of the students are swimmers. That is:  
  Swimmers = 50% of 120 = 0.50 × 120 = 60.

3. The remaining students = 120 – 60 = 60.

4. The problem then tells us that “45% of the remaining class are choir members or part of dancers.” The wording “or” can be confusing, but note that later the problem refers to “these 3 groups” leaving early. This indicates that there are three separate groups:  
  • Swimmers  
  • Choir members  
  • Dancers

 To have 3 groups, the remaining 60 students must be divided into 2 groups – one for choir and one for dancers. (The 45% applies to each of these groups.)  
 Thus, choir members = 45% of 60 = 0.45 × 60 = 27  
  and dancers = 45% of 60 = 27  
 (That accounts for 27 + 27 = 54 students; the remaining 6 are not part of these groups and will not be leaving early.)

5. Now, the problem states “Half of the swimmers are absent for being sick.”  
  So, the swimmers who are present and leaving early = half of 60 = 60 ÷ 2 = 30.

6. At this point the groups leaving early from the class are:  
  Swimmers = 30  
  Choir members = 27  
  Dancers = 27  
 Their total = 30 + 27 + 27 = 84

7. Next, “3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups.” Since there are 3 groups, the number of cheerleaders is:  
  Cheerleaders = 3 groups × 3 cheerleaders/group = 9

8. Finally, the total number of students leaving early for the tournament is the sum of the group members plus the cheerleaders:  
  Total = 84 + 9 = 93

However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",31.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, determine how many plants are needed. Each plant’s placement takes up 12 meters along the flower bed (this 12-meter segment already includes the plant’s 3-meter width). Since the bed is 132 meters long, the number of plants that can be placed is:  
  Number of plants = 132 ÷ 12 = 11.

2. Olga already owns 7 plants, so she needs to buy the remainder:  
  Plants to buy = 11 – 7 = 4.

3. Each plant costs ₣9. Without any discount, the total cost for 4 plants would be:  
  4 × 9 = ₣36.

4. There is an offer that if more than 2 plants are purchased, a ₣5 discount is applied to the entire purchase. Since 4 plants are being bought (which is more than 2), the discount applies. So, the final cost is:

Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.,163.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Washing the clams:
   • It takes 12 seconds to wash one clam.
   • Since 12 seconds = 0.2 minutes, washing 150 clams takes 150 × 0.2 = 30 minutes.

2. Peeling the clams:
   • Olga can peel 6 clams per minute.
   • To peel 150 clams, she will need 150 / 6 = 25 minutes.

3. Taking a break:
   • After peeling, she takes a 13-minute break before starting to sauté.

4. Sautéing the clams:
   • Olga can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes.
   • To sauté 150 clams, she will need (150 / 30) × 19 = 5 × 19 = 95 minutes.

5. Adding all the times:
   • Washing: 30 minutes
   • Peeling: 25 minutes
   • Break: 13 minutes
   • Sautéing: 95 minutes
   • Total time = 30 + 25 + 13 + 95 = 163 minutes

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 50% for the second half. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?",1755.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, determine the daily pizza consumption before any diet:
 • The uncle eats 10 pizzas per day.
 • The spouse eats 20 pizzas per day.
 • Their combined consumption is 10 + 20 = 30 pizzas per day.
 • The grandchild eats two-fourths (or 1/2) of this combined number:
  ◦ Grandchild's consumption = 1/2 × 30 = 15 pizzas per day.
 • So, the total daily consumption is 10 + 20 + 15 = 45 pizzas.

2. In the first month, there is no diet. Assuming the month has 30 days:
 • Total pizzas in month 1 = 45 pizzas/day × 30 days = 1350 pizzas.

3. In the second month, the family goes on a diet:
 • For the first half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by 60%. This means they eat 40% of the normal amount:
  ◦ Daily consumption during the first half = 45 × 0.40 = 18 pizzas.
  ◦ Total for the first half = 18 pizzas/day × 15 days = 270 pizzas.
 • For the second half of the month (15 days), they reduce their (already reduced) consumption by an additional 50%. That means:
  ◦ Daily consumption during the second half = 18 × 0.50 = 9 pizzas.
  ◦ Total for the second half = 9 pizzas/day × 15 days = 135 pizzas.
 • So, total pizzas in month 2 = 270 + 135 = 405 pizzas.

1. The Sports Arena has a total of 9600 seats.
2. Out of these, 700 seats are reserved for graduates, 450 seats for faculty, and 50 seats for the event's staff.
3. First, we find the total number of reserved seats: 700 + 450 + 50 = 1200.
4. Next, we determine the remaining seats available for distribution by subtracting the reserved seats from the total seats: 9600 - 1200 = 8400.

1. Originally, let Ananya’s beach speed be R (in miles per minute). Then, her sidewalk speed is 2R.
2. Due to her injury, her speeds are halved. So her new beach speed is (1/2)R, and her new sidewalk speed is (1/2) × 2R = R.

Olivia, who is younger than Bodhi but older than Keisha, will be 42 in 7 years. How much younger is Keisha than the average age of all three?",18.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. In 7 years, Olivia will be 42. So, her current age is 42 - 7 = 35.  
2. Olivia is 24 years younger than Bodhi. Therefore, Bodhi's current age is 35 + 24 = 59.  
3. Olivia is 15 years older than Keisha. Therefore, Keisha's current age is 35 - 15 = 20.  
4. The average age of the three is (59 + 35 + 20) / 3 = 114 / 3 = 38.  
5. Keisha is 20 years old, which is 38 - 20 = 18 years younger than the average age.

The answer is 18.",18.0,1
