p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Sophia went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, and 60 mini cheesecakes. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,"To find the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen, we can start by calculating the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes before the discount.

1. **Calculate the cost of the donuts:**
   - Sophia bought 60 donuts.
   - Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, the number of dozens of donuts she bought is:
     \[
     \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ dozens}
     \]
   - The cost per dozen of donuts is $19, so the total cost for the donuts is:
     \[
     5 \text{ dozens} \times 19 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 95 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:**
   - Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes.
   - The number of dozens of mini cupcakes she bought is:
     \[
     \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ dozens}
     \]
   - The cost per dozen of mini cupcakes is $33, so the total cost for the mini cupcakes is:
     \[
     5 \text{ dozens} \times 33 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 165 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   - Let \( x \) be the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen.
   - The total cost of the mini cheesecakes for 60 mini cheesecakes (5 dozens) is:
     \[
     5 \text{ dozens} \times x \text{ dollars/dozen} = 5x \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost before the discount is:
     \[
     95 + 165 + 5x = 260 + 5x \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Apply the 20% discount:**
   - After a 20% discount, Sophia paid 80% of the total cost:
     \[
     0.8 \times (260 + 5x) = 1500
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - First, divide both sides by 0.8:
     \[
     260 + 5x = \frac{1500}{0.8} = 1875
     \]
   - Now, isolate \( 5x \):
     \[
     5x = 1875 - 260 = 1615
     \]
   - Finally, divide by 5 to find \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{1615}{5} = 323
     \]

Thus, the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is **$323**.",323.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the donuts:**
   - Sophia bought 60 donuts.
   - Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, she bought \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $19.
   - So, the total cost for the donuts is \( 5 \times 19 = 95 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:**
   - Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes.
   - Again, since there are 12 mini cupcakes in a dozen, she bought \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $33.
   - So, the total cost for the mini cupcakes is \( 5 \times 33 = 165 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   - Let \( x \) be the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen.
   - She bought 60 mini cheesecakes, which is also \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozen.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the mini cheesecakes is \( 5x \) dollars.
   - The total cost before the discount is \( 95 + 165 + 5x \).

4. **Apply the 20% discount:**
   - The total amount paid after the discount is $1500.
   - The total cost before the discount can be expressed as \( 0.8 \times (95 + 165 + 5x) = 1500 \).

5. **Set up the equation:**
   - \( 0.8 \times (260 + 5x) = 1500 \).
   - Dividing both sides by 0.8 gives \( 260 + 5x = \frac{1500}{0.8} = 1875 \).

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 260 from both sides: \( 5x = 1875 - 260 = 1615 \).
   - Divide by 5: \( x = \frac{1615}{5} = 323 \).

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is $323.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving. A 300 grams bag has 6 servings. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?",350.0,"To determine how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara, we first need to calculate their remaining calorie allowances based on their daily calorie targets and what they have already consumed.

### Step 1: Calculate Daily Calorie Target
1. **Hiroshi's Weight**: 220 lbs
   - Daily Calorie Target = 15 calories/pound × 220 lbs = 3300 calories

2. **Tara's Weight**: 140 lbs
   - Daily Calorie Target = 15 calories/pound × 140 lbs = 2100 calories

### Step 2: Calculate Remaining Calories
1. **Hiroshi's Caloric Situation**:
   - Calories Consumed: 1100 calories (food) + 200 calories (exercise) = 1300 calories
   - Calories Burned: 200 calories (exercise)
   - Total Calories Available = 3300 calories (target) - 1300 calories (consumed) = 2000 calories remaining

2. **Tara's Caloric Situation**:
   - Calories Consumed: 900 calories (food) + 200 calories (ice cream) = 1100 calories
   - Total Calories Available = 2100 calories (target) - 1100 calories (consumed) = 1000 calories remaining

### Step 3: Calculate Popcorn Servings Needed
1. **Calories per Serving of Popcorn**: 200 calories
2. **Hiroshi's Remaining Servings**:
   - Remaining Calories = 2000 calories
   - Servings of Popcorn = 2000 calories / 200 calories per serving = 10 servings

3. **Tara's Remaining Servings**:
   - Remaining Calories = 1000 calories
   - Servings of Popcorn = 1000 calories / 200 calories per serving = 5 servings

### Step 4: Calculate Grams of Popcorn
1. **Total Grams of Popcorn in a Bag**: 300 grams
2. **Grams per Serving**: 300 grams / 6 servings = 50 grams per serving

3. **Hiroshi's Total Grams of Popcorn**:
   - Total Grams = 10 servings × 50 grams/serving = 500 grams

4. **Tara's Total Grams of Popcorn**:
   - Total Grams = 5 servings × 50 grams/serving = 250 grams

### Step 5: Calculate the Difference
- Difference in grams of popcorn = Hiroshi's grams - Tara's grams
- Difference = 500 grams - 250 grams = 250 grams

### Conclusion
Hiroshi needs to consume **250 grams more popcorn** than Tara.",250.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate Hiroshi's daily calorie target:**
   - Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs.
   - The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight.
   - So, Hiroshi's target is 220 lbs * 15 calories/lb = 3300 calories.

2. **Calculate Hiroshi's net calorie intake:**
   - Hiroshi has already consumed 1100 calories.
   - He has burned 200 calories through exercise.
   - So, his net calorie intake is 1100 - 200 = 900 calories.

3. **Calculate how many more calories Hiroshi can consume:**
   - Hiroshi's remaining calorie allowance is 3300 - 900 = 2400 calories.

4. **Calculate the calories in one serving of popcorn:**
   - Each serving of popcorn has 200 calories.
   - Hiroshi's bag has 6 servings, so the total calories in the bag is 6 * 200 = 1200 calories.

5. **Calculate how many servings of popcorn Hiroshi can consume:**
   - To find out how many servings he can consume with his remaining calorie allowance, we divide:
   - 2400 calories / 200 calories per serving = 12 servings.

6. **Calculate the total grams of popcorn Hiroshi can consume:**
   - Each serving corresponds to a portion of the 300 grams bag.
   - Since there are 6 servings in the bag, each serving is 300 grams / 6 = 50 grams.
   - Therefore, 12 servings would be 12 * 50 grams = 600 grams.

7. **Calculate Tara's daily calorie target:**
   - Tara weighs 140 lbs.
   - Her target is 140 lbs * 15 calories/lb = 2100 calories.

8. **Calculate Tara's net calorie intake:**
   - Tara has consumed 900 calories in food and 200 calories in ice cream.
   - So, her total consumption is 900 + 200 = 1100 calories.

9. **Calculate how many more calories Tara can consume:**
   - Tara's remaining calorie allowance is 2100 - 1100 = 1000 calories.

10. **Calculate how many servings of popcorn Tara can consume:**
    - With her remaining calorie allowance, she can consume:
    - 1000 calories / 200 calories per serving = 5 servings.

11. **Calculate the total grams of popcorn Tara can consume:**
    - Each serving is 50 grams, so 5 servings would be 5 * 50 grams = 250 grams.

12. **Calculate how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara:**
    - Hiroshi can consume 600 grams, and Tara can consume 250 grams.
    - The difference is 600 grams - 250 grams = 350 grams.

The answer is 350 grams.",350.0,1,0,1,350.0,,,

She already has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges of her large country home. She also purchased 200 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Daphne remain with?",335.0,"To find out how many potted plants Daphne will have remaining, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of potted plants Daphne currently has:**
   - She has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges.
   - Total plants from ledges = 8 plants/ledge × 56 ledges = 448 plants.
   - She received 23 new potted plants from the nursery.
   - Total plants after receiving new ones = 448 plants + 23 plants = 471 plants.
   - She purchased 200 new plants yesterday.

2. **Calculate the number of potted plants she will give away:**
   - She plans to give away 6 potted plants from each ledge.
   - Total plants given away = 6 plants/ledge × 56 ledges = 336 plants.

3. **Calculate the remaining number of potted plants:**
   - Remaining plants = Total plants - Plants given away = 671 plants - 336 plants = 335 plants.

Thus, Daphne will remain with **335 potted plants**.",335.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **New Potted Plants Received**: Daphne received 23 new potted plants from the nursery.

2. **Existing Potted Plants**: She has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges. 
   - To find the total number of existing potted plants, we calculate:
     \[
     8 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 56 \text{ ledges} = 448 \text{ plants}
     \]

3. **Total Potted Plants After Receiving New Ones**: Now, we add the new potted plants to her existing ones:
   \[
   448 \text{ existing plants} + 23 \text{ new plants} = 471 \text{ plants}

However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city, we first need to understand the initial conditions and the effect of the wind speed change.

1. **City Size**: The city is 80 miles across.
2. **Distance to Cover 1/4 of the City**: 
   \[
   \text{1/4 of the city} = \frac{80 \text{ miles}}{4} = 20 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Fog Coverage Rate**: The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes. We can calculate the rate of coverage:
   \[
   \text{Rate} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{15 \text{ minutes}}
   \]

4. **Time to Cover 20 Miles at Initial Rate**:
   To find out how long it would take to cover 20 miles at the initial rate:
   \[
   \text{Time} = 20 \text{ miles} \times 15 \text{ minutes/mile} = 300 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Effect of Wind Speed Halving**: The problem states that the wind speed will be halved in one hour. This means that after 60 minutes, the fog will cover less distance than it would have at the original rate.

   - In the first hour (60 minutes), the fog covers:
   \[
   4 \text{ miles}
   \]
   - After 60 minutes, the wind speed is halved, which means the fog will cover half the distance in the same amount of time. Therefore, the new rate becomes:
   \[
   \text{New Rate} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \div 2 = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{30 \text{ minutes}}
   \]

6. **Total Distance Covered After 60 Minutes**: After the first hour, the fog has covered 4 miles.

7. **Remaining Distance to Cover**: 
   \[
   \text{Remaining Distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} = 16 \text{ miles}

9. **Total Time to Cover 20 Miles**:
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 60 \text{ minutes} + 480 \text{ minutes} = 540 \text{ minutes}

1. The city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge.
2. We need to find out how long it takes for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city.
3. 1/4 of the city is 80 miles / 4 = 20 miles.
4. The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes.
5. To find out how long it takes to cover 1 mile, we can calculate: 
   - 60 minutes / 4 miles = 15 minutes per mile.
6. Now, we need to find out how long it takes to cover 20 miles:
   - 20 miles * 15 minutes per mile = 300 minutes.
7. However, we need to consider that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. This means that after 60 minutes, the fog bank will cover less distance.
8. In the first hour (60 minutes), the fog bank covers 4 miles.
9. After the first hour, the wind speed is halved, so the fog bank will cover only 2 miles in the next hour (60 minutes).
10. Therefore, in the first 60 minutes, the fog bank covers 4 miles, and in the next 60 minutes, it covers 2 miles, totaling 6 miles in 120 minutes.
11. To cover the remaining 14 miles (20 miles - 6 miles), we need to calculate how long it will take with the halved speed:
    - At the halved speed, it takes 30 minutes to cover 1 mile (60 minutes / 2 miles).
    - So, for 14 miles, it will take 14 miles * 30 minutes per mile = 420 minutes.
12. Adding the initial 120 minutes to cover the first 6 miles gives us:

On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 2-hour episodes. On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?",6.0,"To find out how many 15-minute episodes Santiago watched on Thursday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he spent watching TV from Tuesday to Sunday, excluding Thursday.

1. **Tuesday**: Watched 4 hours.
2. **Wednesday**: Watched 4 hours.
3. **Thursday**: Watched \( x \) episodes of 15 minutes each (we will calculate this later).
4. **Friday**: Watched 3 hours and 45 minutes.
   - Convert 3 hours and 45 minutes to hours: 
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} + \frac{45 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 \text{ hours}

She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, and uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the ratios and the total amounts used by Nia.

1. **Understanding the Ratios**:
   - The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 54:27. This can be simplified:
     \[
     \frac{54}{27} = 2
     \]
   - This means for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, there are 1 cup of water.

2. **Milk and Cream Ratios**:
   - Nia uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, which simplifies to 1 tablespoon of milk per cup of water.
   - She uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar.

3. **Setting Up the Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of teaspoons of sugar used.
   - From the sugar to water ratio, the number of cups of water used will be \( \frac{x}{2} \).
   - The number of tablespoons of milk used will be equal to the number of cups of water, which is \( \frac{x}{2} \).
   - The number of tablespoons of heavy cream used will be \( 2x \) (since she uses 2 tablespoons of cream for every teaspoon of sugar).

4. **Total Amount Used**:
   - The total amount of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is given as 240. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x + \frac{x}{2} = 240
   \]

5. **Combining Like Terms**:
   - Combine the terms:
   \[
   x + 2x + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} = 240
   \]
   - This simplifies to:
   \[
   3x + x = 240
   \]
   - Which further simplifies to:
   \[
   4x = 240
   \]

6. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = \frac{240}{4} = 60

Thus, the number of teaspoons of sugar Nia used is \( \boxed{60} \).",60.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Understanding the ratios**: Nia uses sugar and water in a ratio of 54:27. This means for every 54 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 27 cups of water.

2. **Finding the total parts in the ratio**: The total parts in the ratio of sugar to water is 54 + 27 = 81 parts.

3. **Calculating the amount of each part**: Nia used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. We need to find out how many of these parts correspond to sugar and water.

4. **Finding the amount of sugar and water in the total**: 
   - The ratio of sugar to the total parts is 54/81.
   - The ratio of water to the total parts is 27/81.

5. **Calculating the amount of sugar**:
   - The amount of sugar used is (54/81) * 240 = (54 * 240) / 81.
   - Calculating this gives us: 54 * 240 = 12960.
   - Now, divide by 81: 12960 / 81 = 160.

6. **Conclusion**: Nia used 160 teaspoons of sugar.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Nia makes tea using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 54:27. She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, and uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 160.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I initially miscalculated the total amounts by not properly considering the ratios and the total number of ingredients used. I failed to account for the relationships between the different components (sugar, water, milk, and cream) and how they contribute to the total of 240 teaspoons, cups, and tablespoons. This led to an incorrect conclusion about the amount of sugar used.

### Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of ratios
- Incorrect total calculation
- Failure to account for all components

### Instructions:
1. Identify the ratios given in the problem: sugar to water is 54:27, and there are additional ratios for milk and cream.
2. Simplify the sugar to water ratio: 54:27 simplifies to 2:1 (since both can be divided by 27).
3. Let the amount of sugar be represented as \(2x\) and the amount of water as \(x\).
4. Calculate the total parts from the sugar and water ratio: \(2 + 1 = 3\) parts.
5. Determine the total amount of milk and cream used: since 8 tablespoons of milk are used for every 8 cups of water, and 2 tablespoons of cream for every teaspoon of sugar, we need to express these in terms of the ratios.
6. Set up the equation for the total: \(2x + x + \text{milk} + \text{cream} = 240\).
7. Express milk and cream in terms of \(x\):
   - For milk: Since 8 tablespoons of milk correspond to 8 cups of water, and \(x\) cups of water corresponds to \(x\) tablespoons of milk.
   - For cream: Since 2 tablespoons of cream correspond to 1 teaspoon of sugar, \(2x\) teaspoons of sugar correspond to \(2 \cdot 2x = 4x\) tablespoons of cream.
8. Substitute these into the total equation: \(2x + x + x + 4x = 240\).
9. Combine like terms: \(8x = 240\).
10. Solve for \(x\): \(x = 30\).
11. Calculate the amount of sugar: \(2x = 2 \cdot 30 = 60\) teaspoons of sugar.

### Advice:
- Always simplify ratios before using them in calculations.
- Ensure that all components of the problem are accounted for in the total.
- Break down the problem into manageable parts and express everything in terms of a single variable when possible.
- Double-check calculations to ensure that all relationships and ratios are correctly applied.

### Solution:
Nia used **60 teaspoons of sugar**.","--- Beginning of the template ---

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Aisha was preparing for a lunch party at her house, where she intended to serve stuffed peppers. She noticed that she was out of plastic forks, so she bought a new package of forks. Later, her husband also bought a package of 8 new forks and gave them to Aisha. While Aisha was making the stuffed peppers, she used sixteen of the forks to sample her stuffed peppers, then threw away 6 defective forks. The guests also brought 2 packs of forks, each having 6 inside them. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 32 forks. How many forks were in the package that Aisha bought?",34.0,"Let's denote the number of forks in the package that Aisha bought as \( x \).

1. Aisha bought \( x \) forks.
2. Her husband bought 8 forks.
3. Aisha used 16 forks to sample the stuffed peppers.
4. Aisha threw away 6 defective forks.
5. The guests brought 2 packs of forks, each containing 6 forks, which totals \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) forks.

Now, we can set up the equation to find the total number of forks Aisha had after all these transactions:

\[
\text{Total forks} = \text{Aisha's forks} + \text{Husband's forks} + \text{Guests' forks} - \text{Used forks} - \text{Defective forks}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
32 = x + 8 + 12 - 16 - 6
\]

Now, simplify the right side:

\[
32 = x + 8 + 12 - 16 - 6
\]
\[
32 = x + 20 - 22
\]
\[
32 = x - 2
\]

Now, solve for \( x \):

Thus, the number of forks in the package that Aisha bought is \( \boxed{34} \).",34.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of forks in the package that Aisha bought.
2. Aisha's husband bought 8 new forks, so now she has \( x + 8 \) forks.
3. Aisha used 16 forks to sample her stuffed peppers, so the number of forks left is \( x + 8 - 16 = x - 8 \).
4. Aisha threw away 6 defective forks, so now she has \( x - 8 - 6 = x - 14 \) forks.
5. The guests brought 2 packs of forks, each containing 6 forks, which totals \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) forks.
6. Adding the forks from the guests, the total number of forks is \( (x - 14) + 12 = x - 2 \).
7. We know that this total equals 32 forks, so we set up the equation:

In addition, Ravi owns a 13-square yard apricot field that produces 12 apricots per square yard. The apricots can be harvested every 4 months. In the span of two years, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?",1764.0,"To find out how many more bananas Ravi harvests than apricots in two years, we will first calculate the total harvest of bananas and apricots over that period.

### Step 1: Calculate the total bananas harvested in two years.

1. **Banana field area**: 10 square yards.
2. **Bananas per four-fifths of a square yard**: 36 bananas.
3. **Bananas per square yard**: 
   \[
   \text{Bananas per square yard} = \frac{36 \text{ bananas}}{\frac{4}{5} \text{ square yards}} = 36 \times \frac{5}{4} = 45 \text{ bananas per square yard}
   \]
4. **Total bananas in 10 square yards**:
   \[
   \text{Total bananas} = 10 \text{ square yards} \times 45 \text{ bananas per square yard} = 450 \text{ bananas}
   \]
5. **Harvest frequency**: Every 4 months means 3 times a year.
6. **Total harvests in 2 years**: 
   \[
   2 \text{ years} \times 3 \text{ harvests per year} = 6 \text{ harvests}
   \]
7. **Total bananas harvested in 2 years**:
   \[
   \text{Total bananas in 2 years} = 450 \text{ bananas} \times 6 = 2700 \text{ bananas}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total apricots harvested in two years.

1. **Apricot field area**: 13 square yards.
2. **Apricots per square yard**: 12 apricots.
3. **Total apricots in 13 square yards**:
   \[
   \text{Total apricots} = 13 \text{ square yards} \times 12 \text{ apricots per square yard} = 156 \text{ apricots}

### Step 3: Calculate the difference between bananas and apricots harvested.

1. **Difference**:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total bananas} - \text{Total apricots} = 2700 \text{ bananas} - 936 \text{ apricots} = 1764
   \]

### Conclusion

Ravi harvests **1764 more bananas** than apricots in the span of two years.",1764.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total area of the banana field:**
   Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field.

2. **Determine the number of bananas produced per square yard:**
   There are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard. To find out how many bananas are produced per square yard, we can set up a proportion:
   \[
   \text{Bananas per square yard} = \frac{36 \text{ bananas}}{\frac{4}{5} \text{ square yards}} = 36 \times \frac{5}{4} = 45 \text{ bananas per square yard}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of bananas harvested:**
   The total number of bananas in the 10 square yards is:
   \[
   10 \text{ square yards} \times 45 \text{ bananas per square yard} = 450 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. **Determine the harvest frequency for bananas:**
   Ravi can harvest his bananas every 4 months. In 2 years, there are:
   \[
   2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months}
   \]
   The number of harvests in 2 years is:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ months}}{4 \text{ months/harvest}} = 6 \text{ harvests}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of bananas harvested in 2 years:**
   The total number of bananas harvested in 2 years is:
   \[
   450 \text{ bananas/harvest} \times 6 \text{ harvests} = 2700 \text{ bananas}

   \]

9. **Determine the harvest frequency for apricots:**
   Ravi can harvest his apricots every 4 months, just like the bananas. Therefore, the number of harvests in 2 years is also 6.

10. **Calculate the total number of apricots harvested in 2 years:**
    The total number of apricots harvested in 2 years is:
    \[
    156 \text{ apricots/harvest} \times 6 \text{ harvests} = 936 \text{ apricots}
    \]

11. **Calculate the difference in the number of bananas and apricots harvested:**

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Arjun went to buy some school supplies. He bought 12 folders which cost $4.75 each, 8 erasers which cost $14.5 each, and a ream of bond paper which cost $11. He also bought 7 pencils which cost $8 each. Arjun can either pay a one-time $20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases, or not become a member and receive only a 5% discount. What is the least amount Arjun can spend on everything?",212.0,"To determine the least amount Arjun can spend, we will first calculate the total cost of the school supplies without any discounts, then apply the discounts for both membership options, and finally compare the two totals.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost without discounts

1. **Cost of folders**:
   \[
   12 \text{ folders} \times 4.75 \text{ dollars/folder} = 57.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of erasers**:
   \[
   8 \text{ erasers} \times 14.5 \text{ dollars/eraser} = 116.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of bond paper**:
   \[
   1 \text{ ream} \times 11 \text{ dollars/ream} = 11.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of pencils**:
   \[
   7 \text{ pencils} \times 8 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 56.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum these costs:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 57.00 + 116.00 + 11.00 + 56.00 = 240.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost with discounts

#### Option 1: Become a member and get a 20% discount

1. **Calculate the discount**:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 20\% \text{ of } 240.00 = 0.20 \times 240.00 = 48.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total after discount**:
   \[
   \text{Total after discount} = 240.00 - 48.00 = 192.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Add the membership fee**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost with membership} = 192.00 + 20.00 = 212.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

#### Option 2: Not become a member and get a 5% discount

1. **Calculate the discount**:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 5\% \text{ of } 240.00 = 0.05 \times 240.00 = 12.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total after discount**:
   \[
   \text{Total after discount} = 240.00 - 12.00 = 228.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 3: Compare the total costs

- Total cost with membership: **$212.00**
- Total cost without membership: **$228.00**

### Conclusion

The least amount Arjun can spend is:
\[
\boxed{212.00} \text{ dollars}
\]",212.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost without any discounts:**
   - Cost of folders: 12 folders * $4.75 each = 12 * 4.75 = $57.00
   - Cost of erasers: 8 erasers * $14.50 each = 8 * 14.50 = $116.00
   - Cost of bond paper: 1 ream * $11.00 = $11.00
   - Cost of pencils: 7 pencils * $8.00 each = 7 * 8 = $56.00

   Now, let's add these costs together:
   - Total cost = $57.00 + $116.00 + $11.00 + $56.00 = $240.00

2. **Calculate the total cost with the membership and 20% discount:**
   - Membership fee = $20.00
   - Total cost before discount = $240.00
   - Discount = 20% of $240.00 = 0.20 * 240 = $48.00
   - Total cost with membership = Total cost - Discount + Membership fee
   - Total cost with membership = $240.00 - $48.00 + $20.00 = $212.00

3. **Calculate the total cost without membership and with a 5% discount:**
   - Total cost before discount = $240.00
   - Discount = 5% of $240.00 = 0.05 * 240 = $12.00
   - Total cost without membership = Total cost - Discount
   - Total cost without membership = $240.00 - $12.00 = $228.00

4. **Compare the two total costs:**
   - Total cost with membership = $212.00
   - Total cost without membership = $228.00

5. **Determine the least amount Arjun can spend:**
   - The least amount Arjun can spend is $212.00 (with membership).

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Yusuf is rolling a twenty-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row, than that he rolls four even numbers in a row?",50.0,"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events: rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row and rolling four even numbers in a row with a twenty-sided die.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5.

A twenty-sided die has the numbers 1 through 20. The numbers greater than 5 are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. 

Counting these, we find:
- Numbers greater than 5: 15 (from 6 to 20)

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is:
\[
P(\text{greater than 5}) = \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is:
\[
P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) = P(\text{greater than 5}) \times P(\text{greater than 5}) = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) \times \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \frac{9}{16}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the probability of rolling an even number.

The even numbers on a twenty-sided die are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20. 

Counting these, we find:
- Even numbers: 10 (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20)

The probability of rolling an even number is:
\[
P(\text{even}) = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling an even number four times in a row is:
\[
P(\text{even four times}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16}
\]

### Step 5: Compare the two probabilities.

Now we have:
- Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice: \(\frac{9}{16}\)
- Probability of rolling four even numbers: \(\frac{1}{16}\)

### Step 6: Calculate the difference in percentage points.

To find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 5 twice than to roll four even numbers, we calculate:
\[
\text{Difference} = P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) - P(\text{even four times}) = \frac{9}{16} - \frac{1}{16} = \frac{8}{16} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 7: Convert the difference to percentage points.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
\]

Thus, the difference in likelihood, expressed in percentage points, is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]",50.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a twenty-sided die.**
   - The numbers greater than 5 on a twenty-sided die are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. 
   - There are 15 numbers greater than 5.
   - The total number of outcomes on a twenty-sided die is 20.
   - So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is:
     \[
     P(\text{greater than 5}) = \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row.**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is:
     \[
     P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) = P(\text{greater than 5}) \times P(\text{greater than 5}) = 0.75 \times 0.75 = 0.5625
     \]

3. **Determine the probability of rolling an even number on a twenty-sided die.**
   - The even numbers on a twenty-sided die are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20.
   - There are 10 even numbers.
   - So, the probability of rolling an even number is:
     \[
     P(\text{even}) = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]

4. **Calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row.**
   - The probability of rolling an even number four times in a row is:
     \[
     P(\text{even four times}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.5^4 = 0.0625
     \]

5. **Calculate the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row and rolling four even numbers in a row.**
   - The difference is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) - P(\text{even four times}) = 0.5625 - 0.0625 = 0.5
     \]

6. **Convert the difference to percentage points.**

Mia then found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. In addition, she saw 24 wasps, and 9 bees. What percentage of animals in the plot were rabbits?",20.0,"To find the percentage of animals in the plot that were rabbits, we first need to determine the total number of animals and the number of rabbits.

1. **Calculate the number of rabbits:**
   Mia found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
   \]

2. **Count the other animals:**
   - Number of bees = 9
   - Number of wasps = 24
   - Number of beetles = \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the number of bees. Since there are 9 bees:
     \[
     \text{Number of beetles} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of animals:**
   Now we can sum all the animals:
   \[
   \text{Total animals} = \text{Number of rabbits} + \text{Number of bees} + \text{Number of wasps} + \text{Number of beetles}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total animals} = 13 + 9 + 24 + 6 = 52
   \]

4. **Calculate the percentage of rabbits:**
   The percentage of rabbits in the total number of animals is given by:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of rabbits} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of rabbits}}{\text{Total animals}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of rabbits} = \left( \frac{13}{52} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Simplifying \( \frac{13}{52} \):
   \[
   \frac{13}{52} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
   \]
   Now calculating the percentage:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of rabbits} = 0.25 \times 100 = 25\%
   \]

Thus, the percentage of animals in the plot that were rabbits is \( \boxed{25\%} \).",25.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Mia found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. 
   - Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13.
   - So, there are 13 rabbits.

2. Mia also saw 24 wasps and 9 bees.
   - The total number of animals is the sum of rabbits, wasps, and bees.
   - Total animals = 13 (rabbits) + 24 (wasps) + 9 (bees) = 46.

3. Now, we need to find the percentage of animals that were rabbits.
   - The number of rabbits is 13.
   - The total number of animals is 46.
   - To find the percentage of rabbits, we use the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Percentage of rabbits} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of rabbits}}{\text{Total number of animals}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Plugging in the numbers:
     \[
     \text{Percentage of rabbits} = \left( \frac{13}{46} \right) \times 100 \approx 28.26
     \]

4. Rounding to two decimal places, the percentage of animals in the plot that were rabbits is approximately 28.26%.

The answer is approximately 28.26%.",28.26,0,1,0,25.0,"--- Beginning of the template ---

1. **Identify the animals and their quantities:**
   - Bees: 9
   - Wasps: 24
   - White animals: 26 (half of which are rabbits)
   
2. **Calculate the number of rabbits:**
   - Since half of the 26 white animals are rabbits, the number of rabbits is:
     \[
     \text{Rabbits} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
     \]

3. **Determine the number of beetles:**
   - The problem states that there are \( \frac{2}{3} \) as many beetles as bees. Therefore, the number of beetles is:
     \[
     \text{Beetles} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of animals:**
   - Total animals = Bees + Wasps + Rabbits + Beetles
   \[
   \text{Total} = 9 + 24 + 13 + 6 = 52
   \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of rabbits:**
   - The percentage of rabbits in the total number of animals is given by:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of rabbits} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of rabbits}}{\text{Total number of animals}} \right) \times 100

- Total count miscalculation
Instructions:
1. Define the variables: Let C be the number of chickens and D be the number of ducks.
2. Set up the ratio: D = (3/4)C.
3. Set up the total equation: C + D = 40.
4. Substitute the expression for D into the total equation: C + (3/4)C = 40.
5. Combine like terms: (7/4)C = 40.
6. Solve for C: C = 40 * (4/7) = 22.86 (not possible, so check calculations).
7. Re-evaluate the setup and solve correctly.
8. Calculate D using the correct value of C.
Advice:
- Always check that your assumptions fit within the constraints of the problem.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts and solve step-by-step.
- Double-check your calculations to ensure they align with the total given.
Solution:
The correct reasoning leads to finding that there are 24 ducks, as the correct calculations show that if C = 16, then D = 12, fitting the total of 40 animals.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Mrs. Lee is looking for a new townhouse that will not go beyond her $340000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $400000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?",11000.0,"To determine how much more the total cost will be than Mrs. Lee's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the townhouse after applying the discount and adding the brokerage and transfer fees.

1. **Calculate the discount on the selling price:**
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = 400,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 25\% \text{ of Selling Price} = 0.25 \times 400,000 = 100,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Discount} = 400,000 - 100,000 = 300,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee (5% of the selling price):**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 5\% \text{ of Selling Price} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the transfer fee (12% of the selling price):**
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 12\% \text{ of Selling Price} = 0.12 \times 400,000 = 48,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Discounted Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 300,000 + 20,000 + 48,000 = 368,000
   \]

5. **Determine how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Lee's budget:**
   \[
   \text{Budget} = 340,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount Over Budget} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Budget} = 368,000 - 340,000 = 28,000
   \]

Thus, the total cost will be **$28,000** more than Mrs. Lee's budget.",28000.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Selling Price of the Property**: The selling price is $400,000.

2. **Discount Calculation**: Mrs. Lee can get a 25% discount on the selling price.
   - Discount amount = 25% of $400,000 = 0.25 * $400,000 = $100,000.
   - Selling price after discount = $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000.

3. **Brokerage Fee Calculation**: The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   - Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

4. **Transfer Fee Calculation**: The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.
   - Transfer fee = 12% of $400,000 = 0.12 * $400,000 = $48,000.

5. **Total Cost Calculation**: Now, we add the selling price after discount, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to find the total cost.
   - Total cost = Selling price after discount + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
   - Total cost = $300,000 + $20,000 + $48,000 = $368,000.

6. **Budget Comparison**: Mrs. Lee's budget is $340,000. We need to find out how much more the total cost is than her budget.
   - Amount over budget = Total cost - Budget
   - Amount over budget = $368,000 - $340,000 = $28,000.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Mrs. Lee is looking for a new townhouse that will not go beyond her $340000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $400000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the total cost by not properly accounting for the discount before applying the brokerage and transfer fees. I also failed to correctly sum the total costs and compare it to Mrs. Lee's budget. 

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect order of operations
- Budget comparison error

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the discount on the selling price:**
   - Selling price: $400,000
   - Discount: 25% of $400,000 = 0.25 * $400,000 = $100,000
   - Discounted price: $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   - Brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

3. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   - Transfer fee: 12% of $400,000 = 0.12 * $400,000 = $48,000

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Discounted price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
   - Total cost = $300,000 + $20,000 + $48,000 = $368,000

5. **Compare the total cost to the budget:**
   - Budget: $340,000
   - Excess amount needed: $368,000 - $340,000 = $28,000

### Instructions:
1. Identify the selling price and the budget.
2. Calculate the discount based on the selling price.
3. Subtract the discount from the selling price to find the discounted price.
4. Calculate the brokerage fee as a percentage of the original selling price.
5. Calculate the transfer fee as a percentage of the original selling price.
6. Add the discounted price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee to find the total cost.
7. Compare the total cost to the budget to determine how much more is needed.

### Advice:
- Always apply discounts before calculating additional fees.
- Ensure that you are using the correct base amount for percentage calculations.
- Double-check your final calculations and comparisons to avoid errors.","--- Beginning of the template ---

He paid the legal fees that amounted to 2% of the selling price and also paid a realtor fee that is 5% of the selling price. He also paid $440000 for the remaining loan amount on the villa, and $5000 for closing costs. Dr. Brown used the net proceeds from selling the villa to invest in stocks. The stocks gained 10% each year for two years. How much were Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years?",80465.0,"To find Dr. Brown's net proceeds after selling his villa and investing the money in stocks, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total selling costs (legal fees and realtor fees).**
2. **Determine the net proceeds from the sale of the villa.**
3. **Calculate the value of the investment in stocks after two years.**

### Step 1: Calculate Selling Costs

**Selling Price of the Villa:** $550,000

**Legal Fees:**  
Legal fees are 2% of the selling price.  
\[
\text{Legal Fees} = 0.02 \times 550,000 = 11,000
\]

**Realtor Fees:**  
Realtor fees are 5% of the selling price.  
\[
\text{Realtor Fees} = 0.05 \times 550,000 = 27,500
\]

**Total Selling Costs:**  
\[
\text{Total Selling Costs} = \text{Legal Fees} + \text{Realtor Fees} = 11,000 + 27,500 = 38,500
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Net Proceeds

**Remaining Loan Amount:** $440,000  
**Closing Costs:** $5,000  

**Total Costs:**  
\[
\text{Total Costs} = \text{Remaining Loan Amount} + \text{Closing Costs} + \text{Total Selling Costs} = 440,000 + 5,000 + 38,500 = 483,500
\]

**Net Proceeds from Sale:**  
\[
\text{Net Proceeds} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Total Costs} = 550,000 - 483,500 = 66,500
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Value of Investment in Stocks After Two Years

Dr. Brown invests the net proceeds of $66,500 in stocks that gain 10% each year.

**Year 1:**  
\[
\text{Value after Year 1} = \text{Initial Investment} \times (1 + \text{Rate}) = 66,500 \times (1 + 0.10) = 66,500 \times 1.10 = 73,150
\]

**Year 2:**  
\[
\text{Value after Year 2} = \text{Value after Year 1} \times (1 + \text{Rate}) = 73,150 \times (1 + 0.10) = 73,150 \times 1.10 = 80,465
\]

### Final Result

Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years of investing in stocks is **$80,465**.",80465.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the legal fees:**
   - The selling price of the villa is $550,000.
   - The legal fees are 2% of the selling price.
   - Legal fees = 0.02 * $550,000 = $11,000.

2. **Calculate the realtor fee:**
   - The realtor fee is 5% of the selling price.
   - Realtor fee = 0.05 * $550,000 = $27,500.

3. **Calculate the total fees paid:**
   - Total fees = Legal fees + Realtor fee = $11,000 + $27,500 = $38,500.

4. **Calculate the net proceeds from the sale:**
   - Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees - Remaining loan amount - Closing costs.
   - Remaining loan amount = $440,000.
   - Closing costs = $5,000.
   - Net proceeds = $550,000 - $38,500 - $440,000 - $5,000 = $66,500.

5. **Calculate the investment growth over two years:**
   - The stocks gain 10% each year.
   - After the first year, the value of the investment = $66,500 + (10% of $66,500) = $66,500 + $6,650 = $73,150.
   - After the second year, the value of the investment = $73,150 + (10% of $73,150) = $73,150 + $7,315 = $80,465.

An eighth of the tennis balls are indigo, and all except an eighth of those indigo balls are marked. How many marked balls are there in total?",16.0,"To find the total number of marked balls, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of balls**: The juggler can juggle 160 balls.

2. **Golf balls**: 
   - \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the balls are golf balls.
   - Number of golf balls = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 160 = 32 \).

3. **Tennis balls**: 
   - The rest of the balls are tennis balls.
   - Number of tennis balls = Total balls - Golf balls = \( 160 - 32 = 128 \).

4. **Marked golf balls**:
   - \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the golf balls are yellow.
   - Number of yellow golf balls = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 32 = 16 \).
   - \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the yellow golf balls are marked.
   - Number of marked yellow golf balls = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 16 = 2 \).

5. **Marked tennis balls**:
   - \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the tennis balls are indigo.
   - Number of indigo tennis balls = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 128 = 16 \).
   - All except \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the indigo balls are marked.
   - Number of unmarked indigo balls = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 16 = 2 \).
   - Therefore, the number of marked indigo balls = Total indigo balls - Unmarked indigo balls = \( 16 - 2 = 14 \).

6. **Total marked balls**:
   - Total marked balls = Marked yellow golf balls + Marked indigo tennis balls = \( 2 + 14 = 16 \).

Thus, the total number of marked balls is \( \boxed{16} \).",16.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. The juggler can juggle a total of 160 balls.
2. We need to find out how many of these are golf balls. According to the problem, 1/5 of the balls are golf balls:
   \[
   \text{Number of golf balls} = \frac{1}{5} \times 160 = 32
   \]
3. The rest of the balls are tennis balls. To find the number of tennis balls, we subtract the number of golf balls from the total:
   \[
   \text{Number of tennis balls} = 160 - 32 = 128
   \]

4. Next, we find out how many of the golf balls are yellow. It states that 1/2 of the golf balls are yellow:
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow golf balls} = \frac{1}{2} \times 32 = 16
   \]
5. Out of the yellow golf balls, 1/8 are marked:
   \[
   \text{Number of marked yellow golf balls} = \frac{1}{8} \times 16 = 2
   \]

6. Now, we need to find out how many of the tennis balls are indigo. It states that 1/8 of the tennis balls are indigo:
   \[
   \text{Number of indigo tennis balls} = \frac{1}{8} \times 128 = 16
   \]

7. The problem states that all except 1/8 of the indigo balls are marked. First, we find out how many are not marked:
   \[
   \text{Number of unmarked indigo balls} = \frac{1}{8} \times 16 = 2
   \]
   Therefore, the number of marked indigo balls is:
   \[
   \text{Number of marked indigo balls} = 16 - 2 = 14
   \]

8. Finally, we add the marked yellow golf balls and the marked indigo tennis balls to find the total number of marked balls:

If there are one-fourth the number of boys in the park, what percentage of the kids in the park are girls?",80.0,"To find the percentage of kids in the park that are girls, we first need to determine the number of boys in the park.

We know that there are 16 girls, and the number of boys is one-fourth the number of girls. Therefore, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Number of girls} = \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4
\]

Now, we can find the total number of kids in the park by adding the number of girls and boys:

\[
\text{Total number of kids} = \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of boys} = 16 + 4 = 20
\]

Next, we calculate the percentage of kids that are girls:

\[
\text{Percentage of girls} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of girls}}{\text{Total number of kids}} \right) \times 100

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Percentage of girls} = \left( \frac{16}{20} \right) \times 100

Calculating the fraction:

\[
\frac{16}{20} = 0.8
\]

Now, multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

\[
0.8 \times 100 = 80

Thus, the percentage of the kids in the park that are girls is:

\[
\boxed{80}
\]",80.0,1,"Let's think step by step.  
There are 16 girls in the park.  
The number of boys is one-fourth the number of girls.  
So, the number of boys is 16 / 4 = 4.  

Now, we can find the total number of kids in the park.  
Total kids = Number of girls + Number of boys = 16 + 4 = 20.  

Next, we need to find the percentage of kids in the park that are girls.  
The percentage of girls = (Number of girls / Total kids) * 100.  
So, the percentage of girls = (16 / 20) * 100 = 0.8 * 100 = 80%.

How much money does Priya have left?",492.0,"To find out how much money Priya has left after her purchases, we will calculate the total cost of each item she bought and then subtract that from the amount of money she started with.

1. **Cost of fudge:**
   - Priya bought 21 kgs of fudge.
   - The offer is ""Buy 15 kgs at ₺22 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/4 off.""
   - First, calculate the cost for the first 15 kgs:
     \[
     15 \text{ kgs} \times ₺22/\text{kg} = ₺330
     \]
   - Now, for the additional 6 kgs (21 kgs total - 15 kgs):

Yuki has 54 dogs, each having 13 puppies with spots. After a visit to the vet, Jamal discovered that half of his unspotted puppies actually have spots that were not visible before. What percentage of all the puppies have spots?",90.0,"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to calculate the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

1. **Calculate the total number of puppies:**
   - Jamal's dog has 131 puppies.
   - Gabriel's dog has 47 puppies.
   - Yuki has 54 dogs, each with 13 puppies, so:
     \[
     54 \times 13 = 702 \text{ puppies}
     \]
   - Now, we sum these numbers:
     \[
     131 + 47 + 702 = 880 \text{ total puppies}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of puppies with spots:**
   - Jamal's dog has 23 spotted puppies.
   - Gabriel's dog has 13 spotted puppies.
   - Yuki's dogs have:
     \[
     54 \times 13 = 702 \text{ puppies with spots}
     \]
   - Now, we sum these numbers:
     \[
     23 + 13 + 702 = 738 \text{ spotted puppies}
     \]

3. **Adjust for Jamal's unspotted puppies:**
   - Jamal has \( 131 - 23 = 108 \) unspotted puppies.
   - After the vet visit, half of these unspotted puppies are found to actually have spots:
     \[
     \frac{108}{2} = 54 \text{ additional spotted puppies}
     \]
   - Therefore, the new total of spotted puppies from Jamal is:
     \[
     23 + 54 = 77 \text{ spotted puppies}
     \]

4. **Recalculate the total number of spotted puppies:**
   - Now we add the newly calculated spotted puppies from Jamal to the previously calculated total:
     \[
     77 + 13 + 702 = 792 \text{ total spotted puppies}
     \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of puppies with spots:**
   - The percentage of puppies with spots is given by:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total spotted puppies}}{\text{Total puppies}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Plugging in the numbers:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{792}{880} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Calculating this gives:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = 0.9 \times 100 = 90\%
     \]

Thus, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is \( \boxed{90} \).",90.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of puppies for each person:**
   - Jamal's dog has 131 puppies.
   - Gabriel's dog has 47 puppies.
   - Yuki has 54 dogs, each with 13 puppies, so the total for Yuki is 54 * 13 = 702 puppies.

2. **Calculate the total number of puppies:**
   - Total puppies = Jamal's puppies + Gabriel's puppies + Yuki's puppies
   - Total puppies = 131 + 47 + 702 = 880 puppies.

3. **Calculate the number of spotted puppies:**
   - Jamal has 23 spotted puppies.
   - Gabriel has 13 spotted puppies.
   - Yuki has 54 dogs, each with 13 spotted puppies, so the total for Yuki is 54 * 13 = 702 spotted puppies.
   - Total spotted puppies = Jamal's spotted + Gabriel's spotted + Yuki's spotted
   - Total spotted puppies = 23 + 13 + 702 = 738 spotted puppies.

4. **Calculate the number of unspotted puppies for Jamal:**
   - Jamal's unspotted puppies = Total puppies - Spotted puppies
   - Jamal's unspotted puppies = 131 - 23 = 108 unspotted puppies.

5. **Determine how many of Jamal's unspotted puppies actually have spots:**
   - Half of Jamal's unspotted puppies have spots: 108 / 2 = 54 puppies.

6. **Calculate the new total of spotted puppies:**
   - New total spotted puppies = Original spotted puppies + Newly discovered spotted puppies
   - New total spotted puppies = 738 + 54 = 792 spotted puppies.

7. **Calculate the percentage of puppies that have spots:**
   - Percentage of spotted puppies = (Total spotted puppies / Total puppies) * 100
   - Percentage of spotted puppies = (792 / 880) * 100 ≈ 90%.

Explanation:
I miscalculated the total weight of the items. I added the weights incorrectly and did not account for all the items properly.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Addition error
- Incorrect total weight

Instructions:
1. Identify all items and their respective weights.
2. Calculate the total weight of each type of item.
3. Sum all the weights to find the total weight.
4. Divide the total weight by the carrying capacity of the wheelbarrow to find the number of trips needed.

Question: A farmer is buying feed for his pigs. He buys a variety of hay, corn, cucumbers and apples. Since apples are a rare treat, he only buys four 3-kg boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys twelve 6-kg bags. Hay are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys thirty four 39-kg packs. Corn are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 17-kg sacks. Finally, he buys 43 kgs of groceries, and 27 kgs of tools, and 100 kgs of wood. A farm truck can carry 160 kgs at a time. If the farmer has three trucks, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the purchased items?

Reflection 1: 12.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I miscalculated the total weight of the items. I did not account for all the weights properly and made an error in my addition, leading to an incorrect total weight. Additionally, I failed to consider the number of trucks available when calculating the number of trips.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Addition error
- Incorrect total weight
- Ignored multiple trucks

### Solution:
1. **Identify all items and their respective weights:**
   - Apples: 4 boxes * 3 kg = 12 kg
   - Cucumbers: 12 bags * 6 kg = 72 kg
   - Hay: 34 packs * 39 kg = 1326 kg
   - Corn: 20 sacks * 17 kg = 340 kg
   - Groceries: 43 kg
   - Tools: 27 kg
   - Wood: 100 kg

2. **Calculate the total weight of each type of item:**
   - Apples: 12 kg
   - Cucumbers: 72 kg
   - Hay: 1326 kg
   - Corn: 340 kg
   - Groceries: 43 kg
   - Tools: 27 kg
   - Wood: 100 kg

3. **Sum all the weights to find the total weight:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 12 + 72 + 1326 + 340 + 43 + 27 + 100 = 1920 \text{ kg}
   \]

4. **Determine the carrying capacity of the trucks:**
   - Each truck can carry 160 kg.
   - The farmer has 3 trucks, so the total carrying capacity is:
   \[
   3 \text{ trucks} \times 160 \text{ kg/truck} = 480 \text{ kg}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of trips needed:**
   \[
   \text{Number of trips} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Total carrying capacity}} = \frac{1920 \text{ kg}}{480 \text{ kg}} = 4
   \]

### Final Answer:
The farmer needs to make **4 trips** to transport all the purchased items.

### Instructions:
1. Identify all items and their weights.
2. Calculate the total weight for each type of item.
3. Sum all weights to find the total weight.
4. Determine the total carrying capacity based on the number of trucks and their individual capacity.
5. Divide the total weight by the total carrying capacity to find the number of trips needed.
6. Round up to the nearest whole number if necessary.

### General Advice:
- Always double-check your addition to ensure all items are included.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion.
- Remember to consider all resources available (like multiple trucks) when calculating capacity.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Uma saw a 40-foot shark with 18 remoras, each 16 inches long attached to it. Then, 1/6 of the remoras swam away. Later, Uma saw another 10-foot shark with 6 remoras, each 8 inches long, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?",45.0,"To find the average percentage of each shark's body length that is covered by the remoras, we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert the lengths of the remoras from inches to feet.**
2. **Calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each shark.**
3. **Determine how many remoras are left after some swim away.**
4. **Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that is covered by the remoras.**
5. **Find the average percentage for both sharks.**

### Step 1: Convert the lengths of the remoras to feet

- For the first shark, each remora is 16 inches long. 
  \[
  16 \text{ inches} = \frac{16}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 1.33 \text{ feet}
  \]

- For the second shark, each remora is 8 inches long.
  \[
  8 \text{ inches} = \frac{8}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 0.67 \text{ feet}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each shark

- For the first shark (40-foot shark with 18 remoras):
  \[
  \text{Total length of remoras} = 18 \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ feet} = 18 \times 1.33 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
  \]

- For the second shark (10-foot shark with 6 remoras):
  \[
  \text{Total length of remoras} = 6 \times \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} = 6 \times 0.67 \text{ feet} = 4 \text{ feet}
  \]

### Step 3: Determine how many remoras are left after some swim away

- For the first shark, \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the remoras swam away:
  \[
  \text{Remoras that swam away} = \frac{1}{6} \times 18 = 3
  \]
  \[
  \text{Remaining remoras} = 18 - 3 = 15
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total length of remaining remoras} = 15 \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ feet} = 15 \times 1.33 \text{ feet} = 20 \text{ feet}
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that is covered by the remoras

- For the first shark:
  \[
  \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{40 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 50\%
  \]

- For the second shark:
  \[
  \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{4 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 40\%
  \]

### Step 5: Find the average percentage for both sharks

\[
\text{Average percentage} = \frac{50\% + 40\%}{2} = \frac{90\%}{2} = 45\%
\]

Thus, the average percentage of each shark's body length that is covered by the remoras is **45%**.",45.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total length of the remoras on the first shark:**
   - There are 18 remoras, each 16 inches long.
   - Total length of remoras = 18 * 16 = 288 inches.

2. **Convert the shark's length from feet to inches:**
   - The first shark is 40 feet long.
   - 1 foot = 12 inches, so 40 feet = 40 * 12 = 480 inches.

3. **Calculate the percentage of the first shark's body length covered by the remoras:**
   - Percentage = (Total length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100
   - Percentage for the first shark = (288 / 480) * 100 = 60%.

4. **Calculate how many remoras swam away:**
   - 1/6 of the 18 remoras swam away.
   - Number of remoras that swam away = 18 / 6 = 3.
   - Remaining remoras = 18 - 3 = 15.

5. **Calculate the total length of the remaining remoras:**
   - Remaining remoras = 15, each 16 inches long.
   - Total length of remaining remoras = 15 * 16 = 240 inches.

6. **Calculate the percentage of the first shark's body length covered by the remaining remoras:**
   - Percentage for the remaining remoras = (240 / 480) * 100 = 50%.

7. **Now, calculate the total length of the remoras on the second shark:**
   - There are 6 remoras, each 8 inches long.
   - Total length of remoras = 6 * 8 = 48 inches.

8. **Convert the second shark's length from feet to inches:**
   - The second shark is 10 feet long.
   - 10 feet = 10 * 12 = 120 inches.

9. **Calculate the percentage of the second shark's body length covered by the remoras:**
   - Percentage for the second shark = (48 / 120) * 100 = 40%.

10. **Calculate the average percentage of both sharks' body lengths covered by the remoras:**
    - Average percentage = (Percentage of first shark + Percentage of second shark) / 2
    - Average percentage = (60 + 40) / 2 = 50%.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Carlos places almonds on bowls and tables. Each bowl can hold 24 almonds while each table can hold three times that. Carlos has 720 almonds, 7 bowls and 3 tables. Unfortunately, 2 tables break. Carlos then eats one-fifth of all the almonds. How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?",14.0,"To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the capacity of the bowls and tables.**
   - Each bowl can hold 24 almonds.
   - Each table can hold three times that, which is \(3 \times 24 = 72\) almonds.

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and tables before any tables break.**
   - Carlos has 7 bowls, so the total capacity of the bowls is:
     \[
     7 \text{ bowls} \times 24 \text{ almonds/bowl} = 168 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - Carlos has 3 tables, so the total capacity of the tables is:
     \[
     3 \text{ tables} \times 72 \text{ almonds/table} = 216 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total capacity of all bowls and tables combined is:
     \[
     168 \text{ almonds} + 216 \text{ almonds} = 384 \text{ almonds}
     \]

3. **Account for the broken tables.**
   - After 2 tables break, Carlos has:
     \[
     3 - 2 = 1 \text{ table}
     \]
   - The capacity of the remaining table is:
     \[
     1 \text{ table} \times 72 \text{ almonds/table} = 72 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - The total capacity with the remaining bowls and the one table is:
     \[
     168 \text{ almonds (bowls)} + 72 \text{ almonds (1 table)} = 240 \text{ almonds}
     \]

4. **Calculate how many almonds Carlos has after eating some.**
   - Carlos starts with 720 almonds and eats one-fifth of them:
     \[
     \text{Almonds eaten} = \frac{1}{5} \times 720 = 144 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - The remaining almonds are:
     \[
     720 - 144 = 576 \text{ almonds}
     \]

5. **Determine how many more bowls are needed to hold the remaining almonds.**
   - The total capacity of the bowls and the remaining table is 240 almonds, but Carlos has 576 almonds left.
   - The number of additional bowls needed can be calculated as follows:
     - First, find out how many bowls are needed to hold 576 almonds:
     \[
     \text{Bowls needed} = \frac{576 \text{ almonds}}{24 \text{ almonds/bowl}} = 24 \text{ bowls}
     \]
   - Carlos currently has 7 bowls, so the number of additional bowls needed is:
     \[
     24 \text{ bowls} - 7 \text{ bowls} = 17 \text{ bowls}
     \]

Thus, Carlos needs **17 more bowls** to place all the remaining almonds.",17.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the capacity of the tables**: 
   Each bowl can hold 24 almonds. 
   Each table can hold three times that, so:
   \[
   \text{Capacity of each table} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ almonds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and tables**:
   Carlos has 7 bowls and 3 tables, but 2 tables break, leaving him with:
   \[
   \text{Remaining tables} = 3 - 2 = 1 \text{ table}
   \]
   Now, we calculate the total capacity:
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of bowls} = 7 \times 24 = 168 \text{ almonds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of remaining table} = 1 \times 72 = 72 \text{ almonds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = 168 + 72 = 240 \text{ almonds}
   \]

3. **Determine how many almonds Carlos has left after eating**:
   Carlos starts with 720 almonds. He eats one-fifth of them:
   \[
   \text{Almonds eaten} = \frac{1}{5} \times 720 = 144 \text{ almonds}
   \]
   So, the remaining almonds are:
   \[
   \text{Remaining almonds} = 720 - 144 = 576 \text{ almonds}
   \]

4. **Determine if the current capacity is enough**:
   The total capacity of the bowls and the remaining table is 240 almonds, but Carlos has 576 almonds. 
   Since 576 > 240, he does not have enough capacity.

5. **Calculate how many more bowls are needed**:
   First, we find out how many more almonds need to be accommodated:
   \[
   \text{Additional almonds needed} = 576 - 240 = 336 \text{ almonds}
   \]
   Each bowl holds 24 almonds, so the number of additional bowls needed is:
   \[
   \text{Additional bowls needed} = \frac{336}{24} = 14 \text{ bowls}
   \]

What will be the average of all four in 4 years?",25.0,"To solve the problem, we will first determine the ages of Diego, Aisha, Esteban, and Nadia at the relevant times, and then calculate the average of their ages in 4 years.

1. **Diego's current age**: 
   - Diego is currently 19 years old.

2. **Aisha's age in 9 years**: 
   - In 9 years, Diego will be \(19 + 9 = 28\) years old.
   - According to the problem, Aisha will be 2 times Diego's current age in 9 years. Diego's current age is 19, so Aisha will be \(2 \times 19 = 38\) years old in 9 years.

3. **Aisha's current age**: 
   - Since Aisha will be 38 in 9 years, her current age is \(38 - 9 = 29\) years old.

4. **Esteban's age**: 
   - Esteban is 6 years younger than Diego. Therefore, Esteban's current age is \(19 - 6 = 13\) years old.

5. **Nadia's age**: 
   - Nadia is 10 years older than Esteban. Thus, Nadia's current age is \(13 + 10 = 23\) years old.

Now we have the current ages of all four individuals:
- Diego: 19 years
- Aisha: 29 years
- Esteban: 13 years
- Nadia: 23 years

6. **Ages in 4 years**: 
   - Diego in 4 years: \(19 + 4 = 23\)
   - Aisha in 4 years: \(29 + 4 = 33\)
   - Esteban in 4 years: \(13 + 4 = 17\)
   - Nadia in 4 years: \(23 + 4 = 27\)

7. **Calculating the average age in 4 years**:
   - First, we sum their ages in 4 years:
     \[
     23 + 33 + 17 + 27 = 100
     \]
   - Now, we divide by the number of individuals (4):
     \[
     \text{Average age} = \frac{100}{4} = 25
     \]

Thus, the average age of Diego, Aisha, Esteban, and Nadia in 4 years will be **25 years**.",25.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Diego's current age**: Diego is 19 years old.

2. **Aisha's age in 9 years**: We need to find out how old Aisha will be in 9 years. According to the problem, in 9 years, Aisha will be 2 times as old as Diego is now. 
   - Diego's current age is 19, so in 9 years, Aisha will be: 
   \[
   2 \times 19 = 38 \text{ years old.}
   \]

3. **Diego's brother Esteban's age**: Esteban is 6 years younger than Diego.
   - So, Esteban's current age is:
   \[
   19 - 6 = 13 \text{ years old.}
   \]

4. **Nadia's age**: Nadia is 10 years older than Esteban.
   - So, Nadia's current age is:
   \[
   13 + 10 = 23 \text{ years old.}
   \]

5. **Ages in 4 years**: Now we will calculate the ages of Diego, Aisha, Esteban, and Nadia in 4 years.
   - Diego's age in 4 years: 
   \[
   19 + 4 = 23 \text{ years old.}
   \]
   - Aisha's age in 4 years: 
   \[
   38 + 4 = 42 \text{ years old.}
   \]
   - Esteban's age in 4 years: 
   \[
   13 + 4 = 17 \text{ years old.}
   \]
   - Nadia's age in 4 years: 
   \[
   23 + 4 = 27 \text{ years old.}
   \]

6. **Calculating the average age**: Now we will find the average of their ages in 4 years.
   - The total age of all four in 4 years is:
   \[
   23 + 42 + 17 + 27 = 109.
   \]
   - The average age is:
   \[
   \frac{109}{4} = 27.25.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the ages of the individuals involved and misinterpreted the relationships between their ages. Specifically, I failed to correctly account for the time frames and the relationships when determining Aisha's age based on Diego's current age.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Age relationships
- Time frame misunderstanding
- Incorrect assumptions

### Solution:
1. **Identify Current Ages:**
   - Diego is currently 19 years old.
   - Esteban is 6 years younger than Diego, so Esteban is 19 - 6 = 13 years old.
   - Aisha will be 2 times Diego's current age in 9 years. Therefore, Aisha's age in 9 years will be 2 * 19 = 38 years.
   - To find Aisha's current age, we subtract 9 years from her future age: 38 - 9 = 29 years old.
   - Nadia is 10 years older than Esteban, so Nadia's current age is 13 + 10 = 23 years old.

2. **Calculate Ages in 4 Years:**
   - Diego in 4 years: 19 + 4 = 23 years old.
   - Esteban in 4 years: 13 + 4 = 17 years old.
   - Aisha in 4 years: 29 + 4 = 33 years old.
   - Nadia in 4 years: 23 + 4 = 27 years old.

3. **Total Age Calculation:**
   - Total age in 4 years = 23 (Diego) + 17 (Esteban) + 33 (Aisha) + 27 (Nadia) = 100 years.

4. **Average Age Calculation:**
   - Average age = Total age / Number of individuals = 100 / 4 = 25 years.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Keisha is knitting winter wear for her 4 grandchildren. They're quadruplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a shawl, sweater, poncho, gloves, and mittens for each of them. It takes 5 skeins of wool to make a shawl, 6 for a sweater, 8 for a poncho, 8 for a pair of gloves, and 14 for a pair of mittens. Keisha wants to make two warm jackets for herself, each needing 8 skeins of wool. Each dozen skeins of wool costs $7. The store has a promotion where customers receive a $20 discount on purchases over $100. How much should Keisha pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?",85.0,"To find out how much Keisha should pay for all the skeins of wool she needs, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed for the grandchildren's items.**
   - Shawl: 5 skeins
   - Sweater: 6 skeins
   - Poncho: 8 skeins
   - Gloves: 8 skeins
   - Mittens: 14 skeins

   Total skeins for one grandchild:
   \[
   5 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 14 = 41 \text{ skeins}
   \]

   Since there are 4 grandchildren:
   \[
   41 \times 4 = 164 \text{ skeins}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed for Keisha's jackets.**
   - Each jacket requires 8 skeins, and she wants to make 2 jackets:
   \[
   8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ skeins}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed for both grandchildren and Keisha.**
   \[
   164 + 16 = 180 \text{ skeins}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the skeins of wool.**
   - Each dozen skeins costs $7. First, we need to find out how many dozens are in 180 skeins:
   \[
   \frac{180}{12} = 15 \text{ dozens}
   \]

   Now, calculate the cost:
   \[
   15 \times 7 = 105 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Apply the discount if applicable.**
   Since the total cost of $105 is over $100, Keisha qualifies for a $20 discount:
   \[
   105 - 20 = 85 \text{ dollars}

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,Mohammed goes to the store to buy some rice. The normal brand of rice he buys costs ¥15 per kg. He has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 3 kgs of rice per day. The store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs; any additional rice is sold at the regular price. Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2. How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,"To find out how much Mohammed has to pay, we can break down the problem into several steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of rice Mohammed needs for a week:**
   - Mohammed uses 3 kg of rice per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he needs:
     \[
     3 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 21 \, \text{kg}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost of the more expensive brand of rice:**
   - The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg.
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } ¥15 = 0.20 \times 15 = ¥3
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of the more expensive brand is:
     \[
     ¥15 + ¥3 = ¥18 \, \text{per kg}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the first 10 kg of rice with the discount:**
   - The store has a 40% discount on rice up to 10 kg.
   - The discount amount on ¥18 is:
     \[
     40\% \text{ of } ¥18 = 0.40 \times 18 = ¥7.2
     \]
   - The discounted price per kg is:
     \[
     ¥18 - ¥7.2 = ¥10.8
     \]
   - The cost for the first 10 kg is:
     \[
     10 \, \text{kg} \times ¥10.8 = ¥108
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the remaining rice (11 kg) at regular price:**
   - The remaining amount of rice is:
     \[
     21 \, \text{kg} - 10 \, \text{kg} = 11 \, \text{kg}

6. **Add the cost of the bagel:**
   - The cost of the bagel is ¥2.
   - Therefore, the total amount Mohammed has to pay is:
     \[
     ¥306 + ¥2 = ¥308
     \]

Thus, the total amount Mohammed has to pay is **¥308**.",308.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice:**
   - The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg.
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more.
   - 20% of ¥15 is \( 0.20 \times 15 = ¥3 \).
   - Therefore, the cost of the more expensive brand is \( 15 + 3 = ¥18 \) per kg.

2. **Calculate the total amount of rice Mohammed needs for a week:**
   - Mohammed uses 3 kgs of rice per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he needs \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) kgs of rice.

3. **Calculate the cost of the first 10 kgs of rice with the discount:**
   - The store has a 40% discount on the first 10 kgs.
   - The price after the discount for the first 10 kgs is \( 18 \times 0.60 = ¥10.80 \) per kg.
   - Therefore, the cost for 10 kgs is \( 10 \times 10.80 = ¥108 \).

4. **Calculate the cost of the remaining rice:**
   - Mohammed needs a total of 21 kgs, so he needs an additional \( 21 - 10 = 11 \) kgs.
   - The cost for these 11 kgs at the regular price is \( 11 \times 18 = ¥198 \).

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Jasmine and Mia are sisters from Nairobi who love collecting signatures from authors. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Jasmine and Mia compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Jasmine has 36 signatures in her book, and Mia has 31. The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,"To find out how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week to reach their goal of 145 signatures, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total signatures collected so far:**
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   - Mia has 31 signatures.
   - Total signatures collected = 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

2. **Determine the remaining signatures needed to reach the goal:**
   - Goal = 145 signatures.
   - Remaining signatures needed = 145 - 67 = 78 signatures.

3. **Determine Jasmine's collection over the next 2 weeks:**
   - Jasmine's current weekly collection is not explicitly given, but we know that she will collect 5 signatures less per week than she normally would.
   - Let's denote Jasmine's normal weekly collection as \( J \).
   - In the next 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect signatures only on weekends, which means she will collect \( J - 5 \) signatures each week.
   - Therefore, over 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect \( 2(J - 5) = 2J - 10 \) signatures.

4. **Calculate Mia's required collection:**
   - Let \( M \) be the number of signatures Mia collects per week.
   - Over the next 2 weeks, Mia will collect \( 2M \) signatures.
   - The total signatures collected by both sisters over the next 2 weeks will be:
     \[
     (2J - 10) + 2M
     \]
   - We want this total to equal the remaining signatures needed (78):
     \[
     (2J - 10) + 2M = 78
     \]

5. **Rearranging the equation:**
   - Rearranging gives us:
     \[
     2M = 78 - (2J - 10)
     \]
     \[
     2M = 78 - 2J + 10
     \]
     \[
     2M = 88 - 2J
     \]
     \[
     M = 44 - J
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Mia needs to collect \( 44 - J \) signatures per week, where \( J \) is Jasmine's normal weekly collection. Since we do not have the exact value of \( J \), we can express Mia's required collection in terms of \( J \).

If we assume Jasmine's normal weekly collection \( J \) is known, we can substitute that value into the equation \( M = 44 - J \) to find the exact number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week. 

For example, if Jasmine normally collects 20 signatures per week, then:
\[
M = 44 - 20 = 24
\]
Mia would need to collect 24 signatures per week. 

Without the specific value of \( J \), we can only express Mia's required collection in terms of \( J \).",24.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Current Signatures**: 
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   - Mia has 31 signatures.
   - So, the total number of signatures they currently have is 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

2. **Goal**: 
   - They want to reach a total of 145 signatures by the end of the break.

3. **Signatures Needed**: 
   - To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the current total from their goal:
   - 145 - 67 = 78 signatures needed.

4. **Remaining Time**: 
   - They have 2 more weeks of spring break.

5. **Jasmine's Collection**: 
   - Jasmine can only collect signatures on weekends, which means she will collect fewer signatures per week. 
   - Normally, if she collected X signatures per week, now she collects (X - 5) signatures per week.
   - Over 2 weeks, she will collect 2 * (X - 5) signatures.

6. **Mia's Collection**: 
   - Let’s denote the number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week as Y.
   - Over 2 weeks, Mia will collect 2 * Y signatures.

7. **Total Signatures Collected in 2 Weeks**: 
   - The total signatures collected by both sisters in the remaining 2 weeks will be:
   - Total = 2 * (X - 5) + 2 * Y.

8. **Setting Up the Equation**: 
   - We know they need to collect 78 more signatures, so we set up the equation:
   - 2 * (X - 5) + 2 * Y = 78.

9. **Simplifying the Equation**: 
   - We can factor out the 2:
   - 2 * [(X - 5) + Y] = 78.
   - Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:
   - (X - 5) + Y = 39.

10. **Finding Y**: 
    - Rearranging the equation gives us:
    - Y = 39 - (X - 5).
    - Simplifying further:
    - Y = 39 - X + 5,
    - Y = 44 - X.

11. **Conclusion**: 
    - Mia needs to collect (44 - X) signatures per week, where X is the number of signatures Jasmine would normally collect per week.

Since we don't have the exact value of X, we can conclude that Mia's required collection rate depends on Jasmine's usual collection rate. If we know how many signatures Jasmine usually collects per week, we can find the exact number Mia needs to collect. 

The answer is Mia needs to collect (44 - X) signatures per week, where X is Jasmine's usual weekly collection.",44.0,0,1,0,29.0,"--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

[Example Input]
Question: Alex and Jamie are friends who enjoy playing video games. After 4 weeks of summer vacation, they decide to compare their scores. Alex has scored 80 points, while Jamie has scored 70 points. They have 3 more weeks to play, and they want to reach a total of 300 points together by the end of the vacation. However, during the remaining weeks, Alex can only score 10 points per week, while Jamie plans to increase her score to 20 points per week. How many points will Jamie need to score each week to ensure they reach their goal?

Wrong answer: I calculated that Jamie needs to score 30 points per week, but I forgot to account for the points Alex would score in the remaining weeks.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total points Alex would score in the remaining weeks, which led me to incorrectly determine how many points Jamie needed to score.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect assumptions
- Failure to account for contributions

Instructions:
1. Identify the current scores of both individuals.
2. Determine the total points needed to reach the goal.
3. Calculate how many points have already been scored.
4. Assess how many points each individual can score in the remaining time.
5. Set up an equation to find out how many points Jamie needs to score per week.
6. Solve the equation step-by-step.

Advice:
- Always double-check the contributions of all parties involved in the problem.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid missing details.
- Write down all known values and what needs to be found before starting calculations.

Solution:
Alex has 80 points and can score 10 points per week for 3 weeks, totaling 30 points. Therefore, Alex will have 110 points. They need 300 points total, so they need 190 more points. Jamie needs to score 190 points in 3 weeks, which means she needs to score approximately 63.33 points per week. Since this is not feasible, I need to adjust my calculations to ensure I find a realistic weekly score for Jamie based on the constraints given.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Jasmine and Mia are sisters from Nairobi who love collecting signatures from authors. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Jasmine and Mia compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Jasmine has 36 signatures in her book, and Mia has 31. The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 44.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the number of signatures Mia needed to collect per week because I did not properly account for the total signatures Jasmine would collect in the remaining weeks. I also miscalculated the total number of signatures needed after considering their current totals.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect assumptions
- Failure to account for contributions

### Solution:
1. **Identify Current Signatures:**
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   - Mia has 31 signatures.

2. **Calculate Total Signatures Already Collected:**
   - Total signatures = Jasmine's signatures + Mia's signatures = 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

3. **Determine Total Signatures Needed:**
   - They want to reach a total of 145 signatures.

4. **Calculate Remaining Signatures Needed:**
   - Remaining signatures needed = Total signatures needed - Total signatures already collected = 145 - 67 = 78 signatures.

5. **Assess Jasmine's Collection:**
   - Jasmine can collect signatures for 2 more weeks but is limited to weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 signatures.
   - Let's assume Jasmine originally collected \( x \) signatures per week. Therefore, her new collection per week is \( x - 5 \).
   - In 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect \( 2(x - 5) \).

6. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Mia's collection per week will be \( y \).
   - In 2 weeks, Mia will collect \( 2y \).
   - The total signatures collected by both in the remaining weeks should equal the remaining signatures needed:
   \[
   2(x - 5) + 2y = 78
   \]

7. **Assume Jasmine's Original Weekly Collection:**
   - If we assume Jasmine originally collected 15 signatures per week (as an example), then:
   \[
   2(15 - 5) + 2y = 78
   \]
   \[
   2(10) + 2y = 78
   \]
   \[
   20 + 2y = 78
   \]
   \[
   2y = 78 - 20
   \]
   \[
   2y = 58
   \]
   \[
   y = 29
   \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   - Mia needs to collect **29 signatures per week** to ensure they reach their goal of 145 signatures.

### Instructions for Future Problems:
1. Identify the current totals for each individual involved.
2. Determine the overall goal and how many signatures have already been collected.
3. Calculate how many more signatures are needed to reach the goal.
4. Assess the collection capabilities of each individual for the remaining time.
5. Set up an equation that incorporates the contributions of all individuals.
6. Solve the equation step-by-step, ensuring all variables are accounted for.

### General Advice for Similar Problems:
- Always verify the contributions of all parties involved before finalizing calculations.
- Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts to avoid overlooking details.
- Clearly define all variables and their relationships before setting up equations.
- Double-check calculations to ensure accuracy and consistency with the problem's requirements.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

They have 3 more weeks of vacation, and they want to reach a total of 300 points together by the end of the vacation. However, during the remaining weeks, Alex can only score 10 points less each week due to a new game distraction, while Jamie plans to increase her score by 15 points each week. How many points will Jamie need to score each week to ensure they reach their goal?

Wrong answer: I calculated that Jamie needs to score 30 points each week. I mistakenly added Alex's current score to the total goal and then divided by the number of weeks without considering Alex's reduced scoring.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total points needed by not accounting for Alex's reduced scoring and incorrectly divided the remaining points by the number of weeks without adjusting for Alex's contribution.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect division
- Ignoring variable changes

Instructions:
1. Identify the current scores of both individuals.
2. Determine the total score needed to reach the goal.
3. Calculate the total points already scored.
4. Find the remaining points needed by subtracting the current total from the goal.
5. Account for any changes in scoring for each individual over the remaining weeks.
6. Set up an equation to find the required score for the individual who is increasing their score.
7. Solve the equation step-by-step.

Advice:
- Always double-check the current scores and the goal.
- Pay attention to any changes in scoring rates and how they affect the total.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion.
- Use clear variables to represent each person's score and changes over time.

Solution:
Alex has 80 points and will score 10 points less each week, so he will score 10 points in the first week and 10 points in the second week, totaling 20 points. Jamie needs to score enough to reach the goal of 300 points. The total points needed is 300 - (80 + 70 + 20) = 130 points. Jamie has 3 weeks to score 130 points, so she needs to score 130 / 3 = approximately 43.33 points per week. Since she can only score whole points, she needs to score at least 44 points each week to ensure they reach their goal.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I miscalculated the total number of signatures needed by not properly accounting for Jasmine's reduced collection rate and incorrectly assumed Mia's collection without setting up the correct equation. I also failed to consider the total signatures already collected by both sisters when calculating how many more signatures they needed.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect assumptions
- Ignoring variable changes

### Solution:
1. **Identify Current Scores**: 
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   - Mia has 31 signatures.

2. **Determine Total Goal**: 
   - They want to reach a total of 145 signatures.

3. **Calculate Total Already Collected**: 
   - Total signatures collected = 36 (Jasmine) + 31 (Mia) = 67 signatures.

4. **Find Remaining Signatures Needed**: 
   - Remaining signatures needed = 145 (goal) - 67 (current total) = 78 signatures.

5. **Account for Changes in Scoring**:
   - Jasmine can only collect signatures on weekends, reducing her collection by 5 signatures per week. 
   - In 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect: 
     - Week 1: 36 - 5 = 31 signatures
     - Week 2: 31 - 5 = 26 signatures
     - Total for Jasmine = 31 + 26 = 57 signatures.

6. **Calculate Mia's Required Collection**:
   - Mia needs to collect enough signatures to make up the remaining total. 
   - Total signatures needed from Mia = 78 (remaining) - 57 (Jasmine's total) = 21 signatures.

7. **Determine Mia's Weekly Collection**:
   - Mia has 2 weeks to collect 21 signatures, so she needs to collect:
     - 21 signatures / 2 weeks = 10.5 signatures per week.
   - Since she can only collect whole signatures, Mia needs to collect at least 11 signatures per week to ensure they reach their goal.

### Instructions:
1. Identify the current scores of both individuals.
2. Determine the total score needed to reach the goal.
3. Calculate the total points already scored.
4. Find the remaining points needed by subtracting the current total from the goal.
5. Account for any changes in scoring for each individual over the remaining weeks.
6. Set up an equation to find the required score for the individual who is increasing their score.
7. Solve the equation step-by-step, ensuring to round up if necessary for whole numbers.

### Advice:
- Always double-check the current scores and the goal.
- Pay attention to any changes in scoring rates and how they affect the total.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion.
- Use clear variables to represent each person's score and changes over time.
- Remember to round up when dealing with quantities that cannot be fractional (like signatures).","--- Beginning of the template ---

I answered the question incorrectly because I miscalculated the total number of signatures needed and did not properly account for Jasmine's reduced collection rate. I also failed to set up the equation correctly to find Mia's required weekly collection.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation of total signatures needed
- Incorrect equation setup
- Neglecting individual collection rates

### Solution:
1. **Identify Current Signatures:**
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   - Mia has 31 signatures.
   - Total signatures currently = 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

2. **Determine Total Goal:**
   - They want to reach a total of 145 signatures.

3. **Calculate Remaining Signatures Needed:**
   - Remaining signatures needed = 145 - 67 = 78 signatures.

4. **Account for Jasmine's Reduced Collection:**
   - Jasmine can only collect signatures on weekends, reducing her collection by 5 signatures per week.
   - If she normally collects \( x \) signatures per week, she will now collect \( x - 5 \) signatures per week.
   - In 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect \( 2(x - 5) \) signatures.

5. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let Mia's required weekly collection be \( y \).
   - In 2 weeks, Mia will collect \( 2y \) signatures.
   - The total signatures collected by both sisters in 2 weeks must equal the remaining signatures needed:
   \[
   2(x - 5) + 2y = 78
   \]

6. **Assuming Jasmine's Normal Collection Rate:**
   - If we assume Jasmine normally collects 20 signatures per week (for example), then:
   \[
   2(20 - 5) + 2y = 78
   \]
   \[
   2(15) + 2y = 78
   \]
   \[
   30 + 2y = 78
   \]
   \[
   2y = 78 - 30
   \]
   \[
   2y = 48
   \]
   \[
   y = 24
   \]

7. **Final Calculation:**
   - Mia needs to collect **24 signatures per week** to ensure they reach their goal.

### Instructions:
1. Identify the current totals for each individual.
2. Determine the total goal signature count.
3. Calculate how many signatures are needed to reach the goal.
4. Assess any changes in collection rates for each individual.
5. Set up an equation that incorporates both individuals' contributions.
6. Solve the equation step-by-step to find the required collection rate for the individual who can increase their collection.

### General Advice:
- Always verify the current totals before calculating the remaining needed amounts.

[Example Input]
Question: Alex and Jamie are friends who enjoy playing video games. After 4 weeks of summer vacation, they decide to compare their scores. Alex has scored 80 points, while Jamie has scored 70 points. They have 3 more weeks to play, and they want to reach a total of 300 points together by the end of the vacation. However, Alex can only score 10 points less per week due to a new game distraction, while Jamie plans to increase her score by 15 points per week. How many points does Jamie need to score each week to ensure they reach their goal?

Wrong answer: I calculated that Jamie needs to score 30 points per week. I mistakenly added their current scores and subtracted from 300 without considering Alex's reduced scoring.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total points needed by not accounting for Alex's reduced scoring and only focusing on the total goal. I also failed to set up the equation correctly to find Jamie's required weekly score.

Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding of total goals
- Incorrect equation setup
- Neglecting individual contributions

Instructions:
1. Identify the current scores of both individuals.
2. Determine the total goal score.
3. Calculate the total points already scored.
4. Find the remaining points needed to reach the goal.
5. Account for any changes in scoring for each individual.
6. Set up an equation to find the required score for the individual who can increase their score.
7. Solve the equation step-by-step.

Advice:
- Always double-check the contributions of each individual in a problem.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion.
- Write down the equations clearly to visualize the relationships between the variables.
- Review the problem to ensure all conditions are considered before solving.

Solution:
Alex has 80 points and Jamie has 70 points, totaling 150 points. They need 300 - 150 = 150 more points. In 3 weeks, Alex will score 10 points less per week, so he will score 10 points per week, totaling 30 points. Therefore, Jamie needs to score 150 - 30 = 120 points in 3 weeks, which means she needs to score 120 / 3 = 40 points per week.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Jasmine and Mia are sisters from Nairobi who love collecting signatures from authors. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Jasmine and Mia compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Jasmine has 36 signatures in her book, and Mia has 31. The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

It takes them 16 minutes to get to the corner where the cinema is. It takes them another 52 minutes to get to the gym. When they reach the gym, they remember they forgot their wallets at home, so they have to return to pick up their wallets and then walk all the way back to the gym again. Once they reach the gym for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the mall without being late?",42.0,"To find out how much longer Sofia and Benjamin have to get to the mall after returning to the gym, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Time to the cinema**: 16 minutes
2. **Time from the cinema to the gym**: 52 minutes

   So, the total time to reach the gym for the first time is:
   \[
   16 \text{ minutes} + 52 \text{ minutes} = 68 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Time to return home from the gym**: Since it takes the same amount of time to return, it will also take them 68 minutes to go back home.

4. **Time to walk back to the gym**: Again, it will take them another 68 minutes to walk back to the gym.

5. **Total time spent so far**:
   \[
   68 \text{ minutes (to gym)} + 68 \text{ minutes (back home)} + 68 \text{ minutes (back to gym)} = 204 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Total time available**: They have 246 minutes in total.

7. **Time remaining after reaching the gym for the second time**:
   \[
   246 \text{ minutes} - 204 \text{ minutes} = 42 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, after reaching the gym for the second time, Sofia and Benjamin have **42 minutes** left to get to the mall without being late.",42.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Sofia and Benjamin have a total of 246 minutes to walk to the mall.
2. It takes them 16 minutes to get to the corner where the cinema is.
3. After that, it takes them another 52 minutes to get to the gym.
4. So, the total time taken to reach the gym the first time is:
   \[
   16 + 52 = 68 \text{ minutes}
   \]
5. Now, they realize they forgot their wallets at home, so they need to return home. The time taken to return to their home is the same as the time taken to get to the gym, which is 52 minutes.
6. Therefore, the time taken to return home is:
   \[
   52 \text{ minutes}
   \]
7. After picking up their wallets, they need to walk back to the gym again, which takes another 52 minutes.
8. So, the total time taken for the round trip (home to gym and back) is:
   \[
   52 + 52 = 104 \text{ minutes}
   \]
9. Now, we add the time taken to reach the gym the first time (68 minutes) to the round trip time (104 minutes):
   \[
   68 + 104 = 172 \text{ minutes}
   \]
10. Now, we subtract this total time from the initial 246 minutes they had:
    \[
    246 - 172 = 74 \text{ minutes}
    \]
11. This means they have 74 minutes left to get to the mall.

The answer is 74 minutes.",74.0,0,1,0,110.0,"--- Beginning of the template ---

Question: Emma and Liam have 300 minutes to reach a concert starting from their house. It takes them 20 minutes to walk to the park. After visiting the park, they take another 40 minutes to get to the library. Realizing they left their tickets at home, they return to get them and then walk back to the library. How much time do they have left to get to the concert without being late?

Wrong answer: I calculated that they have 300 - (20 + 40 + 20 + 40) = 180 minutes left, but I forgot to account for the time it takes to return to the library after getting the tickets.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total time spent by not including the return trip to the library after picking up the tickets, which resulted in an incorrect remaining time calculation.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Time management
- Return trip

Instructions:
1. Identify the total time available for the journey.
2. Break down the journey into segments and calculate the time taken for each segment.
3. Include any return trips in the total time calculation.
4. Subtract the total time spent from the initial time available to find the remaining time.
5. Ensure all segments of the journey are accounted for before concluding.

Advice:
- Always double-check that all parts of the journey are included in your calculations.
- Write down each segment of the journey and its corresponding time to avoid missing any details.
- Practice similar problems to become familiar with the structure of time management questions.

Solution:
To solve the problem, first calculate the total time spent:
- Time to park: 20 minutes
- Time to library: 40 minutes
- Time to return home: 20 minutes
- Time to library again: 40 minutes

Total time spent = 20 + 40 + 20 + 40 = 120 minutes.

Now, subtract this from the total time available:

I miscalculated the total time spent by not including the return trip to pick up the wallets and the subsequent return to the gym. This oversight led to an incorrect calculation of the remaining time available to reach the mall.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Time management
- Return trip
- Oversight

### Solution:
To solve the problem step-by-step, we will calculate the total time spent on each segment of the journey, including the return trips.

1. **Time to the cinema**: 16 minutes
2. **Time to the gym**: 52 minutes
3. **Time to return home for wallets**: 16 minutes (same as the time to the cinema)
4. **Time to return to the gym**: 52 minutes (same as the time from the cinema to the gym)

Now, we can calculate the total time spent:
- Total time spent = Time to cinema + Time to gym + Time to return home + Time to gym again
- Total time spent = 16 + 52 + 16 + 52 = 136 minutes

Next, we subtract the total time spent from the initial time available:
- Time available = 246 minutes
- Remaining time = Time available - Total time spent
- Remaining time = 246 - 136 = 110 minutes

### Instructions:
1. Identify the total time available for the journey.
2. Break down the journey into segments and calculate the time taken for each segment.
3. Include any return trips in the total time calculation.
4. Sum all the time spent on each segment, including return trips.
5. Subtract the total time spent from the initial time available to find the remaining time.
6. Double-check that all segments of the journey are accounted for before concluding.

### Advice:
- Always ensure that you account for all parts of the journey, including any return trips.
- Write down each segment of the journey and its corresponding time to avoid missing any details.
- Practice similar problems to become familiar with the structure of time management questions.
- Review your calculations step-by-step to catch any potential oversights.

Question: Emma and Liam have 300 minutes to reach a concert starting from their house. It takes them 20 minutes to walk to the park. After visiting the park for 30 minutes, they realize they left their tickets at home, so they must return home to get them and then walk back to the park. Once they reach the park again, how much time do they have left to get to the concert without being late?

Wrong answer: I calculated that they have 300 - 20 - 30 = 250 minutes left after visiting the park, and then I subtracted 20 minutes for the return trip, thinking they would have 230 minutes left to get to the concert. I forgot to account for the time spent returning to the park.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total time spent by not including the time taken to return to the park after getting the tickets. I only considered the time spent walking to the park and the time spent there, neglecting the return trip.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Time management
- Return trip oversight

Instructions:
1. Identify the total time available for the trip.
2. Calculate the time taken to reach the first destination (e.g., park).
3. Add any time spent at that destination.
4. Calculate the return time to the starting point.
5. Add the return time to the time already spent.
6. Subtract the total time spent from the initial total time to find the remaining time.
7. Finally, determine the time needed to reach the final destination (e.g., concert) and compare it to the remaining time.

Advice:
- Always account for all segments of the journey, including return trips.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid missing any details.
- Double-check calculations to ensure all time spent is included.

Solution:
Total time spent = 20 minutes (to park) + 30 minutes (at park) + 20 minutes (return home) + 20 minutes (back to park) = 90 minutes. Remaining time = 300 - 90 = 210 minutes. They have 210 minutes left to get to the concert without being late.

1. **Identify the total time available**: 246 minutes.
2. **Calculate the time taken to reach the cinema**: 16 minutes.
3. **Calculate the time taken to reach the gym from the cinema**: 52 minutes.
4. **Total time spent to reach the gym**: 
   - Time to cinema: 16 minutes
   - Time to gym: 52 minutes
   - Total to gym: 16 + 52 = 68 minutes.
5. **Time spent at the gym**: 0 minutes (they just realize they forgot their wallets).
6. **Calculate the return time to home**: 68 minutes (to gym) + 68 minutes (return to home) = 68 + 68 = 136 minutes.
7. **Calculate the time taken to return to the gym**: 68 minutes.
8. **Total time spent**: 
   - To gym: 68 minutes
   - Return home: 68 minutes
   - Back to gym: 68 minutes
   - Total time spent: 68 + 68 + 68 = 204 minutes.
9. **Calculate remaining time**: 
   - Total time available: 246 minutes
   - Total time spent: 204 minutes
   - Remaining time = 246 - 204 = 42 minutes.
10. **Determine the time needed to get to the mall**: Since the problem does not specify the time to the mall, we assume they need to leave immediately after reaching the gym. Therefore, they have 42 minutes left to get to the mall without being late.

### Final Answer:
Sofia and Benjamin have **42 minutes** left to get to the mall without being late.

### Instructions:
1. Identify the total time available for the trip.
2. Break down the journey into segments (to first destination, time spent there, return trips).
3. Calculate the time taken for each segment.
4. Sum the total time spent on the journey.
5. Subtract the total time spent from the initial total time to find the remaining time.
6. If applicable, determine the time needed to reach the final destination and compare it to the remaining time.

### General Advice:
- Always account for all parts of the journey, including any return trips.
- Break the problem down into smaller, manageable parts to ensure no details are overlooked.
- Double-check calculations to ensure all time spent is included and accurately accounted for.
- If the problem involves multiple destinations, list them out to avoid confusion.","--- Beginning of the template ---

[Example Input]
Question: Emma and Liam have 300 minutes to reach a concert starting from their house. It takes them 20 minutes to walk to the park. After visiting the park for 30 minutes, they realize they left their tickets at home, so they must return home to get them and then walk back to the park. Once they reach the park again, how much time do they have left to get to the concert without being late?

Wrong answer: I calculated that they have 300 - 20 - 30 = 250 minutes left after visiting the park, and then I subtracted 20 minutes for the return trip, thinking they would have 230 minutes left to get to the concert. I forgot to account for the time spent returning to the park.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total time spent by not including the time taken to return to the park after getting the tickets. I only considered the time spent walking to the park and the time spent there, neglecting the return trip.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Time management
- Return trip oversight

Instructions:
1. Identify the total time available for the trip.
2. Calculate the time taken to reach the first destination (e.g., park).
3. Add any time spent at that destination.
4. Calculate the return time to the starting point.
5. Add the return time to the time already spent.
6. Subtract the total time spent from the initial total time to find the remaining time.
7. Finally, determine the time needed to reach the final destination (e.g., concert) and compare it to the remaining time.

Advice:
- Always account for all segments of the journey, including return trips.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid missing any details.
- Double-check calculations to ensure all time spent is included.

Solution:
Total time spent = 20 minutes (to park) + 30 minutes (at park) + 20 minutes (return home) + 20 minutes (back to park) = 90 minutes. Remaining time = 300 - 90 = 210 minutes. They have 210 minutes left to get to the concert without being late.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Leon wants to make different sized ice cubes with 312 ounces of water. He can make giant cubes that use 12 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 5 ounces, small cubes that use 1/2 of a ounce, and tiny cubes that are half the size of small cubes. He makes 48 total ice cubes, including 10 giant cubes, 14 small cubes, 12 medium cubes, and some tiny cubes. How many ounces of water does Leon have left?",122.0,"To find out how many ounces of water Leon has left after making the ice cubes, we first need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of ice cube he made.

1. **Giant Cubes**:
   - Number of giant cubes = 10
   - Ounces per giant cube = 12
   - Total ounces used for giant cubes = \(10 \times 12 = 120\) ounces

2. **Medium Cubes**:
   - Number of medium cubes = 12
   - Ounces per medium cube = 5
   - Total ounces used for medium cubes = \(12 \times 5 = 60\) ounces

3. **Small Cubes**:
   - Number of small cubes = 14
   - Ounces per small cube = 0.5 (1/2 ounce)
   - Total ounces used for small cubes = \(14 \times 0.5 = 7\) ounces

4. **Tiny Cubes**:
   - Let \(x\) be the number of tiny cubes.
   - Ounces per tiny cube = \(0.5 \div 2 = 0.25\) ounces
   - Total ounces used for tiny cubes = \(x \times 0.25\) ounces

Next, we know that the total number of ice cubes made is 48. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
10 + 12 + 14 + x = 48
\]

Calculating the left side:

\[
36 + x = 48
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = 48 - 36 = 12
\]

So, Leon made 12 tiny cubes.

Now we can calculate the total ounces of water used for the tiny cubes:

\[
\text{Total ounces used for tiny cubes} = 12 \times 0.25 = 3 \text{ ounces}
\]

Now, we can find the total amount of water used:

\[
\text{Total water used} = \text{Water used for giant cubes} + \text{Water used for medium cubes} + \text{Water used for small cubes} + \text{Water used for tiny cubes}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Total water used} = 120 + 60 + 7 + 3 = 190 \text{ ounces}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water Leon had:

\[
\text{Water left} = 312 - 190 = 122 \text{ ounces}
\]

Thus, the amount of water Leon has left is \(\boxed{122}\) ounces.",122.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Leon starts with 312 ounces of water.
2. He makes 10 giant cubes, and each giant cube uses 12 ounces of water. 
   So, the total water used for giant cubes is:
   \( 10 \times 12 = 120 \) ounces.

3. He makes 12 medium cubes, and each medium cube uses 5 ounces of water.
   So, the total water used for medium cubes is:
   \( 12 \times 5 = 60 \) ounces.

4. He makes 14 small cubes, and each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water.
   So, the total water used for small cubes is:
   \( 14 \times 0.5 = 7 \) ounces.

5. Now, let's calculate the total water used for all the cubes:
   \[
   \text{Total water used} = 120 + 60 + 7 = 187 \text{ ounces}.
   \]

6. To find out how much water Leon has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:
   \[
   \text{Water left} = 312 - 187 = 125 \text{ ounces}.
   \]

[Example Input]
Question: Sarah has 250 ounces of juice. She can make large servings that use 15 ounces each, medium servings that use 8 ounces each, and small servings that use 2 ounces each. She makes 30 total servings, including 5 large servings, 10 small servings, and some medium servings. How many ounces of juice does Sarah have left?

Wrong answer: I calculated the total ounces used by the large servings (5 * 15 = 75 ounces) and the small servings (10 * 2 = 20 ounces), which totals 95 ounces. I then subtracted this from 250 ounces, giving me 155 ounces left. I forgot to account for the medium servings.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total amount of juice used by not including the medium servings in my calculations.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Omission
- Resource allocation

Instructions:
1. Identify the total amount of resource available (in this case, juice).
2. Determine the number of each type of serving made and the amount of juice each serving type requires.
3. Calculate the total amount of juice used for each type of serving.
4. Sum the total juice used across all serving types.
5. Subtract the total juice used from the initial amount to find the remaining juice.

Advice:
- Always double-check that all types of items or servings are included in your calculations.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to ensure clarity and accuracy.
- Keep track of units and conversions to avoid mistakes in resource allocation.

Solution:
First, calculate the total ounces used:
- Large servings: 5 * 15 = 75 ounces
- Small servings: 10 * 2 = 20 ounces
- Let x be the number of medium servings. Each medium serving uses 8 ounces, so the total for medium servings is 8x ounces.

The total number of servings is 30:
5 (large) + 10 (small) + x (medium) = 30
x = 15 (medium servings)

Now calculate the total ounces used:
- Medium servings: 15 * 8 = 120 ounces

Total ounces used = 75 + 20 + 120 = 215 ounces.

Finally, subtract from the initial amount:
250 - 215 = 35 ounces left.

Thus, Sarah has 35 ounces of juice left.

What percentage of the students like to play video games if the number of the students that like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football?",5.0,"To find the percentage of students who like to play video games, we first need to determine how many students like to bake and how many like to play video games.

1. **Identify the number of students who like to play football:**
   - The number of students who like to play football is given as 13.

2. **Calculate the number of students who like to bake:**
   - According to the problem, the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number of students who like to play football.
   - Therefore, the number of students who like to bake can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of students who like to bake} = 4 \times 13 - 3 = 52 - 3 = 49
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of students who like hiking, chess, swimming, football, and baking:**
   - We have the following numbers:
     - Students who like to hike: 69
     - Students who like to play chess: 8
     - Students who like to swim: 13
     - Students who like to play football: 13
     - Students who like to bake: 49
   - Now, we sum these numbers:
     \[
     \text{Total students with known hobbies} = 69 + 8 + 13 + 13 + 49 = 152
     \]

4. **Determine the number of students who like to play video games:**
   - The total number of students in the class is 160. Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is:
     \[
     \text{Number of students who like to play video games} = 160 - 152 = 8
     \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of students who like to play video games:**
   - To find the percentage, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of students who like to play video games}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values we have:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{8}{160} \right) \times 100 = 5\%
     \]

Thus, the percentage of students who like to play video games is \( \boxed{5\%} \).",5.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. We start with a class of 160 students.
2. The number of students who like to hike is 69.
3. The number of students who like to play chess is 8.
4. The number of students who like to swim is 13.
5. The number of students who like to play football is 13.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who have specified hobbies:

- Total students with specified hobbies = 69 (hike) + 8 (chess) + 13 (swim) + 13 (football)
- Total students with specified hobbies = 69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103

Next, we find out how many students are left who like either to play video games or bake:

- Students who like video games or bake = Total students - Students with specified hobbies
- Students who like video games or bake = 160 - 103 = 57

Now, we need to find out how many students like to bake. We know that the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number of students who like to play football:

- Number of students who like to play football = 13
- Four times the number of students who like to play football = 4 * 13 = 52
- Therefore, the number of students who like to bake = 52 - 3 = 49

Now, we can find the number of students who like to play video games:

- Students who like video games = Students who like video games or bake - Students who like to bake
- Students who like video games = 57 - 49 = 8

Finally, we calculate the percentage of students who like to play video games:

- Percentage of students who like to play video games = (Number of students who like video games / Total students) * 100
- Percentage of students who like to play video games = (8 / 160) * 100 = 5%

His friends have chipped in and will cover the cost of all the food for the workshop. Oliver has also applied for help from the local charity, which has decided to cover 1/10 of the remaining cost of the workshop. How much money is Oliver still missing?",113.0,"To determine how much money Oliver is still missing, we first need to calculate the total cost of the workshop for the 2 days.

1. **Calculate the total cost for each day:**
   - Hotel: ₣100
   - Food: ₣20 (covered by friends)
   - Transportation: ₣10

   Total cost for one day:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for one day} = \text{Hotel} + \text{Food} + \text{Transportation} = 100 + 20 + 10 = ₣130
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost for 2 days:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 2 days} = 2 \times \text{Total cost for one day} = 2 \times 130 = ₣260
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost that Oliver needs to cover after food is paid by friends:**
   Since the food cost is covered by friends, we need to subtract the food cost from the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Total cost without food} = \text{Total cost for 2 days} - \text{Food cost for 2 days}
   \]
   The food cost for 2 days is:
   \[
   \text{Food cost for 2 days} = 2 \times 20 = ₣40
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Total cost without food} = 260 - 40 = ₣220

4. **Calculate the amount covered by the local charity:**
   The charity covers \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the remaining cost:
   \[
   \text{Amount covered by charity} = \frac{1}{10} \times 220 = ₣22

5. **Calculate the remaining cost after charity contribution:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining cost} = \text{Total cost without food} - \text{Amount covered by charity} = 220 - 22 = ₣198
   \]

6. **Calculate how much money Oliver has and how much he is missing:**
   Oliver has ₣85. Therefore, the amount he is still missing is:
   \[
   \text{Amount missing} = \text{Remaining cost} - \text{Oliver's money} = 198 - 85 = ₣113
   \]

Thus, Oliver is still missing **₣113**.",113.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost for one day:**
   - Hotel cost: ₣100
   - Food cost: ₣20 (covered by friends)
   - Transportation cost: ₣10
   - Total cost for one day = Hotel + Food + Transportation = ₣100 + ₣20 + ₣10 = ₣130

2. **Calculate the total cost for two days:**
   - Total cost for two days = 2 * Total cost for one day = 2 * ₣130 = ₣260

3. **Determine the amount covered by friends:**
   - Since friends are covering the food cost for both days, we need to subtract the food cost from the total cost.
   - Total food cost for two days = 2 * ₣20 = ₣40
   - Remaining cost after food = Total cost for two days - Total food cost = ₣260 - ₣40 = ₣220

4. **Calculate the amount covered by the local charity:**
   - The charity covers 1/10 of the remaining cost.
   - Amount covered by charity = 1/10 * Remaining cost = 1/10 * ₣220 = ₣22

5. **Calculate the remaining cost after charity contribution:**
   - Remaining cost after charity = Remaining cost - Amount covered by charity = ₣220 - ₣22 = ₣198

The bakery has a promotion that if one buys 7 bagels or more, they get a 20% discount on bagels. How much more do 4 loaves of bread cost than 8 bagels?",12.0,"To find out how much more 4 loaves of bread cost than 8 bagels, we will first calculate the cost of the bagels, including any applicable discounts, and then compare it to the cost of the loaves of bread.

1. **Calculate the cost of a bagel:**
   The cost of a loaf of bread is €5. The cost of a bagel is one-fourth of a loaf of bread:
   \[
   \text{Cost of a bagel} = \frac{1}{4} \times 5 = \frac{5}{4} = 1.25 \text{ euros}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of 8 bagels:**
   The cost of 8 bagels without any discount is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 8 bagels} = 8 \times 1.25 = 10 \text{ euros}
   \]

3. **Check if the discount applies:**
   Since the bakery has a promotion that gives a 20% discount on bagels if you buy 7 or more, we will apply this discount to the cost of 8 bagels.
   The discount amount is:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 20\% \text{ of } 10 = 0.20 \times 10 = 2 \text{ euros}
   \]
   Therefore, the cost of 8 bagels after the discount is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 8 bagels after discount} = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ euros}

4. **Calculate the cost of 4 loaves of bread:**
   The cost of 4 loaves of bread is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 4 loaves} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ euros}
   \]

5. **Find the difference in cost:**
   Now, we will find out how much more 4 loaves of bread cost than 8 bagels:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Cost of 4 loaves} - \text{Cost of 8 bagels after discount} = 20 - 8 = 12 \text{ euros}

Jamal starts with $80 and wants 10 gallons of paint, each priced at $7.0, and 3 carpenter pencils, each costing $2. The store offers a 10% discount on paint for members. How much more money does Elena have left than Jamal after they leave the store?",8.0,"To determine how much more money Elena has left than Jamal after they leave the store, we need to calculate the total costs for both Elena and Jamal and then find their remaining balances.

### Step 1: Calculate Elena's total expenses

1. **Cost of anchors**:
   - Price per anchor = $0.26
   - Number of anchors = 15
   - Total cost for anchors = \( 15 \times 0.26 = 3.90 \)

2. **Cost of nails**:
   - Price per nail = $0.61
   - Number of nails = 9
   - Total cost for nails = \( 9 \times 0.61 = 5.49 \)

3. **Cost of paint**:
   - Price per gallon of paint = $7.00
   - Number of gallons = 10
   - Total cost for paint = \( 10 \times 7.00 = 70.00 \)

4. **Total cost for Elena**:
   - Total cost = Cost of anchors + Cost of nails + Cost of paint
   - Total cost = \( 3.90 + 5.49 + 70.00 = 79.39 \)

5. **Remaining balance for Elena**:
   - Initial amount = $98.39
   - Remaining balance = Initial amount - Total cost
   - Remaining balance = \( 98.39 - 79.39 = 19.00 \)

### Step 2: Calculate Jamal's total expenses

1. **Cost of paint** (with discount):
   - Price per gallon of paint = $7.00
   - Number of gallons = 10
   - Total cost for paint = \( 10 \times 7.00 = 70.00 \)
   - Discount for members = 10%
   - Discount amount = \( 70.00 \times 0.10 = 7.00 \)
   - Total cost for paint after discount = \( 70.00 - 7.00 = 63.00 \)

2. **Cost of carpenter pencils**:
   - Price per pencil = $2.00
   - Number of pencils = 3
   - Total cost for pencils = \( 3 \times 2.00 = 6.00 \)

3. **Total cost for Jamal**:
   - Total cost = Cost of paint + Cost of pencils
   - Total cost = \( 63.00 + 6.00 = 69.00 \)

4. **Remaining balance for Jamal**:
   - Initial amount = $80.00

1. **Difference in remaining balances**:
   - Difference = Elena's remaining balance - Jamal's remaining balance
   - Difference = \( 19.00 - 11.00 = 8.00 \)

### Conclusion

Elena has **$8.00** more than Jamal after they leave the store.",8.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate Elena's total expenses.**

- **Cost of anchors:**
  Each anchor costs $0.26, and she wants to buy 15 anchors.
  \[
  \text{Total cost of anchors} = 15 \times 0.26 = 3.90
  \]

- **Cost of nails:**
  Each nail costs $0.61, and she needs 9 nails.
  \[
  \text{Total cost of nails} = 9 \times 0.61 = 5.49

- **Cost of paint:**
  She picks up 10 gallons of paint, each priced at $7.00.
  \[
  \text{Total cost of paint} = 10 \times 7.00 = 70.00
  \]

- **Total expenses for Elena:**
  \[
  \text{Total expenses} = \text{Cost of anchors} + \text{Cost of nails} + \text{Cost of paint}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total expenses} = 3.90 + 5.49 + 70.00 = 79.39

- **Total expenses for Jamal:**
  \[
  \text{Total expenses} = \text{Cost of paint} + \text{Cost of pencils}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total expenses} = 63.00 + 6.00 = 69.00
  \]

- **Money left for Jamal:**
  He starts with $80.
  \[
  \text{Money left} = 80 - 69.00 = 11.00
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate how much more money Elena has left than Jamal.**

After 2 days, DeShawn decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half. How many days will it take for the cake to be fully eaten?",4.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the daily consumption of each person:**
   - Arash eats 5 pieces a day.
   - Ava eats twice as much as Arash: 
     \[
     \text{Ava's consumption} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pieces per day}
     \]
   - DeShawn eats twice as much as Ava:
     \[
     \text{DeShawn's consumption} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ pieces per day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total consumption for the first 2 days:**
   - In one day, the total consumption of all three is:
     \[
     \text{Total daily consumption} = 5 + 10 + 20 = 35 \text{ pieces}
     \]
   - In 2 days, they will consume:
     \[
     \text{Total consumption in 2 days} = 2 \times 35 = 70 \text{ pieces}
     \]

3. **Calculate the remaining pieces of cake after 2 days:**
   - Initially, there are 120 pieces. After 2 days of consumption:
     \[
     \text{Remaining pieces} = 120 - 70 = 50 \text{ pieces}
     \]

4. **Determine DeShawn's new consumption rate after going on a diet:**
   - After 2 days, DeShawn cuts his consumption in half:
     \[
     \text{DeShawn's new consumption} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ pieces per day}

Thus, it will take a total of **4 days** for the cake to be fully eaten.",4.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine how much each person eats per day:**
   - Arash eats 5 pieces a day.
   - Ava eats twice as much as Arash, so she eats 5 * 2 = 10 pieces a day.
   - DeShawn eats two times as much as Ava, so he eats 10 * 2 = 20 pieces a day.

2. **Calculate the total pieces eaten by all three in the first 2 days:**
   - In one day, the total pieces eaten by Arash, Ava, and DeShawn is:
     - Arash: 5 pieces
     - Ava: 10 pieces
     - DeShawn: 20 pieces
     - Total per day = 5 + 10 + 20 = 35 pieces.
   - In 2 days, they will eat:
     - Total in 2 days = 35 * 2 = 70 pieces.

3. **Calculate the remaining pieces of cake after 2 days:**
   - Initially, there are 120 pieces.
   - After 2 days, the remaining pieces are:
     - Remaining = 120 - 70 = 50 pieces.

4. **Determine DeShawn's new eating rate after going on a diet:**
   - After 2 days, DeShawn decides to cut his consumption by half, so he now eats:
     - New DeShawn's rate = 20 / 2 = 10 pieces a day.

5. **Calculate the total pieces eaten by all three after DeShawn's diet:**
   - Now, Arash eats 5 pieces, Ava eats 10 pieces, and DeShawn eats 10 pieces.
   - Total pieces eaten per day after DeShawn's diet:
     - Total = 5 + 10 + 10 = 25 pieces.

6. **Calculate how many more days it will take to eat the remaining 50 pieces:**
   - To find out how many days it will take to eat the remaining 50 pieces at a rate of 25 pieces per day:
     - Days needed = Remaining pieces / Total eaten per day = 50 / 25 = 2 days.

The crayon box has 12 different colors of crayon, and the sticker book has 6 pages, each with 12 stickers. The tower of stacking rings has 29 multicolored rings on it. Gabrielle recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of items for her nephew up to 320. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?",63.0,"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we first need to calculate the total number of items Gabrielle already has before adding the bouncy balls.

1. **Building Blocks**: 43 blocks
2. **Stuffed Animals**: 5 stuffed animals
3. **Action Figures**: The number of action figures is twice the number of blocks and stuffed animals combined. 
   - First, we calculate the total number of blocks and stuffed animals:
     \[
     43 + 5 = 48

   - Now, we find the number of action figures:
     \[
     2 \times 48 = 96 \text{ action figures}

4. **Crayon Box**: 12 different colors of crayon
5. **Sticker Book**: 6 pages, each with 12 stickers. The total number of stickers is:
   \[
   6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ stickers}
   \]
6. **Tower of Stacking Rings**: 29 multicolored rings

Now, we can sum all these items to find the total number of items Gabrielle has before adding the bouncy balls:

\[
\text{Total items} = \text{Building Blocks} + \text{Stuffed Animals} + \text{Action Figures} + \text{Crayon Box} + \text{Sticker Book} + \text{Tower of Stacking Rings}

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total items} = 43 + 5 + 96 + 12 + 72 + 29

On Wednesday, he sold 27 boxes of muffin and 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie, than on Thursday. On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday and 21 boxes of apricot pie. On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?",796.0,"To find Faisal's average daily earning, we first need to determine how many boxes of muffins and apricot pies he sold each day.

### Step 1: Determine the number of boxes sold on Wednesday

Let:
- \( m_W \) = number of boxes of muffins sold on Wednesday = 27
- \( a_W \) = number of boxes of apricot pies sold on Wednesday

According to the problem, Faisal sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pies on Wednesday than on Thursday. We will denote the number of boxes sold on Thursday as \( a_T \).

From the problem, we know:
\[
a_W = a_T - 13
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of boxes sold on Thursday

On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday:
\[
m_T = m_W + 11 = 27 + 11 = 38
\]

We also know that on Thursday, he sold 21 boxes of apricot pies:
\[
a_T = 21
\]

Now we can find the number of apricot pies sold on Wednesday:
\[
a_W = a_T - 13 = 21 - 13 = 8
\]

### Summary of sales:
- Wednesday: 27 muffins and 8 apricot pies
- Thursday: 38 muffins and 21 apricot pies

### Step 3: Determine the number of boxes sold on Friday

On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. First, we calculate the total sales from Wednesday and Thursday.

**Total muffins sold:**
\[
m_W + m_T = 27 + 38 = 65
\]

**Total apricot pies sold:**
\[
a_W + a_T = 8 + 21 = 29
\]

**Total boxes sold over the two days:**
\[
\text{Total boxes} = 65 + 29 = 94
\]

Thus, on Friday, he sold 94 boxes.

### Step 4: Calculate the earnings for each day

**Earnings from Wednesday:**
- Muffins: \( 27 \times 9 = 243 \)
- Apricot pies: \( 8 \times 21 = 168 \)
- Total earnings on Wednesday: 
\[
243 + 168 = 411
\]

**Earnings from Thursday:**
- Muffins: \( 38 \times 9 = 342 \)
- Apricot pies: \( 21 \times 21 = 441 \)
- Total earnings on Thursday: 
\[
342 + 441 = 783

**Earnings from Friday:**
- Total boxes sold: 94
- Total earnings on Friday:
\[
94 \times 9 + 94 \times 21 = 94 \times (9 + 21) = 94 \times 30 = 2820
\]

### Step 5: Calculate total earnings over the three days

**Total earnings:**
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 411 + 783 + 2820 = 4014
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the average daily earning

There are 3 days, so the average daily earning is:
\[
\text{Average daily earning} = \frac{4014}{3} = 1338
\]

Thus, Faisal's average daily earning is **₺1338**.",1338.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Sales on Wednesday:**
   - Faisal sold 27 boxes of muffins.
   - He sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pies than on Thursday. Let's denote the number of apricot pies sold on Thursday as \( x \). Therefore, the number of apricot pies sold on Wednesday is \( x - 13 \).

2. **Sales on Thursday:**
   - On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday. So, the number of muffins sold on Thursday is \( 27 + 11 = 38 \).
   - We know he sold 21 boxes of apricot pies on Thursday.

3. **Setting up the equations:**
   - From the information above, we have:
     - Apricot pies sold on Thursday: \( x = 21 \)
     - Therefore, apricot pies sold on Wednesday: \( 21 - 13 = 8 \).

4. **Sales Summary:**
   - Wednesday: 
     - Muffins: 27
     - Apricot pies: 8
   - Thursday:
     - Muffins: 38
     - Apricot pies: 21

5. **Sales on Friday:**
   - On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined.
   - Total sales from Wednesday: \( 27 + 8 = 35 \).
   - Total sales from Thursday: \( 38 + 21 = 59 \).
   - Total sales from Wednesday and Thursday combined: \( 35 + 59 = 94 \).
   - Therefore, on Friday, he sold 94 boxes.

6. **Calculating total earnings:**
   - Earnings from muffins:
     - Wednesday: \( 27 \times 9 = 243 \) ₺
     - Thursday: \( 38 \times 9 = 342 \) ₺
     - Friday: \( 94 \times 9 = 846 \) ₺
   - Total earnings from muffins: \( 243 + 342 + 846 = 1431 \) ₺
   
   - Earnings from apricot pies:
     - Wednesday: \( 8 \times 21 = 168 \) ₺
     - Thursday: \( 21 \times 21 = 441 \) ₺
     - Friday: \( 0 \) ₺ (since he sold only muffins on Friday)
   - Total earnings from apricot pies: \( 168 + 441 + 0 = 609 \) ₺

7. **Total earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from muffins + Earnings from apricot pies
   - Total earnings = \( 1431 + 609 = 2040 \) ₺

8. **Calculating average daily earnings:**
   - There are 3 days of sales (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday).
   - Average daily earnings = Total earnings / Number of days
   - Average daily earnings = \( 2040 / 3 = 680 \) ₺

The answer is 680 ₺.",680.0,0,1,0,1072.0,"--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

[Example Input]
Question: Sarah is selling cookies and brownies for a school event. On Monday, she sold 15 boxes of cookies and 5 fewer boxes of brownies than on Tuesday. On Tuesday, she sold 10 more boxes of cookies than on Monday and 20 boxes of brownies. On Wednesday, she sold as much as she did in the past two days combined. If the cookie cost $2 and the brownie cost $3, what was Sarah's average daily earning?

Wrong answer: I calculated the total boxes sold incorrectly. I thought she sold 25 boxes of cookies on Tuesday, but it was actually 25 boxes of brownies. This led me to miscalculate the total earnings.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of boxes sold on Tuesday, confusing the quantities of cookies and brownies, which resulted in an incorrect total for the average earnings.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Confusion of quantities
- Incorrect total

Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify the quantities sold each day.
2. Set up equations based on the relationships given in the problem.
3. Calculate the total number of boxes sold for each item on each day.
4. Determine the total earnings for each day by multiplying the number of boxes sold by their respective prices.
5. Calculate the average daily earning by summing the total earnings and dividing by the number of days.

Advice:
- Always double-check the relationships between quantities before calculating totals.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion.
- Write down the equations clearly to visualize the relationships.

Solution:
On Monday, Sarah sold 15 boxes of cookies and 10 boxes of brownies (5 fewer than Tuesday). On Tuesday, she sold 25 boxes of cookies (15 + 10) and 20 boxes of brownies. On Wednesday, she sold 45 boxes (25 + 20) combined. The total earnings are calculated as follows: 
- Monday: (15 * $2) + (10 * $3) = $30 + $30 = $60
- Tuesday: (25 * $2) + (20 * $3) = $50 + $60 = $110
- Wednesday: (45 * $2) + (40 * $3) = $90 + $120 = $210
Total earnings = $60 + $110 + $210 = $380
Average daily earning = $380 / 3 = $126.67

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of boxes sold on Thursday and Friday, which led to an incorrect total for the average earnings. I also failed to correctly account for the relationship between the quantities sold on different days, which compounded my errors.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Confusion of quantities
- Incorrect total
- Misinterpretation of relationships

### Solution:
1. **Identify the quantities sold each day:**
   - **Wednesday:**
     - Muffins: 27 boxes
     - Apricot pies: 13 fewer than Thursday
   - **Thursday:**
     - Muffins: 27 + 11 = 38 boxes
     - Apricot pies: 21 boxes
   - **Friday:**
     - Total sold on Wednesday and Thursday:
       - Wednesday: 27 muffins + (38 - 13) apricot pies = 27 muffins + 25 apricot pies = 52 boxes
       - Thursday: 38 muffins + 21 apricot pies = 59 boxes
       - Total for Friday: 52 + 59 = 111 boxes

2. **Calculate the total number of boxes sold:**
   - **Wednesday:**
     - Apricot pies: 38 - 13 = 25 boxes
   - **Thursday:**
     - Apricot pies: 21 boxes
   - **Friday:**
     - Total boxes sold = 111 boxes (as calculated above)

3. **Calculate the total earnings for each day:**
   - **Wednesday:**
     - Earnings = (27 muffins * ₺9) + (25 apricot pies * ₺21)
     - Earnings = (27 * 9) + (25 * 21) = 243 + 525 = ₺768
   - **Thursday:**
     - Earnings = (38 muffins * ₺9) + (21 apricot pies * ₺21)
     - Earnings = (38 * 9) + (21 * 21) = 342 + 441 = ₺783
   - **Friday:**
     - Earnings = (111 boxes sold) * average price per box
     - Average price = (₺9 + ₺21) / 2 = ₺15
     - Earnings = 111 * 15 = ₺1665

4. **Total earnings:**
   - Total earnings = ₺768 (Wednesday) + ₺783 (Thursday) + ₺1665 (Friday) = ₺3216

5. **Calculate the average daily earning:**
   - Average daily earning = Total earnings / 3
   - Average daily earning = ₺3216 / 3 = ₺1072

I miscalculated the total number of boxes sold on Thursday and Friday, which led to an incorrect total for the average earnings. I also failed to properly account for the relationships between the quantities sold on different days.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect total
- Average earnings
- Relationship misunderstanding

### Solution:
1. **Identify the quantities sold:**
   - Let \( m_W \) be the number of muffins sold on Wednesday.
   - Let \( a_W \) be the number of apricot pies sold on Wednesday.
   - Let \( m_T \) be the number of muffins sold on Thursday.
   - Let \( a_T \) be the number of apricot pies sold on Thursday.
   - Let \( m_F \) be the number of muffins sold on Friday.
   - Let \( a_F \) be the number of apricot pies sold on Friday.

2. **Set up the equations based on the problem:**
   - From the problem, we know:
     - \( m_W = 27 \)
     - \( a_W = m_T - 13 \)
     - \( m_T = m_W + 11 = 27 + 11 = 38 \)
     - \( a_T = 21 \)
     - On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined:
       - \( m_F = m_W + m_T = 27 + 38 = 65 \)
       - \( a_F = a_W + a_T = (m_T - 13) + 21 = (38 - 13) + 21 = 46 \)

3. **Calculate the total earnings for each day:**
   - **Wednesday:**
     - Earnings from muffins: \( 27 \times 9 = 243 \)
     - Earnings from apricot pies: \( (m_T - 13) \times 21 = (38 - 13) \times 21 = 25 \times 21 = 525 \)
     - Total earnings on Wednesday: \( 243 + 525 = 768 \)

   - **Thursday:**
     - Earnings from muffins: \( 38 \times 9 = 342 \)
     - Earnings from apricot pies: \( 21 \times 21 = 441 \)
     - Total earnings on Thursday: \( 342 + 441 = 783 \)

   - **Friday:**
     - Earnings from muffins: \( 65 \times 9 = 585 \)
     - Earnings from apricot pies: \( 46 \times 21 = 966 \)
     - Total earnings on Friday: \( 585 + 966 = 1551 \)

4. **Calculate the average daily earning:**
   - Total earnings over three days: \( 768 + 783 + 1551 = 3102 \)
   - Average daily earning: \( \frac{3102}{3} = 1034 \)

### Average Daily Earning:
The correct average daily earning is **₺1034**.

### Instructions for Future Problems:
1. Carefully read the problem to identify all quantities and relationships.
2. Define variables for each quantity involved.
3. Set up equations based on the relationships described in the problem.
4. Calculate the quantities for each day step-by-step.
5. Compute the total earnings for each day by multiplying the quantities sold by their respective prices.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of boxes sold on each day and did not correctly account for the total earnings from muffins and apricot pies. I also failed to set up the equations properly to find the quantities sold each day.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect setup
- Average calculation error
- Misinterpretation of relationships

### Solution:
1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( m_W \) be the number of muffins sold on Wednesday.
   - Let \( a_W \) be the number of apricot pies sold on Wednesday.
   - Let \( m_T \) be the number of muffins sold on Thursday.
   - Let \( a_T \) be the number of apricot pies sold on Thursday.
   - Let \( m_F \) be the number of muffins sold on Friday.
   - Let \( a_F \) be the number of apricot pies sold on Friday.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know:
     - \( m_W = 27 \)
     - \( a_W = m_W - 13 = 27 - 13 = 14 \)
     - \( m_T = m_W + 11 = 27 + 11 = 38 \)
     - \( a_T = 21 \)
     - On Friday, he sold as much as he did on Wednesday and Thursday combined:
       - \( m_F = m_W + m_T = 27 + 38 = 65 \)
       - \( a_F = a_W + a_T = 14 + 21 = 35 \)

3. **Calculate Total Earnings:**
   - Earnings on Wednesday:
     \[
     E_W = (m_W \times 9) + (a_W \times 21) = (27 \times 9) + (14 \times 21) = 243 + 294 = 537
     \]
   - Earnings on Thursday:
     \[
     E_T = (m_T \times 9) + (a_T \times 21) = (38 \times 9) + (21 \times 21) = 342 + 441 = 783
     \]
   - Earnings on Friday:
     \[
     E_F = (m_F \times 9) + (a_F \times 21) = (65 \times 9) + (35 \times 21) = 585 + 735 = 1320
     \]

4. **Calculate Total Earnings Over Three Days:**
   \[
   E_{total} = E_W + E_T + E_F = 537 + 783 + 1320 = 2640
   \]

5. **Calculate Average Daily Earning:**
   \[
   \text{Average Daily Earning} = \frac{E_{total}}{3} = \frac{2640}{3} = 880
   \]

### Final Answer:
Faisal's average daily earning is ₺880.

### Instructions for Future Problems:
1. Carefully define variables for each quantity involved in the problem.
2. Set up equations based on the relationships provided in the problem statement.
3. Solve the equations step-by-step to find the quantities sold each day.
4. Calculate the total earnings for each day using the prices given.
5. Sum the total earnings and divide by the number of days to find the average.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"In Mrs. Garcia's class of 120 students, 50% of the class are swimmers. Out of the remaining class, 45% of the students are choir members or part of dancers. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away tournament. Half of the swimmers are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the tournament?",66.0,"To find out how many students are leaving early to the tournament, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of swimmers:**
   - Total students in the class = 120
   - Percentage of swimmers = 50%
   - Number of swimmers = 50% of 120 = \(0.5 \times 120 = 60\)

2. **Calculate the number of non-swimmers:**
   - Number of non-swimmers = Total students - Number of swimmers
   - Number of non-swimmers = \(120 - 60 = 60\)

3. **Calculate the number of choir members or dancers:**
   - Percentage of non-swimmers who are choir members or dancers = 45%
   - Number of choir members or dancers = 45% of 60 = \(0.45 \times 60 = 27\)

4. **Calculate the number of swimmers who are leaving:**
   - Half of the swimmers are absent due to being sick.
   - Number of swimmers leaving = Half of 60 = \(0.5 \times 60 = 30\)

5. **Calculate the total number of students leaving:**
   - Total students leaving = Number of swimmers leaving + Number of choir members or dancers + Cheerleaders
   - Cheerleaders accompanying each group = 3
   - Total cheerleaders = 3 (for swimmers) + 3 (for choir members/dancers) = 6
   - Total students leaving = 30 (swimmers) + 27 (choir members/dancers) + 6 (cheerleaders) = \(30 + 27 + 6 = 63\)

Thus, the total number of students leaving early to the tournament is **63**.",63.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Total number of students in Mrs. Garcia's class**: 120 students.

2. **Percentage of students who are swimmers**: 50% of 120.
   - Calculation: 50% of 120 = 0.5 * 120 = 60 swimmers.

3. **Remaining students after accounting for swimmers**: 
   - Calculation: 120 - 60 = 60 students.

4. **Percentage of remaining students who are choir members or dancers**: 45% of 60.
   - Calculation: 45% of 60 = 0.45 * 60 = 27 students.

5. **Total number of students leaving early**: 
   - This includes swimmers, choir members, dancers, and cheerleaders.
   - First, we need to find out how many swimmers are leaving.
   - Half of the swimmers are absent due to being sick: 
     - Calculation: Half of 60 = 60 / 2 = 30 swimmers are leaving.

6. **Total students leaving early from the choir and dancers**: 27 students (as calculated earlier).

7. **Total number of cheerleaders accompanying the groups**: 
   - There are 3 cheerleaders for each of the 3 groups (swimmers, choir members, dancers).
   - Total cheerleaders: 3 * 3 = 9 cheerleaders.

8. **Total students leaving early to the tournament**:

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Olga has a flower bed that is 132 meters long. Olga wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Olga's flowers grow 3meters wide so she needs to leave 12 meters between every plant (including the plants width). Olga already owns 7 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ₣9 at the store. However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",31.0,"To determine how much money Olga will spend to fill her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total width occupied by each plant including the space between them.**
   - Each flower is 3 meters wide.
   - The space between each flower is 12 meters.
   - Therefore, the total width occupied by each flower (including the space) is:
     \[
     3 \text{ meters} + 12 \text{ meters} = 15 \text{ meters}
     \]

2. **Determine how many plants can fit in the flower bed.**
   - The length of the flower bed is 132 meters.
   - To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the total width occupied by each plant:
     \[
     \text{Number of plants} = \frac{132 \text{ meters}}{15 \text{ meters}} \approx 8.8
     \]
   - Since Olga cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means she can plant 8 flowers.

3. **Calculate how many additional flowers Olga needs to buy.**
   - Olga already owns 7 flowers.
   - Therefore, the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:
     \[
     8 - 7 = 1 \text{ flower}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the additional flowers.**
   - Each flower costs ₣9.
   - The cost for 1 additional flower is:
     \[
     1 \text{ flower} \times ₣9 = ₣9
     \]

5. **Determine if she qualifies for a discount.**
   - Since Olga is only buying 1 additional flower, she does not qualify for the discount (which applies only if she buys more than 2 plants).

6. **Calculate the total amount spent.**
   - Since she is only buying 1 flower, the total amount spent is simply:
     \[
     ₣9
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Olga will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is **₣9**.",9.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the total width occupied by each plant**: Each flower is 3 meters wide, and there needs to be a 12-meter gap between each plant. Therefore, the total space occupied by each plant (including the gap) is:
   \[
   3 + 12 = 15 \text{ meters}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many plants can fit in the flower bed**: The flower bed is 132 meters long. To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space occupied by each plant:
   \[
   \frac{132}{15} = 8.8
   \]
   Since we can only have whole plants, Olga can fit 8 plants in her flower bed.

3. **Determine how many more plants Olga needs to buy**: Olga already owns 7 flowers. Therefore, the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:
   \[
   8 - 7 = 1 \text{ plant}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the additional plants**: Each flowering plant costs ₣9. Since Olga only needs to buy 1 plant, the total cost for the additional plant is:
   \[
   1 \times 9 = ₣9
   \]

5. **Check for discounts**: Olga is not buying more than 2 plants, so she does not qualify for the ₣5 discount.

6. **Calculate the total amount spent**: Since there is no discount, the total amount Olga will spend at the store is:
   \[
   ₣9
   \]

- Be mindful of any discounts and ensure they are applied correctly based on the conditions provided.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid missing important details.

Solution:
1. Each tree plus the space takes up 4 meters (tree) + 10 meters (space) = 14 meters.
2. The total number of trees that can fit is 100 meters / 14 meters = approximately 7 trees (since we can't have a fraction of a tree).
3. Sarah already has 5 trees, so she needs to buy 7 - 5 = 2 more trees.
4. The cost for 2 trees is 2 * ₣12 = ₣24. Since she is buying 2 trees, she does not qualify for the discount.
5. Therefore, Sarah will spend ₣24 at the store to fill her garden.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly by failing to calculate the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed. I did not consider the width of each plant and the required spacing correctly, which led to an incorrect conclusion about the total cost.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Spacing error
- Total cost calculation error

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the total width occupied by each plant and the space needed between them:**
   - Each plant is 3 meters wide, and the space needed between each plant is 12 meters.
   - Total width occupied by one plant and its space = 3 meters (plant width) + 12 meters (space) = 15 meters.

2. **Calculate how many plants can fit in the total length of the flower bed:**
   - Total length of the flower bed = 132 meters.
   - Number of plants that can fit = 132 meters / 15 meters = 8.8. Since we can only plant whole plants, we round down to 8 plants.

3. **Subtract the number of plants Olga already has from the total number of plants that can fit:**
   - Olga already has 7 plants.
   - Additional plants needed = 8 (total plants) - 7 (existing plants) = 1 more plant.

4. **Calculate the total cost of the plants she needs to buy:**
   - Cost for 1 plant = 1 * ₣9 = ₣9.

5. **Check if the number of plants purchased qualifies for a discount:**
   - Olga is buying 1 new plant, and since she already has 7, the total number of plants will be 8. However, she only needs to buy 1 more, which does not qualify for the discount (the discount applies if she buys more than 2 plants).
   - Therefore, no discount applies.

6. **Final total cost:**
   - Total cost = ₣9 (no discount applied).

### Detailed Instructions:
1. Identify the width of each plant and the required spacing between them.
2. Calculate the total width occupied by one plant and its spacing.
3. Divide the total length of the flower bed by the total width occupied by one plant and its space to find out how many plants can fit.
4. Subtract the number of existing plants from the total number of plants that can fit to determine how many more are needed.
5. Calculate the cost of the additional plants needed.
6. Check if the total number of plants purchased qualifies for any discounts and apply them if applicable.
7. Sum up the total cost after applying any discounts.

### General Advice:
- Always carefully read the dimensions and spacing requirements in word problems.
- Break the problem down into manageable steps to avoid confusion.
- Keep track of any discounts or special offers that may affect the total cost.
- Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy before finalizing your answer.

### New Answer:
Olga will spend ₣9 at the store to fill up her flower bed.","--- Beginning of the template ---

[Example Input]
Question: Sarah has a garden that is 100 meters long. She wants to plant trees that are 4 meters wide and needs to leave 10 meters between each tree (including the tree's width). Sarah already has 5 trees. Each tree costs ₣12, but if she buys more than 3 trees, she will receive a ₣6 discount on her total purchase. How much will Sarah spend at the store to fill her garden?

Wrong answer: I calculated that Sarah can fit 20 trees in her garden, so I multiplied 20 by ₣12, which equals ₣240. I didn't account for the spacing correctly and forgot to apply the discount.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of trees that could fit in the garden by not properly considering the width of each tree and the required spacing between them. I also forgot to apply the discount correctly.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Spacing error
- Discount application error

Instructions:
1. Determine the total width occupied by each tree and the space needed between them (tree width + space).
2. Calculate how many trees can fit in the total length of the garden by dividing the total length by the total width occupied by one tree and its space.
3. Subtract the number of trees Sarah already has from the total number of trees that can fit to find out how many more she needs to buy.
4. Calculate the total cost of the trees she needs to buy.
5. Check if the number of trees purchased qualifies for a discount and apply it if applicable.

Advice:
- Always double-check the dimensions and spacing in word problems.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid confusion.
- Keep track of any discounts or special offers that may affect the total cost.
- Review your calculations to ensure accuracy before finalizing your answer.

Solution:
1. Each tree and its spacing occupy 4 meters (tree width) + 10 meters (space) = 14 meters.
2. The total number of trees that can fit is 100 meters / 14 meters = approximately 7 trees (since we can only plant whole trees).
3. Sarah already has 5 trees, so she needs 7 - 5 = 2 more trees.
4. The cost for 2 trees is 2 * ₣12 = ₣24.
5. Since she is buying more than 3 trees in total (5 existing + 2 new = 7), she qualifies for a ₣6 discount. Therefore, the total cost is ₣24 - ₣6 = ₣18.

[Example Input]
Question: Sarah has a garden that is 100 meters long. She wants to plant trees that are 2 meters wide and needs to leave 5 meters between each tree. Sarah already has 3 trees. If each tree costs ₣10, how much will Sarah spend to fill her garden with trees?

Wrong answer: I calculated that Sarah can fit 20 trees in her garden, so I multiplied 20 by ₣10 and got ₣200. I forgot to account for the space needed between the trees.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of trees that could fit in the garden because I did not consider the spacing required between each tree. I only calculated the width of the trees without including the gaps.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Spacing
- Budgeting

Instructions:
1. Determine the total length available for planting (subtract the width of the existing trees from the total length).
2. Calculate the total space each tree occupies (tree width + space between trees).
3. Divide the available length by the total space each tree occupies to find the maximum number of trees that can fit.
4. Subtract the number of existing trees from the maximum number to find how many more trees need to be purchased.
5. Calculate the total cost based on the number of trees to be purchased, applying any discounts if applicable.

Advice:
- Always account for both the width of the items being placed and the required spacing between them.
- Double-check calculations to ensure all factors are considered.
- Be mindful of any discounts or special pricing that may affect the total cost.

Solution:
To solve the problem, first, calculate the total space each tree occupies: 2 meters (tree width) + 5 meters (space) = 7 meters. The total length available for planting is 100 meters - (3 trees * 2 meters) = 94 meters. The maximum number of trees that can fit is 94 meters / 7 meters = 13.42, so 13 trees can fit. Since Sarah already has 3 trees, she needs to buy 10 more trees. The cost for 10 trees is 10 * ₣10 = ₣100. Since she is buying more than 2 trees, she receives a ₣5 discount, making the total cost ₣95.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not properly calculate the total space each plant occupies, including the required spacing between them. I mistakenly assumed that the cost could be calculated without considering how many plants could actually fit in the flower bed.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Spacing
- Budgeting

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the total space each plant occupies**: 
   - Each plant is 3 meters wide, and there is a 12-meter gap between each plant. Therefore, the total space each plant occupies is:
     \[
     \text{Total space per plant} = \text{Width of plant} + \text{Space between plants} = 3 \text{ meters} + 12 \text{ meters} = 15 \text{ meters}
     \]

2. **Determine the total length available for planting**: 
   - Olga already has 7 flowers, which occupy:
     \[
     \text{Space occupied by existing flowers} = 7 \text{ flowers} \times 3 \text{ meters/flower} = 21 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - The remaining length available for planting is:
     \[
     \text{Available length} = 132 \text{ meters} - 21 \text{ meters} = 111 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the maximum number of plants that can fit**: 
   - To find out how many plants can fit in the available length, divide the available length by the total space each plant occupies:
     \[
     \text{Maximum number of plants} = \frac{111 \text{ meters}}{15 \text{ meters/plant}} \approx 7.4
     \]
   - Since we can only have whole plants, Olga can fit 7 additional plants.

4. **Calculate the total number of plants Olga will have**: 
   - The total number of plants after purchasing is:
     \[
     \text{Total plants} = 7 \text{ existing plants} + 7 \text{ new plants} = 14 \text{ plants}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost**: 
   - The cost for 14 plants is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 14 \text{ plants} \times ₣9/\text{plant} = ₣126
     \]
   - Since Olga is buying more than 2 plants, she receives a ₣5 discount:
     \[
     \text{Final cost} = ₣126 - ₣5 = ₣121
     \]

### Final Answer:
Olga will spend ₣121 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

### Instructions for Future Problems:
1. Carefully read the problem to identify all dimensions and spacing requirements.
2. Calculate the total space each item occupies, including any required gaps.
3. Determine how much space is already occupied by existing items.
4. Calculate the remaining space available for new items.
5. Divide the available space by the total space each item occupies to find the maximum number of new items that can fit.
6. Add the number of existing items to the number of new items to find the total.
7. Calculate the total cost based on the number of items and apply any discounts as necessary.

### General Advice for Similar Problems:
- Always account for both the size of the items and the required spacing when calculating how many can fit in a given area.
- Double-check your calculations to ensure that all factors are considered, especially when it comes to existing items and their space.
- Be mindful of any discounts or special pricing that may affect the total cost, and apply them correctly to the final calculation.","--- Beginning of the template ---

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,Olga can peel 6 clams a minute and saute 30 clams in 19 minutes. How many minutes will it take her to peel and saute 150 clams if it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam before peeling it? Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.,163.0,"To determine how long it will take Olga to peel and sauté 150 clams, we need to break down the tasks into their respective times and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the time to wash the clams
Olga needs to wash each clam before peeling it, and it takes 12 seconds to wash one clam. 

For 150 clams:
\[
\text{Time to wash} = 150 \text{ clams} \times 12 \text{ seconds/clam} = 1800 \text{ seconds}
\]

Convert seconds to minutes:
\[
1800 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time to peel the clams
Olga can peel 6 clams per minute. 

For 150 clams:
\[
\text{Time to peel} = \frac{150 \text{ clams}}{6 \text{ clams/minute}} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the break time
After peeling, Olga takes a 13-minute break.

### Step 4: Calculate the time to sauté the clams
Olga can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes. 

To find out how long it takes to sauté 150 clams, we first determine how many batches of 30 clams are in 150 clams:
\[
\text{Number of batches} = \frac{150 \text{ clams}}{30 \text{ clams/batch}} = 5 \text{ batches}
\]

Now, calculate the total time to sauté 150 clams:
\[
\text{Time to sauté} = 5 \text{ batches} \times 19 \text{ minutes/batch} = 95 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 5: Total time calculation
Now, we sum all the times:
- Time to wash: 30 minutes
- Time to peel: 25 minutes
- Break time: 13 minutes
- Time to sauté: 95 minutes

Total time:
\[
\text{Total time} = 30 + 25 + 13 + 95 = 163 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it will take Olga a total of **163 minutes** to wash, peel, take a break, and sauté 150 clams.",150.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the time to wash 150 clams:**
   - It takes 12 seconds to wash each clam.
   - For 150 clams, the total washing time is:
     \[
     150 \text{ clams} \times 12 \text{ seconds/clam} = 1800 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Convert seconds to minutes:
     \[
     1800 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time to peel 150 clams:**
   - Olga can peel 6 clams a minute.
   - The time to peel 150 clams is:
     \[
     150 \text{ clams} \div 6 \text{ clams/minute} = 25 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Add the washing and peeling time:**
   - Total time for washing and peeling:
     \[
     30 \text{ minutes (washing)} + 25 \text{ minutes (peeling)} = 55 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Add the break time after peeling:**
   - After peeling, Olga takes a 13-minute break:
     \[
     55 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 68 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Calculate the time to sauté 150 clams:**
   - It takes 19 minutes to sauté 30 clams.
   - To find the time to sauté 150 clams, first determine how many batches of 30 clams are in 150 clams:
     \[
     150 \text{ clams} \div 30 \text{ clams/batch} = 5 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - The total time to sauté 150 clams is:
     \[
     5 \text{ batches} \times 19 \text{ minutes/batch} = 95 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Add the sautéing time to the total time:**
   - Total time including washing, peeling, break, and sautéing:
     \[
     68 \text{ minutes} + 95 \text{ minutes} = 163 \text{ minutes}
     \]

1. **Pineapples picked on each day:**
   - Saturday: 177 pineapples
   - Sunday: 183 pineapples
   - Monday: Double the amount picked on Saturday:
     \[
     \text{Monday's pineapples} = 2 \times 177 = 354 \text{ pineapples}
     \]

2. **Total pineapples picked from Saturday to Monday:**
   \[
   \text{Total from Saturday to Monday} = 177 + 183 + 354

   Calculating this:
   \[
   177 + 183 = 360
   \]
   \[
   360 + 354 = 714
   \]

3. **Pineapples picked on Tuesday:**
   - Tuesday: Half of the total from the past 3 days:
   \[
   \text{Tuesday's pineapples} = \frac{714}{2} = 357 \text{ pineapples}
   \]

4. **Total pineapples picked from Saturday to Tuesday:**
   \[

   51 \times 8 = 408
   \]

Therefore, Andre is going to make **$408**.",408.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. On Saturday, Andre picks 177 pineapples.
2. On Sunday, he picks 183 pineapples.
3. On Monday, he picks double the number of pineapples he did on Saturday:
   - So, on Monday, he picks 2 * 177 = 354 pineapples.
4. Now, let's calculate the total number of pineapples picked over the three days:
   - Total = 177 (Saturday) + 183 (Sunday) + 354 (Monday) = 714 pineapples.
5. On Tuesday, he picks half the amount of what he picked in the past 3 days combined:
   - So, on Tuesday, he picks 714 / 2 = 357 pineapples.
6. Now, let's calculate the total number of pineapples Andre has after Tuesday:
   - Total pineapples = 714 (from the first three days) + 357 (Tuesday) = 1071 pineapples.
7. On Wednesday, he is going to sell pineapples in boxes of 21 pineapples each:
   - The number of boxes he can sell = 1071 / 21 = 51 boxes (since 1071 divided by 21 equals 51 with no remainder).
8. Each box is sold for $8:
   - Total money made = 51 boxes * $8 = $408.

1. **Calculate the number of chemistry questions:**
   \[
   \text{Number of chemistry questions} = 40\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of geography questions:**
   \[
   \text{Number of geography questions} = 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20

3. **Calculate the number of history and algebra questions:**
   The remaining percentage for history and algebra is:
   \[
   100\% - 40\% - 20\% = 40\%

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 50% for the second half. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?",1755.0,"To find out how many pizzas the family eats in two months, we will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate Daily Pizza Consumption

1. **Uncle's consumption**: 10 pizzas per day
2. **Spouse's consumption**: 20 pizzas per day
3. **Combined consumption of uncle and spouse**:
   \[
   10 + 20 = 30 \text{ pizzas per day}
   \]
4. **Grandchild's consumption**: The grandchild eats two-fourths (or 1/2) of the combined number of pizzas:
   \[
   \text{Grandchild's consumption} = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ pizzas per day}
   \]
5. **Total daily consumption of the family**:
   \[
   10 + 20 + 15 = 45 \text{ pizzas per day}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Monthly Consumption

1. **Total days in a month**: 30 days
2. **Total consumption in one month**:
   \[
   45 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 1350 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate Consumption in the Second Month

#### First Half of the Month (15 days)

1. **Reduction in consumption**: 60%
2. **New consumption**:
   \[
   45 \text{ pizzas} \times (1 - 0.60) = 45 \times 0.40 = 18 \text{ pizzas per day}
   \]
3. **Total for the first half of the month**:
   \[
   18 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 270 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

#### Second Half of the Month (15 days)

1. **Reduction in consumption**: 50% (on the already reduced amount)
2. **New consumption**:
   \[
   18 \text{ pizzas} \times (1 - 0.50) = 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \text{ pizzas per day}
   \]
3. **Total for the second half of the month**:
   \[
   9 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

### Step 4: Total Consumption in the Second Month

1. **Total for the second month**:
   \[
   270 \text{ pizzas (first half)} + 135 \text{ pizzas (second half)} = 405 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

### Step 5: Total Consumption Over Two Months

1. **Total for both months**:
   \[
   1350 \text{ pizzas (first month)} + 405 \text{ pizzas (second month)} = 1755 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

Thus, the total number of pizzas the family eats in two months is \(\boxed{1755}\).",1755.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily pizza consumption:**

   - The spouse eats 20 pizzas per day.
   - The total pizzas eaten by the uncle and spouse is:
     \[
     10 + 20 = 30 \text{ pizzas}
     \]
   - The grandchild eats two-fourths (which is the same as one-half) of the combined number of pizzas eaten by the uncle and spouse:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ pizzas}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total daily pizza consumption for the family is:
     \[
     30 + 15 = 45 \text{ pizzas}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total pizza consumption for the first month:**
   - There are 30 days in a month.
   - The total pizzas eaten in the first month is:
     \[
     45 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 1350 \text{ pizzas}
     \]

3. **Calculate the pizza consumption for the second month:**
   - For the first half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by 60%:
     - The reduced consumption is:
     \[
     45 \times (1 - 0.60) = 45 \times 0.40 = 18 \text{ pizzas/day}
     \]
     - The total for the first half of the month is:
     \[
     18 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 270 \text{ pizzas}

After accounting for the 700 seats for graduate, 450 seats for the faculty attending, and reserving 50 seats for the event's staff, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?",12.0,"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive to give to their friends and family, we first need to determine how many seats are available for guests after accounting for the seats reserved for graduates, faculty, and staff.

1. **Total capacity of the Sports Arena**: 9600 seats
2. **Seats reserved for graduates**: 700 seats
3. **Seats reserved for faculty**: 450 seats
4. **Seats reserved for staff**: 50 seats

Now, we can calculate the total number of seats that are reserved:

\[
\text{Total reserved seats} = \text{Seats for graduates} + \text{Seats for faculty} + \text{Seats for staff}
\]
\[
\text{Total reserved seats} = 700 + 450 + 50 = 1200 \text{ seats}

Next, we subtract the total reserved seats from the total capacity to find the number of seats available for guests:

\[
\text{Available seats for guests} = \text{Total capacity} - \text{Total reserved seats}
\]
\[
\text{Available seats for guests} = 9600 - 1200 = 8400 \text{ seats}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many tickets each graduate can receive. Since there are 700 graduates, we divide the available seats by the number of graduates:

\[
\text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{\text{Available seats for guests}}{\text{Number of graduates}}
\]
\[
\text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{8400}{700} = 12

Thus, each graduate would receive **12 tickets** to give to their friends and family.",12.0,1,"Let's think step by step.  
The Sports Arena has a total capacity of 9600 people.  
First, we need to account for the seats that are already reserved:  
- Seats for graduates: 700  
- Seats for faculty: 450  
- Seats for event staff: 50  

Now, let's add these reserved seats together:  
700 + 450 + 50 = 1200 reserved seats.  

Next, we subtract the reserved seats from the total capacity to find out how many seats are available for tickets:  
9600 - 1200 = 8400 available seats.  

Now, we need to determine how many graduates there are. Since each graduate can give tickets to their friends and family, we need to know how many graduates there are. Assuming there are 700 graduates (as indicated by the reserved seats), we can now calculate how many tickets each graduate would receive:  
8400 available seats / 700 graduates = 12 tickets per graduate.

From the rest, Mohammed can only respond to 2 less than the 1/2 of them. How many emails does Mohammed respond to in a 6 day work week? Mohammed work overtime on the last day so he can respond to 10% more emails than usual.",61.0,"To find out how many emails Mohammed responds to in a 6-day work week, we can break the problem down into steps.

1. **Calculate the number of emails that require a response each day:**
   - Mohammed receives 30 emails a day.
   - 20% of those emails don't require a response.
   - The number of emails that don't require a response is:
     \[
     0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ emails}
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of emails that require a response is:
     \[
     30 - 6 = 24 \text{ emails}
     \]

2. **Determine how many emails Mohammed can respond to:**
   - Mohammed can respond to 2 less than half of the emails that require a response.
   - Half of the emails that require a response is:
     \[
     \frac{24}{2} = 12

On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?",85.0,"To solve the problem, we need to determine Ananya's walking speeds and the time she spends on each part of her walk.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( r \) be Ananya's original speed on the beach (in miles per hour).
   - Then her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2r \) (since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk).

2. **Injury Impact:**
   - After her injury, her speed on the beach becomes \( \frac{r}{2} \).
   - Her speed on the sidewalk becomes \( \frac{2r}{2} = r \).

3. **Time Spent on the Beach:**
   - We know that Ananya spends 50 minutes walking on the beach. We need to convert this time into hours for consistency with the speed units:
   \[
   \text{Time on the beach} = \frac{50}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{5}{6} \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Distance on the Beach:**
   - The distance she walks on the beach is 10 miles. Using the formula \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \), we can find her speed on the beach:
   \[
   10 = \left(\frac{r}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)
   \]
   - Solving for \( r \):
   \[
   10 = \frac{5r}{12}
   \]
   \[
   120 = 5r
   \]
   \[
   r = 24 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

5. **Speed After Injury:**
   - After her injury, her speed on the beach is:
   \[
   \frac{r}{2} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]
   - Her speed on the sidewalk is:
   \[
   r = 24 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

6. **Time Spent on the Sidewalk:**
   - The distance she walks on the sidewalk is 14 miles. We can find the time spent on the sidewalk using the speed:
   \[
   \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{14}{24} \text{ hours}
   \]
   - Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{14}{24} \times 60 = \frac{14 \times 60}{24} = \frac{840}{24} = 35 \text{ minutes}
   \]

7. **Total Time for the Walk:**
   - Now, we can find the total time for the entire 24-mile walk:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time on the beach} + \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 50 \text{ minutes} + 35 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Ananya to complete the entire 24-mile walk is \( \boxed{85} \) minutes.",85.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Ananya walks a total of 24 miles every day, which includes 10 miles on the beach and 14 miles on the sidewalk.

2. We know that Ananya spends 50 minutes walking on the beach. 

3. Let's find her speed on the beach. Since she walks 10 miles in 50 minutes, we can calculate her speed on the beach:
   - Speed on the beach = Distance / Time = 10 miles / (50 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) = 10 miles / (5/6 hours) = 10 * (6/5) = 12 miles per hour.

4. Since Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, her original speed on the sidewalk would be:
   - Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * Speed on the beach = 2 * 12 miles per hour = 24 miles per hour.

5. However, due to her injury, her speed has decreased by half. Therefore, her current speeds are:
   - Speed on the beach = 12 miles per hour / 2 = 6 miles per hour.
   - Speed on the sidewalk = 24 miles per hour / 2 = 12 miles per hour.

6. Now, let's calculate the time it takes for her to walk the 14 miles on the sidewalk:
   - Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 14 miles / 12 miles per hour = 14 / 12 hours = 7/6 hours.

7. To convert this time into minutes:
   - Time on the sidewalk in minutes = (7/6 hours) * 60 minutes/hour = 70 minutes.

8. Now, we can find the total time for her entire 24-mile walk:
   - Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk = 50 minutes + 70 minutes = 120 minutes.

Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

[Example Input]
Question: Sarah jogs 30 miles every week, which includes 12 miles on a trail and 18 miles on the road. On the road, Sarah jogs at three times the speed she does on the trail. After an injury, her speed has decreased to two-thirds of her original speed on both the trail and the road. If she spends 40 minutes jogging on the trail, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 30-mile jog, in minutes?
Wrong answer: I calculated that Sarah took 60 minutes to complete her jog by assuming her speed on the trail was the same as on the road and not accounting for her decreased speed after the injury.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total time by not properly adjusting for Sarah's decreased speed on both the trail and the road. I also failed to correctly calculate the time spent on the road based on the distance and speed.

Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding speed adjustment
- Incorrect time calculation
- Failure to differentiate speeds

Instructions:
1. Identify the total distance and the distances covered on different terrains.
2. Determine the speed for each terrain before and after the injury.
3. Calculate the time spent on each terrain using the formula: time = distance/speed.
4. Add the time spent on each terrain to find the total time for the jog.
5. Double-check calculations to ensure all adjustments for speed changes are included.

Advice:
- Always account for changes in speed due to injuries or other factors.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion.
- Use the distance, rate, and time relationship to set up equations clearly.
- Review the problem to ensure all conditions are met before finalizing the answer.

Solution:
To find the time Sarah takes to complete her jog, first calculate her speed on the trail and road before the injury. If her trail speed is x, then her road speed is 3x. After the injury, her speeds become (2/3)x and 2x, respectively. The time spent on the trail is 40 minutes, which is (12 miles) / ((2/3)x) = 40 minutes. This gives us x = 6 miles/hour. Therefore, her road speed is 18 miles/hour. The time on the road is (18 miles) / (18 miles/hour) = 1 hour. The total time is 40 minutes + 60 minutes = 100 minutes. Thus, Sarah takes 100 minutes to complete her jog.

Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 120.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly by not properly adjusting Ananya's speed after her injury. I also miscalculated the time spent on the sidewalk based on the incorrect speed assumptions. I failed to account for the relationship between the distances and speeds on the beach and sidewalk correctly.

### Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding speed adjustment
- Incorrect time calculation
- Failure to differentiate speeds

### Solution:
1. **Identify the distances and speeds:**
   - Distance on the beach: 10 miles
   - Distance on the sidewalk: 14 miles
   - Total distance: 24 miles

2. **Define the speeds:**
   - Let Ananya's original speed on the beach be \( x \) miles per hour.
   - Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2x \) miles per hour.
   - After her injury, her speed on the beach becomes \( \frac{x}{2} \) and on the sidewalk becomes \( x \).

3. **Calculate the time spent on the beach:**
   - Given that she spends 50 minutes on the beach, we can convert this to hours: 
     \[
     \text{Time on beach} = \frac{50}{60} = \frac{5}{6} \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Using the formula \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \):
     \[
     \frac{5}{6} = \frac{10}{\frac{x}{2}} \implies \frac{5}{6} = \frac{20}{x} \implies 5x = 120 \implies x = 24 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]

4. **Calculate the speeds after the injury:**
   - Speed on the beach after injury: 
     \[
     \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]
   - Speed on the sidewalk after injury: 
     \[
     24 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]

5. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Using the sidewalk distance of 14 miles:
     \[
     \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{14}{24} = \frac{7}{12} \text{ hours}
     \]

6. **Convert the time on the sidewalk to minutes:**
   - Convert \( \frac{7}{12} \) hours to minutes:
     \[
     \frac{7}{12} \times 60 = 35 \text{ minutes}
     \]

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 50 \text{ minutes} + 35 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Ananya takes **85 minutes** to complete her entire 24-mile walk.

[Example Input]
Question: Sarah jogs 30 miles every week, which includes 12 miles on a trail and 18 miles on the road. On the road, Sarah jogs at three times the speed she does on the trail. After an injury, her speed has decreased to two-thirds of her original speed on both the trail and the road. If she spends 40 minutes jogging on the trail, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 30-mile jog, in minutes?
Wrong answer: I calculated that Sarah took 60 minutes to complete her jog by assuming her speed on the trail was the same as on the road and not accounting for her decreased speed after the injury.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total time by not properly adjusting for Sarah's decreased speed on both the trail and the road. I also failed to correctly calculate the time spent on the road based on the distance and speed.

Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding speed adjustment
- Incorrect time calculation
- Failure to differentiate speeds

Instructions:
1. Identify the total distance and the distances covered on different terrains.
2. Determine the speed for each terrain before and after the injury.
3. Calculate the time spent on each terrain using the formula: time = distance/speed.
4. Add the time spent on each terrain to find the total time for the jog.
5. Double-check calculations to ensure all adjustments for speed changes are included.

Advice:
- Always account for changes in speed due to injuries or other factors.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion.
- Use the distance, rate, and time relationship to set up equations clearly.
- Review the problem to ensure all conditions are met before finalizing the answer.

Solution:
To find the time Sarah takes to complete her jog, first calculate her speed on the trail and road before the injury. If her trail speed is x, then her road speed is 3x. After the injury, her speeds become (2/3)x and 2x, respectively. The time spent on the trail is 40 minutes, which is (12 miles) / ((2/3)x) = 40 minutes. This gives us x = 6 miles/hour. Therefore, her road speed is 18 miles/hour. The time on the road is (18 miles) / (18 miles/hour) = 1 hour. The total time is 40 minutes + 60 minutes = 100 minutes. Thus, Sarah takes 100 minutes to complete her jog.

Elena finds 5 cookies. Mei finds twice as many as Elena. Xavier finds 2 less than Mei. Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier, and Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined. How many cookies are still hidden in the yard?",64.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of cookies**: Amelia had 11 dozen cookies.
   \[
   11 \text{ dozen} = 11 \times 12 = 132 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. **Cookies eaten by Amelia**: She ate 5 cookies for breakfast.
   \[
   132 - 5 = 127 \text{ cookies left}
   \]

3. **Cookies found by Elena**: Elena finds 5 cookies.
   \[
   \text{Elena's cookies} = 5
   \]

4. **Cookies found by Mei**: Mei finds twice as many as Elena.
   \[
   \text{Mei's cookies} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

5. **Cookies found by Xavier**: Xavier finds 2 less than Mei.
   \[
   \text{Xavier's cookies} = 10 - 2 = 8
   \]

6. **Cookies found by Mohammed**: Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier.
   \[
   \text{Mohammed's cookies} = \frac{8}{8} = 1
   \]

7. **Cookies found by Umar**: Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined.
   - First, calculate the total cookies found by Mei and Elena:
   \[
   \text{Mei's cookies} + \text{Elena's cookies} = 10 + 5 = 15
   \]
   - Now, calculate Umar's cookies:
   \[
   \text{Umar's cookies} = 15 + 2 \times 12 = 15 + 24 = 39
   \]

8. **Total cookies found**: Now, we sum up all the cookies found by each person:
   \[
   \text{Total found} = \text{Elena's cookies} + \text{Mei's cookies} + \text{Xavier's cookies} + \text{Mohammed's cookies} + \text{Umar's cookies}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total found} = 5 + 10 + 8 + 1 + 39 = 63
   \]

9. **Cookies still hidden in the yard**: Finally, we subtract the total cookies found from the number of cookies Amelia had left after eating.
   \[
   \text{Cookies still hidden} = 127 - 63 = 64
   \]

Thus, the number of cookies still hidden in the yard is \(\boxed{64}\).",64.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Amelia initially had 11 dozen cookies. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we calculate the total number of cookies:
   \[
   11 \text{ dozen} = 11 \times 12 = 132 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. Amelia ate 5 cookies for breakfast. We subtract the cookies she ate from the total:
   \[
   132 - 5 = 127 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. Now, 127 cookies are hidden in the yard.

4. Elena finds 5 cookies. We note that:
   \[
   \text{Elena's cookies} = 5
   \]

5. Mei finds twice as many cookies as Elena:
   \[
   \text{Mei's cookies} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

6. Xavier finds 2 less than Mei:
   \[
   \text{Xavier's cookies} = 10 - 2 = 8
   \]

7. Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier:
   \[
   \text{Mohammed's cookies} = \frac{8}{8} = 1
   \]

8. Now, we calculate how many cookies Mei and Elena found combined:
   \[
   \text{Mei's cookies} + \text{Elena's cookies} = 10 + 5 = 15
   \]

9. Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Umar's cookies} = 15 + 2 \times 12 = 15 + 24 = 39
   \]

10. Now, we add up all the cookies found:
    \[
    \text{Total cookies found} = \text{Elena's cookies} + \text{Mei's cookies} + \text{Xavier's cookies} + \text{Mohammed's cookies} + \text{Umar's cookies}
    \]
    \[
    = 5 + 10 + 8 + 1 + 39 = 63

11. Finally, we subtract the total cookies found from the number of cookies initially hidden in the yard:
    \[
    \text{Cookies still hidden} = 127 - 63 = 64

How much money does he make in a week?",1243.0,"To calculate how much money Oscar makes in a week, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of apartments in each complex.**
   - The first two complexes each have 100 apartments.
   - The total number of apartments in the first two complexes is:
     \[
     100 + 100 = 200 \text{ apartments}
     \]
   - The last complex is 35% bigger than the first two combined. Therefore, the number of apartments in the last complex is:
     \[
     200 + (0.35 \times 200) = 200 + 70 = 270 \text{ apartments}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of apartments Oscar services.**
   - The total number of apartments across all three complexes is:
     \[
     200 + 270 = 470 \text{ apartments}
     \]

3. **Account for the vacant apartments.**
   - There are 9 vacant apartments in each of the first two complexes, so the total number of vacant apartments is:
     \[
     9 + 9 = 18 \text{ vacant apartments}
     \]
   - The number of apartments that require collection service is:
     \[
     470 - 18 = 452 \text{ apartments}

2. **Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex:**
   - The third complex is 35% bigger than the first two combined.
   - The size of the first two combined is 200 apartments.
   - 35% of 200 = 0.35 * 200 = 70 apartments.
   - Therefore, the third complex has 200 + 70 = 270 apartments.

3. **Calculate the total number of apartments:**
   - Total apartments = 200 (first two complexes) + 270 (third complex) = 470 apartments.

4. **Account for the vacant apartments:**
   - Each of the first two complexes has 9 vacant apartments.
   - Total vacant apartments = 9 + 9 = 18 apartments.
   - Therefore, the number of apartments requiring collection service = 470 - 18 = 452 apartments.

5. **Calculate the number of collections per week:**
   - Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each apartment.
   - Total collections = 452 apartments * 5 collections = 2260 collections.

6. **Calculate the earnings from collections:**
   - Oscar earns ₣0.5 per collection.

Question: A gardener has to plant 120 trees in a park. They have 15 days to complete the task. It takes them 5 minutes to plant each tree. However, due to a recent illness, they can only plant trees at half the speed, taking 10 minutes per tree now. If they work for 6 hours a day, what percentage of their day is spent planting trees?

Wrong answer: I calculated that the gardener spends 50% of their day planting trees. I miscalculated the total time needed and did not account for the reduced speed properly.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total time needed to plant the trees by not considering the increased time per tree due to the illness. I also failed to convert the working hours into minutes correctly.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Time management
- Speed adjustment

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total time needed to plant all trees at the new speed (number of trees × time per tree).
2. Convert the total working hours per day into minutes (hours × 60).
3. Determine the percentage of the day spent planting trees by dividing the total planting time by the total available working time and multiplying by 100.

Advice:
- Always double-check the time adjustments when conditions change (like speed).
- Convert all time units to the same format (e.g., minutes) before performing calculations.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid missing critical steps.

Solution:
The gardener needs 120 trees × 10 minutes/tree = 1200 minutes to plant all trees. They work for 6 hours/day = 360 minutes/day. The percentage of their day spent planting trees is (1200 minutes / 360 minutes) × 100 = 333.33%. Since this exceeds 100%, it indicates they cannot complete the task in the given time frame.

[Example Input]
Question: A gardener has to plant 120 trees in a park. They have 15 days to complete the task. It takes them 5 minutes to plant each tree. However, due to a recent illness, they can only plant trees at half the speed, taking 10 minutes per tree now. If they work for 6 hours a day, what percentage of their day is spent planting trees?

Wrong answer: I calculated that the gardener spends 50% of their day planting trees. I miscalculated the total time needed and did not account for the reduced speed properly.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total time needed to plant the trees by not considering the increased time per tree due to the illness. I also failed to convert the working hours into minutes correctly.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Time management
- Speed adjustment

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total time needed to plant all trees at the new speed (number of trees × time per tree).
2. Convert the total working hours per day into minutes (hours × 60).
3. Determine the percentage of the day spent planting trees by dividing the total planting time by the total available working time and multiplying by 100.

Advice:
- Always double-check the time adjustments when conditions change (like speed).
- Convert all time units to the same format (e.g., minutes) before performing calculations.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid missing critical steps.

Solution:
The gardener needs 120 trees × 10 minutes/tree = 1200 minutes to plant all trees. They work for 6 hours/day = 360 minutes/day. The percentage of their day spent planting trees is (1200 minutes / 360 minutes) × 100 = 333.33%. Since this exceeds 100%, it indicates they cannot complete the task in the given time frame.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Noah is popping popcorn for a snack. As the skillet of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 70 pop in the first 10 seconds of cooking, then 2 times that amount in the next 10 seconds. The kernels increase to 4 times the initial popping rate in the next 10 seconds. In the final 10 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 10 seconds. After Noah takes the skillet off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. Noah gives one-fifth of the made popcorn to his brother Luca. How many more pieces of popcorn does Noah have to eat than his brother?",399.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Popping in the first 10 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels popped = 70

2. **Popping in the second 10 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels popped = 2 times the first 10 seconds = \(2 \times 70 = 140\)

3. **Popping in the third 10 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels popped = 4 times the first 10 seconds = \(4 \times 70 = 280\)

4. **Popping in the fourth 10 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels popped = half the rate of the previous 10 seconds = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 280 = 140\)

5. **Total kernels popped during the cooking:**
   - Total = \(70 + 140 + 280 + 140\)
   - Total = \(630\)

6. **Kernels that pop from residual heat:**
   - Number of kernels popped = a quarter of the final 10 seconds = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 140 = 35\)

7. **Total kernels popped (including residual heat):**
   - Total = \(630 + 35 = 665\)

8. **Popcorn given to Luca:**
   - Noah gives one-fifth of the total popcorn to Luca = \(\frac{1}{5} \times 665 = 133\)

9. **Popcorn Noah has left:**
   - Noah's remaining popcorn = Total - Popcorn given to Luca = \(665 - 133 = 532\)

10. **Difference in popcorn between Noah and Luca:**
    - Difference = Noah's popcorn - Luca's popcorn = \(532 - 133 = 399\)

Thus, Noah has **399 more pieces of popcorn** to eat than his brother Luca.",399.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. In the first 10 seconds, 70 kernels pop.
2. In the next 10 seconds, the amount that pops is 2 times the first amount:
   - 2 * 70 = 140 kernels.
3. In the following 10 seconds, the popping rate increases to 4 times the initial rate:
   - 4 * 70 = 280 kernels.
4. In the final 10 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate of the previous 10 seconds:
   - Half of 280 = 280 / 2 = 140 kernels.
5. Now, let's calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the cooking:
   - Total popped = 70 + 140 + 280 + 140 = 630 kernels.
6. After cooking, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds also pop from the residual heat:
   - A quarter of 140 = 140 / 4 = 35 kernels.
7. Now, let's find the total number of kernels that popped including the residual heat:
   - Total popped including residual = 630 + 35 = 665 kernels.
8. Noah gives one-fifth of the made popcorn to his brother Luca:
   - One-fifth of 665 = 665 / 5 = 133 kernels.
9. To find out how many more pieces of popcorn Noah has than his brother, we subtract the amount Luca received from the total:
   - Noah's popcorn = 665 - 133 = 532 kernels.
10. Finally, we calculate how many more pieces Noah has than Luca:
    - Difference = 532 - 133 = 399 kernels.

The answer is 399.",399.0,1,0,1,399.0,,,
p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"A building is made out of 5 white bricks, twice as many orange bricks, and an unknown number of green bricks. If there are 30 bricks in the building in total, what percentage of bricks are green?",50.0,"To find the percentage of green bricks in the building, we first need to determine the number of each type of brick.

1. **Identify the number of white bricks:**
   - There are 5 white bricks.

2. **Determine the number of orange bricks:**
   - The problem states there are twice as many orange bricks as white bricks. Therefore, the number of orange bricks is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ orange bricks}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of white and orange bricks:**
   - The total number of white and orange bricks is:
   \[
   5 \text{ (white)} + 10 \text{ (orange)} = 15 \text{ bricks}
   \]

4. **Find the total number of bricks in the building:**
   - The total number of bricks in the building is given as 30.

5. **Calculate the number of green bricks:**
   - To find the number of green bricks, we subtract the total number of white and orange bricks from the total number of bricks:
   \[
   30 \text{ (total)} - 15 \text{ (white and orange)} = 15 \text{ green bricks}
   \]

6. **Calculate the percentage of green bricks:**
   - The percentage of green bricks is calculated by dividing the number of green bricks by the total number of bricks and then multiplying by 100:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of green bricks} = \left( \frac{15 \text{ (green)}}{30 \text{ (total)}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
   \]

Thus, the percentage of bricks that are green is \( \boxed{50\%} \).",50.0,1,"Let's think step by step.  
1. The building has 5 white bricks.  
2. It has twice as many orange bricks as white bricks, so the number of orange bricks is 2 * 5 = 10.  
3. Now, we can find the total number of white and orange bricks: 5 (white) + 10 (orange) = 15 bricks.  
4. The total number of bricks in the building is 30.  
5. To find the number of green bricks, we subtract the number of white and orange bricks from the total: 30 - 15 = 15 green bricks.  
6. Now, we need to find the percentage of green bricks. The formula for percentage is (part/whole) * 100. Here, the part is the number of green bricks (15) and the whole is the total number of bricks (30).  
7. So, the percentage of green bricks is (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.

Olivia, who is younger than Bodhi but older than Keisha, will be 42 in 7 years. How much younger is Keisha than the average age of all three?",18.0,"Let's denote the current ages of Olivia, Bodhi, and Keisha as \( O \), \( B \), and \( K \) respectively.

1. **Determine Olivia's current age**:
   Since Olivia will be 42 in 7 years, we can find her current age:
   \[
   O + 7 = 42 \implies O = 42 - 7 = 35
   \]

2. **Determine Bodhi's current age**:
   We know that Olivia and Bodhi are currently 24 years apart, and since Olivia is younger than Bodhi:
   \[
   B - O = 24 \implies B - 35 = 24 \implies B = 24 + 35 = 59
   \]

3. **Determine Keisha's current age**:
   We also know that Olivia and Keisha are currently 15 years apart, and since Olivia is older than Keisha:
   \[
   O - K = 15 \implies 35 - K = 15 \implies K = 35 - 15 = 20
   \]

4. **Calculate the average age of all three**:
   Now we can find the average age of Olivia, Bodhi, and Keisha:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{O + B + K}{3} = \frac{35 + 59 + 20}{3} = \frac{114}{3} = 38
   \]

5. **Determine how much younger Keisha is than the average age**:
   Now we find how much younger Keisha is than the average age:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Average age} - K = 38 - 20 = 18
   \]

Thus, Keisha is **18 years younger** than the average age of all three.",18.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine Olivia's current age**: 
   - In 7 years, Olivia will be 42 years old.
   - Therefore, her current age is 42 - 7 = 35 years old.

2. **Determine Bodhi's current age**: 
   - Olivia is currently 24 years younger than Bodhi.
   - So, Bodhi's current age is 35 + 24 = 59 years old.

3. **Determine Keisha's current age**: 
   - Olivia is currently 15 years older than Keisha.
   - Therefore, Keisha's current age is 35 - 15 = 20 years old.

4. **Calculate the average age of Olivia, Bodhi, and Keisha**: 
   - The sum of their ages is 35 (Olivia) + 59 (Bodhi) + 20 (Keisha) = 114 years.
   - There are 3 people, so the average age is 114 / 3 = 38 years.

5. **Determine how much younger Keisha is than the average age**: 
   - The average age is 38 years.
   - Keisha's age is 20 years.
   - The difference is 38 - 20 = 18 years.
