She bought 6 dozen croissants which cost $19 per dozen, 4 dozen macarons which cost $77 per dozen, and 3 dozen brownies for $118 per dozen. How much was the total cost if she received 25% discount on all purchases?",582.0,"To calculate the total cost of Beatriz's purchases after the discount, let's break it down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of each type of baked good before the discount.

1. **Croissants**:
   - Beatriz bought 6 dozen croissants.
   - Each dozen costs $19.
   - Total cost for croissants:
     \[
     6 \times 19 = 114 \, \text{dollars}.
     \]

2. **Macarons**:
   - Beatriz bought 4 dozen macarons.
   - Each dozen costs $77.
   - Total cost for macarons:
     \[
     4 \times 77 = 308 \, \text{dollars}.
     \]

3. **Brownies**:
   - Beatriz bought 3 dozen brownies.
   - Each dozen costs $118.
   - Total cost for brownies:
     \[
     3 \times 118 = 354 \, \text{dollars}.
     \]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost before the discount.

Add up the costs of all the baked goods:
\[
114 + 308 + 354 = 776 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

---

### Step 3: Apply the 25% discount.

The discount is 25% of the total cost. To calculate the discount:
\[
\text{Discount} = 0.25 \times 776 = 194 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

Now subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[
\text{Total cost after discount} = 776 - 194 = 582 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The total cost after the 25% discount is **$582**.",582.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Beatriz bought **6 dozen croissants** at $19 per dozen.  
   The cost of the croissants is:  
   \( 6 \times 19 = 114 \) dollars.

2. Beatriz bought **4 dozen macarons** at $77 per dozen.  
   The cost of the macarons is:  
   \( 4 \times 77 = 308 \) dollars.

3. Beatriz bought **3 dozen brownies** at $118 per dozen.  
   The cost of the brownies is:  
   \( 3 \times 118 = 354 \) dollars.

p1,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"I have 16 liters of mango drink that is one-ninth water and I wish to add it to 14 liters of apple drink that is one-half water. But as I pour it, I spill 7 liters of the mango drink. To make up for that, I add 7 liters of water to the mix. What percentage of the final mix is water?",50.0,"To solve this problem, we will calculate the amount of water in the final mix step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the original mango drink
The mango drink is **16 liters** and is **one-ninth water**. The amount of water in the mango drink is:

\[
\text{Water in mango drink} = \frac{1}{9} \times 16 = \frac{16}{9} \, \text{liters}.
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the apple drink
The apple drink is **14 liters** and is **one-half water**. The amount of water in the apple drink is:

\[
\text{Water in apple drink} = \frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7 \, \text{liters}.
\]

---

### Step 3: Account for the spilled mango drink
You spill **7 liters** of the mango drink. Since the mango drink is **one-ninth water**, the amount of water spilled is:

\[
\text{Water spilled} = \frac{1}{9} \times 7 = \frac{7}{9} \, \text{liters}.
\]

The remaining mango drink is:

\[
\text{Remaining mango drink} = 16 - 7 = 9 \, \text{liters}.
\]

The amount of water left in the remaining mango drink is:

\[
\text{Water left in mango drink} = \frac{1}{9} \times 9 = 1 \, \text{liter}.
\]

---

### Step 4: Add 7 liters of water
To make up for the spilled mango drink, you add **7 liters of water**. This increases the total amount of water in the mix by **7 liters**.

---

### Step 5: Calculate the total amount of water in the final mix
The total amount of water in the final mix is:

\[
\text{Total water} = \text{Water left in mango drink} + \text{Water in apple drink} + \text{Added water}.
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Total water} = 1 + 7 + 7 = 15 \, \text{liters}.
\]

---

### Step 6: Calculate the total volume of the final mix
The total volume of the final mix is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = \text{Remaining mango drink} + \text{Apple drink} + \text{Added water}.
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 9 + 14 + 7 = 30 \, \text{liters}.
\]

---

### Step 7: Calculate the percentage of water in the final mix
The percentage of water in the final mix is:

\[
\text{Percentage of water} = \left( \frac{\text{Total water}}{\text{Total volume}} \right) \times 100.
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Percentage of water} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\%.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The percentage of water in the final mix is:

\[
\boxed{50\%}.
\]",50.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the mango drink.
The mango drink is **16 liters**, and it is **one-ninth water**.  
The amount of water in the mango drink is:  
\[
\frac{1}{9} \times 16 = \frac{16}{9} \, \text{liters of water}.
\]  
The remaining part of the mango drink is the non-water portion:  
\[
16 - \frac{16}{9} = \frac{144}{9} - \frac{16}{9} = \frac{128}{9} \, \text{liters of non-water}.
\]

### Step 2: Account for the spilled mango drink.
You spill **7 liters** of the mango drink.  
The proportion of water and non-water in the mango drink remains the same.  
The amount of water in the spilled 7 liters is:  
\[
\frac{1}{9} \times 7 = \frac{7}{9} \, \text{liters of water}.
\]  
The amount of non-water in the spilled 7 liters is:  
\[
7 - \frac{7}{9} = \frac{63}{9} - \frac{7}{9} = \frac{56}{9} \, \text{liters of non-water}.
\]

After spilling, the remaining mango drink is:  
\[
16 - 7 = 9 \, \text{liters}.
\]  
The remaining water in the mango drink is:  
\[
\frac{16}{9} - \frac{7}{9} = \frac{9}{9} = 1 \, \text{liter of water}.
\]  
The remaining non-water in the mango drink is:  
\[
\frac{128}{9} - \frac{56}{9} = \frac{72}{9} = 8 \, \text{liters of non-water}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the apple drink.
The apple drink is **14 liters**, and it is **one-half water**.  
The amount of water in the apple drink is:  
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7 \, \text{liters of water}.
\]  
The remaining part of the apple drink is the non-water portion:  
\[
14 - 7 = 7 \, \text{liters of non-water}.
\]

### Step 4: Add 7 liters of water to the mix.
You add **7 liters of water** to the mix.  
This increases the total water content by 7 liters.

### Step 5: Combine everything.
Now, combine the remaining mango drink, the apple drink, and the added water.  
- Total water:  
\[
1 \, \text{(from mango drink)} + 7 \, \text{(from apple drink)} + 7 \, \text{(added water)} = 15 \, \text{liters of water}.
\]  
- Total non-water:  
\[
8 \, \text{(from mango drink)} + 7 \, \text{(from apple drink)} = 15 \, \text{liters of non-water}.
\]  
- Total mix:  
\[
15 \, \text{(water)} + 15 \, \text{(non-water)} = 30 \, \text{liters}.
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the percentage of water.
The percentage of water in the final mix is:  
\[
\frac{\text{water}}{\text{total mix}} \times 100 = \frac{15}{30} \times 100 = 50\%.

p1,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Mei can run four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is 1/2 as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 10 hours if she spends 2/5 of the time running, 1/2 of the time skipping, and the remaining of the time walking?",27.0,"We are tasked with finding how many miles Mei can travel in 10 hours, given her speeds for running, skipping, and walking, and the proportion of time she spends on each activity. Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine Mei's running, skipping, and walking speeds.

We are told:
- Mei can skip at **2 miles per hour**.
- Mei's skipping speed is **1/2 as fast as her running speed**. Therefore, her running speed is:
  \[
  2 \times 2 = 4 \, \text{miles per hour}.
  \]
- Mei's running speed is **4 times faster than her walking speed**. Therefore, her walking speed is:
  \[
  \frac{4}{4} = 1 \, \text{mile per hour}.
  \]

Thus, Mei's speeds are:
- Walking: \(1 \, \text{mile per hour}\),
- Skipping: \(2 \, \text{miles per hour}\),
- Running: \(4 \, \text{miles per hour}\).

---

### Step 2: Determine how much time Mei spends on each activity.

Mei spends a total of 10 hours traveling. The proportions of time spent on each activity are:
- \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the time running,
- \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the time skipping,
- The remaining time walking.

#### Time spent running:
\[
\text{Time running} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10 = 4 \, \text{hours}.
\]

#### Time spent skipping:
\[
\text{Time skipping} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \, \text{hours}.
\]

#### Time spent walking:
The remaining time is:
\[
\text{Time walking} = 10 - (\text{Time running} + \text{Time skipping}) = 10 - (4 + 5) = 1 \, \text{hour}.
\]

Thus, Mei spends:
- 4 hours running,
- 5 hours skipping,
- 1 hour walking.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled for each activity.

#### Distance traveled while running:
\[
\text{Distance running} = \text{Speed running} \times \text{Time running} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \, \text{miles}.
\]

#### Distance traveled while skipping:
\[
\text{Distance skipping} = \text{Speed skipping} \times \text{Time skipping} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \, \text{miles}.
\]

#### Distance traveled while walking:
\[
\text{Distance walking} = \text{Speed walking} \times \text{Time walking} = 1 \times 1 = 1 \, \text{mile}.
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the total distance traveled.

The total distance Mei travels is:
\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance skipping} + \text{Distance walking} = 16 + 10 + 1 = 27 \, \text{miles}.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Mei can travel **27 miles** in 10 hours.",10.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Understand the problem and the given information:**
   - Mei can skip at 2 miles per hour.
   - Mei's skipping speed is 1/2 of her running speed. So, her running speed is \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) miles per hour.
   - Mei's running speed is 4 times her walking speed. So, her walking speed is \( 4 / 4 = 1 \) mile per hour.
   - Mei spends 2/5 of the time running, 1/2 of the time skipping, and the remaining time walking.
   - Mei travels for a total of 10 hours.

2. **Determine how much time Mei spends on each activity:**
   - Mei spends \( 2/5 \) of the 10 hours running:  
     \( 10 \times 2/5 = 4 \) hours running.
   - Mei spends \( 1/2 \) of the 10 hours skipping:  
     \( 10 \times 1/2 = 5 \) hours skipping.
   - The remaining time is spent walking:  
     Total time = 10 hours, time running = 4 hours, time skipping = 5 hours.  
     Time walking = \( 10 - 4 - 5 = 1 \) hour walking.

3. **Calculate the distance traveled for each activity:**
   - Distance running:  
     Running speed = 4 miles per hour, time running = 4 hours.  
     Distance = \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) miles.
   - Distance skipping:  
     Skipping speed = 2 miles per hour, time skipping = 5 hours.  
     Distance = \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) miles.
   - Distance walking:  
     Walking speed = 1 mile per hour, time walking = 1 hour.  
     Distance = \( 1 \times 1 = 1 \) mile.

4. **Add up the total distance traveled:**
   Total distance = Distance running + Distance skipping + Distance walking.  
   Total distance = \( 16 + 10 + 1 = 27 \) miles.

If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?",180.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ounces of cookies you can eat without exceeding your daily calorie target. Let's break it down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Calculate the remaining calories you can consume
Your daily calorie target is **2300 calories**. You have already consumed **1200 calories** and burned **100 calories** through exercise. The remaining calories you can consume are:

\[
2300 - 1200 + 100 = 1200 \, \text{calories}
\]

So, you have **1200 calories** left to consume.

---

### Step 2: Determine the calories per ounce of cookies
The bag of cookies contains **200 calories per serving**, and the entire bag weighs **150 oz** with **5 servings**. First, calculate the weight of one serving:

\[
\text{Weight of one serving} = \frac{150 \, \text{oz}}{5} = 30 \, \text{oz}
\]

Next, calculate the calories per ounce of cookies:

\[
\text{Calories per ounce} = \frac{200 \, \text{calories}}{30 \, \text{oz}} = \frac{20}{3} \, \text{calories per ounce} \approx 6.67 \, \text{calories per ounce}
\]

---

### Step 3: Determine how many ounces of cookies you can eat
You have **1200 calories** left to consume. To find out how many ounces of cookies you can eat, divide the remaining calories by the calories per ounce:

\[
\text{Ounces of cookies} = \frac{1200 \, \text{calories}}{6.67 \, \text{calories per ounce}} \approx 179.9 \, \text{oz}
\]

---

### Step 4: Check if this exceeds the total bag weight
The total bag weight is **150 oz**, so you cannot eat more than that. Since **179.9 oz** exceeds the bag weight, you can eat the entire bag of cookies (150 oz) without exceeding your calorie target.

---

### Final Answer:
You can eat **150 oz** of cookies.",150.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Your daily calorie target is 2300 calories.  
You have already consumed 1200 calories.  
You exercised and burned 100 calories, so the net calories consumed so far is:  
1200 - 100 = 1100 calories.  

This means you have:  
2300 - 1100 = 1200 calories remaining for the day.  

The bag of cookies has 200 calories per serving, and the entire bag (150 oz) contains 5 servings.  
So, the calories per ounce of cookies is:  
200 calories per serving ÷ (150 oz ÷ 5 servings) = 200 ÷ 30 = 6.67 calories per ounce.  

Now, to find how many ounces you can eat with 1200 calories remaining:  
1200 ÷ 6.67 ≈ 179.9 ounces.

Now, look at this question:
Question: According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has 200 calories per serving. If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?
Your initial answer was: Let's think step by step.

Your daily calorie target is 2300 calories.  
You have already consumed 1200 calories.  
You exercised and burned 100 calories, so the net calories consumed so far is:  
1200 - 100 = 1100 calories.  

This means you have:  
2300 - 1100 = 1200 calories remaining for the day.  

The bag of cookies has 200 calories per serving, and the entire bag (150 oz) contains 5 servings.  
So, the calories per ounce of cookies is:  
200 calories per serving ÷ (150 oz ÷ 5 servings) = 200 ÷ 30 = 6.67 calories per ounce.  

Now, to find how many ounces you can eat with 1200 calories remaining:  
1200 ÷ 6.67 ≈ 179.9 ounces.  

So, you can eat approximately **179.9 ounces** of cookies.

If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?",180.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ounces of cookies you can eat without exceeding your daily calorie target. Let's break it down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Calculate the remaining calories you can consume
Your daily calorie target is **2300 calories**. You have already consumed **1200 calories** and burned **100 calories** through exercise. The remaining calories you can consume are:

\[
2300 - 1200 + 100 = 1200 \, \text{calories}
\]

So, you have **1200 calories** left to consume.

---

### Step 2: Determine the calories per ounce of cookies
The bag of cookies contains **200 calories per serving**, and the entire bag weighs **150 oz** with **5 servings**. First, calculate the weight of one serving:

\[
\text{Weight of one serving} = \frac{150 \, \text{oz}}{5} = 30 \, \text{oz}
\]

Next, calculate the calories per ounce of cookies:

\[
\text{Calories per ounce} = \frac{200 \, \text{calories}}{30 \, \text{oz}} = \frac{20}{3} \, \text{calories per ounce} \approx 6.67 \, \text{calories per ounce}
\]

---

### Step 3: Determine how many ounces of cookies you can eat
You have **1200 calories** left to consume. To find out how many ounces of cookies you can eat, divide the remaining calories by the calories per ounce:

\[
\text{Ounces of cookies} = \frac{1200 \, \text{calories}}{6.67 \, \text{calories per ounce}} \approx 179.9 \, \text{oz}
\]

---

### Step 4: Check if this exceeds the total bag weight
The total bag weight is **150 oz**, so you cannot eat more than that. Since **179.9 oz** exceeds the bag weight, you can eat the entire bag of cookies (150 oz) without exceeding your calorie target.

---

### Final Answer:
You can eat **150 oz** of cookies.",150.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Your daily calorie target is 2300 calories.  
You have already consumed 1200 calories.  
You exercised and burned 100 calories, so the net calories consumed so far is:  
1200 - 100 = 1100 calories.  

This means you have:  
2300 - 1100 = 1200 calories remaining for the day.  

The bag of cookies has 200 calories per serving, and the entire bag (150 oz) contains 5 servings.  
So, the calories per ounce of cookies is:  
200 calories per serving ÷ (150 oz ÷ 5 servings) = 200 ÷ 30 = 6.67 calories per ounce.  

Now, to find how many ounces you can eat with 1200 calories remaining:  
1200 ÷ 6.67 ≈ 179.9 ounces.

[Example Input]  
Question: A smoothie contains 150 calories per 8 oz serving. If a 64 oz bottle contains 8 servings, how many ounces can you drink if your daily calorie target is 2000, and you have already consumed 1400 calories and burned 300 calories through exercise?  

Wrong answer: I calculated that I could drink 32 oz, but I forgot to account for the calories burned through exercise.  

---  
[Example Output]  
Explanation:  
I miscalculated the allowable calorie intake by forgetting to include the calories burned through exercise. This caused me to underestimate the number of calories I could consume and, as a result, incorrectly calculate the number of ounces I could drink.  

Error Keywords:  
- Miscalculation  
- Ignoring exercise calories  
- Incorrect proportional reasoning  

Solution:  
1. Start by calculating the remaining calorie allowance:  
   Daily target = 2000 calories  
   Calories already consumed = 1400 calories  
   Calories burned through exercise = 300 calories  
   Remaining calories = 2000 - 1400 + 300 = 900 calories.  

2. Determine the calories per ounce:  
   150 calories per 8 oz → 150 ÷ 8 = 18.75 calories per ounce.  

3. Calculate how many ounces correspond to 900 calories:  
   900 ÷ 18.75 = 48 ounces.  

4. Final answer: You can drink 48 ounces.  

Instructions:  
1. Calculate the remaining calorie allowance by subtracting calories already consumed and adding calories burned through exercise.  
2. Determine the calorie content per unit (e.g., per ounce) by dividing the total calories by the serving size.  
3. Use the remaining calorie allowance to calculate the allowable quantity (e.g., ounces) by dividing the remaining calories by the calorie content per unit.  
4. Double-check all calculations to ensure accuracy.  

Advice:  
- Always account for all factors affecting calorie intake, including exercise.  
- Break the problem into smaller steps: calculate remaining calories, calories per unit, and allowable quantity.  
- Double-check proportional reasoning and unit conversions to avoid errors.

If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?",180.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ounces of cookies you can eat without exceeding your daily calorie target. Let's break it down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Calculate the remaining calories you can consume
Your daily calorie target is **2300 calories**. You have already consumed **1200 calories** and burned **100 calories** through exercise. The remaining calories you can consume are:

\[
2300 - 1200 + 100 = 1200 \, \text{calories}
\]

So, you have **1200 calories** left to consume.

---

### Step 2: Determine the calories per ounce of cookies
The bag of cookies contains **200 calories per serving**, and the entire bag weighs **150 oz** with **5 servings**. First, calculate the weight of one serving:

\[
\text{Weight of one serving} = \frac{150 \, \text{oz}}{5} = 30 \, \text{oz}
\]

Next, calculate the calories per ounce of cookies:

\[
\text{Calories per ounce} = \frac{200 \, \text{calories}}{30 \, \text{oz}} = \frac{20}{3} \, \text{calories per ounce} \approx 6.67 \, \text{calories per ounce}
\]

---

### Step 3: Determine how many ounces of cookies you can eat
You have **1200 calories** left to consume. To find out how many ounces of cookies you can eat, divide the remaining calories by the calories per ounce:

\[
\text{Ounces of cookies} = \frac{1200 \, \text{calories}}{6.67 \, \text{calories per ounce}} \approx 179.9 \, \text{oz}
\]

---

### Step 4: Check if this exceeds the total bag weight
The total bag weight is **150 oz**, so you cannot eat more than that. Since **179.9 oz** exceeds the bag weight, you can eat the entire bag of cookies (150 oz) without exceeding your calorie target.

---

### Final Answer:
You can eat **150 oz** of cookies.",150.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Your daily calorie target is 2300 calories.  
You have already consumed 1200 calories.  
You exercised and burned 100 calories, so the net calories consumed so far is:  
1200 - 100 = 1100 calories.  

This means you have:  
2300 - 1100 = 1200 calories remaining for the day.  

The bag of cookies has 200 calories per serving, and the entire bag (150 oz) contains 5 servings.  
So, the calories per ounce of cookies is:  
200 calories per serving ÷ (150 oz ÷ 5 servings) = 200 ÷ 30 = 6.67 calories per ounce.  

Now, to find how many ounces you can eat with 1200 calories remaining:  
1200 ÷ 6.67 ≈ 179.9 ounces.  

So, you can eat approximately **179.9 ounces** of cookies.

Now, look at this question:
Question: According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has 200 calories per serving. If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?
Your initial answer was: Let's think step by step.

Your daily calorie target is 2300 calories.  
You have already consumed 1200 calories.  
You exercised and burned 100 calories, so the net calories consumed so far is:  
1200 - 100 = 1100 calories.  

This means you have:  
2300 - 1100 = 1200 calories remaining for the day.  

The bag of cookies has 200 calories per serving, and the entire bag (150 oz) contains 5 servings.  
So, the calories per ounce of cookies is:  
200 calories per serving ÷ (150 oz ÷ 5 servings) = 200 ÷ 30 = 6.67 calories per ounce.  

Now, to find how many ounces you can eat with 1200 calories remaining:  
1200 ÷ 6.67 ≈ 179.9 ounces.

If the city is 18 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/3 of the city?",82.0,"We are tasked with finding how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the city. Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the total time it takes for the fog to cover the entire city.
The city is 18 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles in 41 minutes. To find the total time to cover the entire city, we calculate how many 3-mile segments are in 18 miles:

\[
\text{Number of 3-mile segments} = \frac{18}{3} = 6
\]

Since it takes 41 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, the total time to cover the entire city is:

\[
\text{Total time} = 6 \times 41 = 246 \, \text{minutes}
\]

---

### Step 2: Determine the distance corresponding to \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the city.
The city is 18 miles across, so \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the city is:

\[
\text{Distance for } \frac{1}{3} \text{ of the city} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \, \text{miles}
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the time to cover 6 miles.
The fog bank covers 3 miles in 41 minutes. To cover 6 miles, which is two 3-mile segments, the time required is:

\[
\text{Time to cover 6 miles} = 2 \times 41 = 82 \, \text{minutes}

On Monday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. On Tuesday, he finished homework early and watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. On Wednesday, he got to stay up late, so he watched two 5-hour episodes. On Thursday, he watched four episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 24 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?",5.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Noah spent watching TV on each day and determine how many 15-minute episodes he watched on Monday.

---

### Step 1: Total TV time on Saturday and Sunday
Noah watched **4-hour episodes** on both Saturday and Sunday. Since there are 2 days:
\[
4 \, \text{hours/day} \times 2 \, \text{days} = 8 \, \text{hours}.
\]

---

### Step 2: TV time on Tuesday
On Tuesday, Noah watched:
- A **3-hour episode**: \(3 \, \text{hours}\),
- A **45-minute show**: \(45 \, \text{minutes} = \frac{45}{60} = 0.75 \, \text{hours}\).

Total TV time on Tuesday:
\[
3 \, \text{hours} + 0.75 \, \text{hours} = 3.75 \, \text{hours}.
\]

---

### Step 3: TV time on Wednesday
On Wednesday, Noah watched **two 5-hour episodes**:
\[
5 \, \text{hours/episode} \times 2 \, \text{episodes} = 10 \, \text{hours}.
\]

---

### Step 4: TV time on Thursday
On Thursday, Noah watched **four 15-minute episodes**. Each 15-minute episode is \( \frac{15}{60} = 0.25 \, \text{hours} \). So:
\[
0.25 \, \text{hours/episode} \times 4 \, \text{episodes} = 1 \, \text{hour}.
\]

---

### Step 5: Total TV time for the week (excluding Monday)
Now, we add up the TV time for all the days except Monday:
\[
8 \, \text{hours (Sat & Sun)} + 3.75 \, \text{hours (Tue)} + 10 \, \text{hours (Wed)} + 1 \, \text{hour (Thu)} = 22.75 \, \text{hours}.
\]

---

### Step 6: Total TV time on Monday
Noah watched a total of **24 hours** of TV during the week. Subtracting the time spent on other days:
\[
24 \, \text{hours} - 22.75 \, \text{hours} = 1.25 \, \text{hours}.
\]

So, Noah spent **1.25 hours** watching TV on Monday.

---

### Step 7: Number of 15-minute episodes on Monday
Each 15-minute episode is \( \frac{15}{60} = 0.25 \, \text{hours} \). To find the number of episodes Noah watched on Monday:
\[
\frac{1.25 \, \text{hours}}{0.25 \, \text{hours/episode}} = 5 \, \text{episodes}.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Noah watched **5 episodes** of the 15-minute show on Monday.",15.0,0,"We are tasked with finding how many 15-minute episodes Noah watched on Monday, given that he watched a total of 24 hours of TV throughout the week. Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Convert all times to hours for consistency.
- A 15-minute episode is \( \frac{15}{60} = 0.25 \) hours.

### Step 2: Calculate the total hours of TV Noah watched on each day.
- **Saturday and Sunday:** He watched 4-hour episodes each night. So, \( 4 + 4 = 8 \) hours.
- **Tuesday:** He watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. \( 3 + \frac{45}{60} = 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 \) hours.
- **Wednesday:** He watched two 5-hour episodes. \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) hours.
- **Thursday:** He watched four 15-minute episodes. Each episode is 0.25 hours, so \( 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \) hour.

### Step 3: Add up the hours for all days except Monday.
- Total hours for Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday:
  \[
  8 + 3.75 + 10 + 1 = 22.75 \, \text{hours}.
  \]

### Step 4: Subtract the total hours from 24 to find the hours watched on Monday.
- Total hours watched on Monday:
  \[
  24 - 22.75 = 1.25 \, \text{hours}.
  \]

If she used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.",504.0,"We are tasked with finding the number of teaspoons of sugar Fatima used, given the total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk is 760. Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the ratios
1. **Sugar to water ratio**: \( 63:14 \)
   - For every 63 teaspoons of sugar, there are 14 cups of water.

2. **Milk to water ratio**: \( 9:7 \)
   - For every 9 tablespoons of milk, there are 7 cups of water.

---

### Step 2: Represent the quantities in terms of a common variable
Let the common multiplier for the sugar-to-water ratio be \( x \). Then:
- Sugar = \( 63x \) teaspoons
- Water = \( 14x \) cups

Let the common multiplier for the milk-to-water ratio be \( y \). Then:
- Milk = \( 9y \) tablespoons
- Water = \( 7y \) cups

---

### Step 3: Relate the two ratios using the water quantity
The water quantity must be the same in both ratios. Therefore:
\[
14x = 7y
\]
Solve for \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
y = 2x
\]

---

### Step 4: Express all quantities in terms of \( x \)
Substitute \( y = 2x \) into the expressions for sugar, water, and milk:
- Sugar = \( 63x \) teaspoons
- Water = \( 14x \) cups
- Milk = \( 9y = 9(2x) = 18x \) tablespoons

---

### Step 5: Write the total quantity equation
The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk is 760. Therefore:
\[
\text{Sugar} + \text{Water} + \text{Milk} = 760
\]
Substitute the expressions for sugar, water, and milk:
\[
63x + 14x + 18x = 760
\]
Simplify:
\[
95x = 760
\]

---

### Step 6: Solve for \( x \)
\[
x = \frac{760}{95} = 8
\]

---

### Step 7: Calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar
The number of teaspoons of sugar is:
\[
63x = 63(8) = 504
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Fatima used **504 teaspoons of sugar**.",504.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Fatima uses teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk in the following ratios:
- The ratio of sugar to water is 63:14.
- The ratio of milk to water is 9:7.

### Step 1: Combine the ratios into a single ratio.
To combine the ratios, we need to express all three quantities (sugar, water, and milk) in terms of a common base. The ratio of sugar:water is 63:14, and the ratio of milk:water is 9:7. The common term here is ""water.""

- For sugar:water = 63:14, divide both terms by 7 to simplify:
  \[
  \text{sugar:water} = 9:2.
  \]

- For milk:water = 9:7, divide both terms by 7 to simplify:
  \[
  \text{milk:water} = 9:7.
  \]

Now, we need to express sugar:water:milk in a single ratio. The least common multiple (LCM) of the water terms (2 and 7) is 14. Adjust the ratios so that the water term is 14:
- For sugar:water = 9:2, multiply both terms by 7:
  \[
  \text{sugar:water} = 63:14.
  \]
- For milk:water = 9:7, multiply both terms by 2:
  \[
  \text{milk:water} = 18:14.
  \]

Thus, the combined ratio of sugar:water:milk is:
\[
\text{sugar:water:milk} = 63:14:18.
\]

### Step 2: Find the total parts in the ratio.
Add up the parts in the ratio:
\[
\text{Total parts} = 63 + 14 + 18 = 95.
\]

### Step 3: Determine the value of one part.
Fatima used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk. Each ""part"" in the ratio corresponds to an equal share of this total. To find the value of one part:
\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{760}{95} = 8.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar.
The ratio specifies that sugar corresponds to 63 parts. Since each part is worth 8:
\[
\text{Teaspoons of sugar} = 63 \times 8 = 504.
\]

### Final Answer:
The number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Fatima used is **504**.",504.0,1,1,,,,0,1,504.0,,,

On average, how many LinkedIn friends do Fatima, Noah, and Jasmine have?",54.0,"We are tasked with finding the average number of LinkedIn friends for Fatima, Noah, and Jasmine. Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the variables
- Let \( N \) represent the number of LinkedIn friends Noah has.
- Fatima has 6 times as many friends as Noah, so Fatima has \( 6N \) friends.
- Jasmine has 2 times as many friends as Noah, so Jasmine has \( 2N \) friends.

We are told that Fatima has 108 friends:
\[
6N = 108

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row?,43.75,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is than the other, expressed as a percentage.

---

### Step 1: Probability of rolling a number greater than 10
A 20-sided die has numbers from 1 to 20. The numbers greater than 10 are:  
\[ 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 \]  
There are 10 numbers greater than 10 out of 20 possible outcomes. Thus, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is:  
\[
P(\text{greater than 10}) = \frac{10}{20} = 0.5
\]

---

### Step 2: Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row
On a 20-sided die, half of the numbers are odd (1, 3, 5, ..., 19). Thus, the probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is:  
\[
P(\text{odd}) = \frac{10}{20} = 0.5
\]

To roll four odd numbers in a row, the outcomes of the four rolls are independent, so we multiply the probabilities:  
\[
P(\text{four odd numbers in a row}) = P(\text{odd}) \times P(\text{odd}) \times P(\text{odd}) \times P(\text{odd}) = (0.5)^4 = 0.0625
\]

---

### Step 3: How much more likely is rolling a number greater than 10?
The probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is \( 0.5 \), and the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row is \( 0.0625 \). To find how much more likely the first event is, we calculate the ratio of the probabilities:  
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{P(\text{greater than 10})}{P(\text{four odd numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.0625} = 8
\]

This means rolling a number greater than 10 is 8 times more likely than rolling four odd numbers in a row.

To express this as a percentage, we subtract 1 (to exclude the baseline likelihood of the second event) and multiply by 100:  
\[
\text{Percentage increase} = (8 - 1) \times 100 = 7 \times 100 = 700\%
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Rolling a number greater than 10 is **700% more likely** than rolling four odd numbers in a row.",700.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 on a 20-sided die.
A 20-sided die has numbers from 1 to 20. The numbers greater than 10 are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. That is a total of 10 numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is:
\[
\frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is \( \frac{1}{2} \), or 50%.

---

### Step 2: Determine the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row.
On a 20-sided die, half of the numbers are odd (1, 3, 5, ..., 19). That is 10 odd numbers out of 20 total numbers.

The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is:
\[
\frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

To roll four odd numbers in a row, the probabilities for each roll multiply together:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16}.
\]

So, the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row is \( \frac{1}{16} \), or 6.25%.

---

### Step 3: Find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll four odd numbers in a row.
The probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is 50%, and the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row is 6.25%.

To find how much more likely it is, we calculate the ratio of the two probabilities:
\[
\frac{\text{Probability of rolling a number greater than 10}}{\text{Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row}} = \frac{50\%}{6.25\%} = \frac{50}{6.25} = 8.
\]

This means rolling a number greater than 10 is 8 times more likely than rolling four odd numbers in a row.

To express this as a percentage difference, we subtract the smaller probability from the larger probability:
\[
50\% - 6.25\% = 43.75\%.
\]

---

Rolling a number greater than 10 is 8 times more likely than rolling four odd numbers in a row. The percentage difference is 43.75%.",43.75,1,1,,,,0,1,43.75,,,

He can write a page every 14 minutes. On average, how many hours does Yuki spend writing in a day?",4.0,"Let's break this problem into smaller steps to calculate how many hours Yuki spends writing in a day.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many pen pals Yuki still has.
Yuki originally had 8 pen pals, but he stopped being pen pals with 4 of them. So, the number of pen pals he still has is:

\[
8 - 4 = 4 \text{ pen pals.}
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of letters Yuki receives and sends in a week.
Each pen pal sends 3 letters per week, and Yuki responds to each letter. Since he has 4 pen pals, the total number of letters he receives and sends in a week is:

\[
4 \times 3 \times 2 = 24 \text{ letters per week.}
\]

---

### Step 3: Determine the total number of pages Yuki writes in a week.
Each letter is 10 pages long, and Yuki writes one letter for every letter he receives. Therefore, the total number of pages Yuki writes in a week is:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240 \text{ pages per week.}
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate how much time Yuki spends writing in a week.
Yuki can write 1 page in 14 minutes. So, the total time he spends writing 240 pages in a week is:

\]

---

### Final Answer:
Yuki spends **8 hours per day** writing.",8.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Yuki was a pen pal with 8 people but stopped being pen pals with 4 of them.  
   So, the number of pen pals he still has is:  
   8 - 4 = 4 pen pals.

2. Each pen pal sends 3 letters a week, and Yuki responds to each letter.  
   So, the total number of letters Yuki writes in a week is:  
   4 pen pals × 3 letters per week = 12 letters per week.

3. Each letter is 10 pages long.  
   So, the total number of pages Yuki writes in a week is:  
   12 letters × 10 pages per letter = 120 pages per week.

4. Yuki can write 1 page in 14 minutes.  
   So, the total time Yuki spends writing 120 pages is:  
   120 pages × 14 minutes per page = 1680 minutes.

Mateo has to pay **35% income tax** on his earnings. To find the tax amount, calculate:

\[
₣2620 \times 0.35 = ₣917.
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate Mateo's after-tax earnings
To find Mateo's after-tax earnings, subtract the tax amount from his total earnings:

\[
₣2620 - ₣917 = ₣1703.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Mateo made **₣1703** after tax in September.",1703.0,1,"Mateo works a 6-hour shift each day, 3 days a week. He earns ₣25 per hour and gets a ₣205 bonus each week if the company performs well. Mateo also has to pay 35% as income tax. We need to calculate how much money Mateo made after tax in September if the company performed very well for the whole month.

### Step 1: Calculate Mateo's weekly earnings from his hourly wage.
Mateo works 6 hours per day for 3 days a week.  
The total hours he works in a week is:  
6 hours/day × 3 days = 18 hours.  

He earns ₣25 per hour, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:  
18 hours × ₣25/hour = ₣450.  

### Step 2: Add the weekly bonus.
Since the company performed very well, Mateo gets a ₣205 bonus each week.  
His total weekly earnings (including the bonus) are:  
₣450 + ₣205 = ₣655.  

### Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks in September.
September has 30 days. Since Mateo works 3 days a week, there are 4 full weeks in September.  

### Step 4: Calculate Mateo's total earnings for September.
Mateo earns ₣655 per week. For 4 weeks, his total earnings are:  
₣655 × 4 = ₣2,620.  

### Step 5: Calculate Mateo's income after tax.
Mateo has to pay 35% as income tax. The tax amount is:  
₣2,620 × 35% = ₣2,620 × 0.35 = ₣917.  

His after-tax income is:  
₣2,620 - ₣917 = ₣1,703.  

### Final Answer:
The amount of money Mateo made after tax in September is **₣1,703**.",1703.0,1,1,,,,0,1,1703.0,,,

After 45 minutes, two-thirds of the total number of people left. How many nurses have stayed at the gathering, if 22 lawyers remained?",2.0,"We are tasked with finding how many nurses stayed at the gathering after two-thirds of the people left, given that 22 lawyers remained. Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the number of nurses at the beginning
We are told there were 72 people at the beginning, of which 23 were lawyers. The rest were nurses. 

\[
\text{Number of nurses} = \text{Total people} - \text{Number of lawyers}
\]
\[
\text{Number of nurses} = 72 - 23 = 49
\]

So, there were **49 nurses** at the beginning.

---

### Step 2: Determine how many people left
After 45 minutes, two-thirds of the total number of people left. The total number of people at the beginning was 72. 

\[
\text{Number of people who left} = \frac{2}{3} \times 72 = 48
\]

Thus, **48 people left**, and the remaining number of people is:

\[
\text{Remaining people} = 72 - 48 = 24
\]

So, **24 people stayed** at the gathering.

---

### Step 3: Determine how many nurses stayed
We are told that **22 lawyers remained**. Since the total number of people who stayed is 24, the number of nurses who stayed can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Number of nurses who stayed} = \text{Remaining people} - \text{Remaining lawyers}
\]
\[
\text{Number of nurses who stayed} = 24 - 22 = 2

In the third year, the stock price increases by 25%. By the end of the third year, how much profit has Ananya made?",435.0,"To calculate the profit Ananya made by the end of the third year, we will determine the stock price at each stage and compare the final value of her shares to the initial cost. Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Initial cost of the shares
Ananya buys 12 shares at ¥80 each. The total cost is:
\[
\text{Initial cost} = 12 \times 80 = ¥960
\]

---

### Step 2: Stock price after the first year
The stock price increases by 55% in the first year. To calculate the new price:
\[
\text{New price} = 80 + (55\% \times 80) = 80 + 0.55 \times 80 = 80 + 44 = ¥124
\]

So, after the first year, the stock price is ¥124.

---

### Step 3: Stock price after the second year
The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. To calculate the new price:
\[
\text{New price} = 124 - (25\% \times 124) = 124 - 0.25 \times 124 = 124 - 31 = ¥93
\]

So, after the second year, the stock price is ¥93.

---

### Step 4: Stock price after the third year
The stock price increases by 25% in the third year. To calculate the new price:
\[
\text{New price} = 93 + (25\% \times 93) = 93 + 0.25 \times 93 = 93 + 23.25 = ¥116.25
\]

So, after the third year, the stock price is ¥116.25.

---

### Step 5: Total value of the shares at the end of the third year
Ananya owns 12 shares. The total value of her shares at the end of the third year is:
\[
\text{Total value} = 12 \times 116.25 = ¥1395

### Final Answer:
Ananya made a profit of **¥435** by the end of the third year.",435.0,1,"Ananya buys 12 shares of a stock for ¥80 each.  
The stock price changes over three years, and we need to calculate her profit by the end of the third year.  

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the shares.
Each share costs ¥80, and Ananya buys 12 shares.  
So, the total cost is:  
\[
12 \times 80 = 960
\]  
The total cost of the shares is **¥960**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the stock price after the first year.
The stock price increases by 55% in the first year.  
The new price of each share is:  
\[
80 + (80 \times 0.55) = 80 + 44 = 124
\]  
After the first year, the stock price is **¥124 per share**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the stock price after the second year.
The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year.  
The new price of each share is:  
\[
124 - (124 \times 0.25) = 124 - 31 = 93
\]  
After the second year, the stock price is **¥93 per share**.

---

### Step 4: Calculate the stock price after the third year.
The stock price increases by 25% in the third year.  
The new price of each share is:  
\[
93 + (93 \times 0.25) = 93 + 23.25 = 116.25

### Step 5: Calculate the total value of the shares at the end of the third year.
Ananya owns 12 shares, and each share is worth ¥116.25.  
The total value of the shares is:  
\[
12 \times 116.25 = 1395
\]  
The total value of the shares at the end of the third year is **¥1395**.

p1,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Emma's dad said that she had €180 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends each get to play one round of laser tag, have €4 in pinball tokens, and get to ride the roller coaster three times. A round of laser tag is €6. The roller coaster costs €10 per ride. For the transportation of the birthday party guests, Emma needs to rent a bus for the day, which costs €60. How many friends can she invite?",2.0,"To determine how many friends Emma can invite, we need to calculate the total cost per person for the activities and transportation, and then see how many people (including Emma) can fit within the €180 budget.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the cost per person for the activities
Each person will:
- Play one round of laser tag, which costs **€6**.
- Receive **€4** in pinball tokens.
- Ride the roller coaster three times, with each ride costing **€10**.

The total cost per person for the activities is:
\[
6 + 4 + (3 \times 10) = 6 + 4 + 30 = 40 \, \text{euros per person}.
\]

---

### Step 2: Account for the bus rental cost
The bus rental costs **€60** for the day. This cost is shared among Emma and her friends.

---

### Step 3: Write the total cost equation
Let \( n \) represent the number of friends Emma invites. Including Emma herself, there will be \( n + 1 \) people at the party.

The total cost of the party is:
\[
\text{Total cost} = (\text{Cost per person} \times \text{Number of people}) + \text{Bus rental cost}.
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
\text{Total cost} = (40 \times (n + 1)) + 60.
\]

This total cost must not exceed Emma's budget of €180:
\[
(40 \times (n + 1)) + 60 \leq 180.
\]

---

### Step 4: Solve for \( n \)
Simplify the inequality:
\[
40(n + 1) + 60 \leq 180.
\]
\[
40n + 40 + 60 \leq 180.
\]
\[
40n + 100 \leq 180.
\]
\[
40n \leq 80.
\]
\[
n \leq 2.
\]

---

### Step 5: Interpret the result
The maximum number of friends Emma can invite is **2**. Including Emma herself, there will be \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) people at the party.

---

### Step 6: Verify the calculation
If Emma invites 2 friends, there will be 3 people total. The total cost is:
\[
\text{Total cost} = (40 \times 3) + 60 = 120 + 60 = 180 \, \text{euros}.
\]
This matches the budget, so the solution is correct.

---

### Final Answer:
Emma can invite **2 friends**.",2.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Emma has a total budget of €180 for her birthday party.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost per person for activities.
- A round of laser tag costs €6.
- Pinball tokens cost €4.
- Riding the roller coaster three times costs 3 * €10 = €30.
- So, the total cost per person for activities is €6 + €4 + €30 = €40.

### Step 2: Subtract the cost of the bus rental.
- The bus rental costs €60.
- After paying for the bus, the remaining budget is €180 - €60 = €120.

### Step 3: Determine how many friends Emma can invite.
- Each person (including Emma) costs €40 for activities.
- To find how many people can be covered by the remaining €120, divide €120 by €40:
  €120 / €40 = 3.

### Step 4: Account for Emma herself.
- Emma is one of the people, so she can invite 3 - 1 = 2 friends.

How many pineapples and kiwis does Theo have in the house combined?",349.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Initial number of kiwis and pineapples
Theo has **25 kiwis** in his house. Since there are **8 times as many pineapples as kiwis**, the number of pineapples is:

8 \times 25 = 200 \text{ pineapples.}
\]

So initially, Theo has:
- **25 kiwis**
- **200 pineapples**

---

### Step 2: Theo buys more kiwis and pineapples
Theo buys **63 more kiwis** at the store. The new total number of kiwis is:

\[
25 + 63 = 88 \text{ kiwis.}
\]

Theo also buys **19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis**. Since there are now 88 kiwis, the number of pineapples he buys is:

\[
88 - 19 = 69 \text{ pineapples.}
\]

Adding these to the initial totals, Theo now has:
- **88 kiwis**
- **200 + 69 = 269 pineapples**

### Step 3: Theo buys more kiwis and pineapples again
Theo later buys **13 pineapples**. Adding this to the current total, the new number of pineapples is:

\[
269 + 13 = 282 \text{ pineapples.}

2 \times 88 = 176.
\]

Subtracting 22, the number of kiwis he buys is:

\[
176 - 22 = 154 \text{ kiwis.}
\]

Adding this to the current total, the new number of kiwis is:

\[
88 + 154 = 242 \text{ kiwis.}
\]

### Step 4: Total number of kiwis and pineapples
Now, Theo has:
- **242 kiwis**
- **282 pineapples**

The total number of fruits is:

\[
242 + 282 = 524.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Theo has **524 fruits** in total.",524.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Initial number of kiwis and pineapples:**
   - Theo has 25 kiwis in his house.
   - There are eight times as many pineapples as kiwis initially. So, the number of pineapples is \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \).

2. **Theo buys more kiwis:**
   - Theo buys 63 more kiwis at the store. So, the total number of kiwis now is:
     \[
     25 + 63 = 88
     \]

3. **Theo buys fewer pineapples than kiwis:**
   - Theo buys 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis. Since there are now 88 kiwis, the number of pineapples he buys is:
     \[
     88 - 19 = 69
     \]

   - Adding these new pineapples to the initial number of pineapples (200), the total number of pineapples now is:
     \[
     200 + 69 = 269
     \]

4. **Theo buys more pineapples and fewer kiwis:**
   - Theo later buys 13 more pineapples. Adding this to the current total of 269 pineapples, the new total number of pineapples is:
     \[
     269 + 13 = 282
     \]

   - Theo also buys 22 fewer than two times as many kiwis. The current number of kiwis is 88, so two times as many kiwis is:
     \[
     2 \times 88 = 176
     \]
     Subtracting 22, the number of kiwis he buys is:
     \[
     176 - 22 = 154
     \]

   - Adding these new kiwis to the current total of 88 kiwis, the new total number of kiwis is:
     \[
     88 + 154 = 242
     \]

5. **Total number of pineapples and kiwis:**
   - Theo now has 282 pineapples and 242 kiwis. The total number of fruits is:
     \[
     282 + 242 = 524
     \]

Question: At Theo's house, there are eight times as many pineapples as kiwis. He has a total of 25 kiwis in his house. Theo then bought 63 more kiwis at the store and 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis. He later bought 13 pineapples and 22 fewer than two times as many kiwis. How many pineapples and kiwis does Theo have in the house combined?
Your initial answer was: Let's think step by step.

1. **Initial number of kiwis and pineapples:**
   - Theo has 25 kiwis in his house.
   - There are eight times as many pineapples as kiwis initially. So, the number of pineapples is \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \).

2. **Theo buys more kiwis:**
   - Theo buys 63 more kiwis at the store. So, the total number of kiwis now is:
     \[
     25 + 63 = 88
     \]

3. **Theo buys fewer pineapples than kiwis:**
   - Theo buys 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis. Since there are now 88 kiwis, the number of pineapples he buys is:
     \[
     88 - 19 = 69
     \]

   - Adding these new pineapples to the initial number of pineapples (200), the total number of pineapples now is:
     \[
     200 + 69 = 269
     \]

4. **Theo buys more pineapples and fewer kiwis:**
   - Theo later buys 13 more pineapples. Adding this to the current total of 269 pineapples, the new total number of pineapples is:
     \[
     269 + 13 = 282
     \]

   - Theo also buys 22 fewer than two times as many kiwis. The current number of kiwis is 88, so two times as many kiwis is:
     \[
     2 \times 88 = 176
     \]
     Subtracting 22, the number of kiwis he buys is:
     \[
     176 - 22 = 154
     \]

   - Adding these new kiwis to the current total of 88 kiwis, the new total number of kiwis is:
     \[
     88 + 154 = 242
     \]

5. **Total number of pineapples and kiwis:**
   - Theo now has 282 pineapples and 242 kiwis. The total number of fruits is:
     \[
     282 + 242 = 524
     \]

The answer is 524.

---

### Correct Solution (Step-by-Step):

1. **Initial number of kiwis and pineapples:**
   - Theo has **25 kiwis** in his house.
   - There are **eight times as many pineapples as kiwis initially**. So, the number of pineapples is:
     \[
     8 \times 25 = 200
     \]

2. **Theo buys more kiwis:**
   - Theo buys **63 more kiwis** at the store. The total number of kiwis now is:
     \[
     25 + 63 = 88
     \]

3. **Theo buys fewer pineapples than kiwis:**
   - Theo buys **19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis**. Since there are now **88 kiwis**, the number of pineapples he buys is:
     \[
     88 - 19 = 69
     \]
   - Adding these new pineapples to the initial number of pineapples (**200**), the total number of pineapples now is:
     \[
     200 + 69 = 269
     \]

4. **Theo buys more pineapples and fewer kiwis:**
   - Theo later buys **13 more pineapples**. Adding this to the current total of **269 pineapples**, the new total number of pineapples is:
     \[
     269 + 13 = 282
     \]
   - Theo also buys **22 fewer than two times as many kiwis**. The current number of kiwis is **88**, so two times as many kiwis is:
     \[
     2 \times 88 = 176
     \]
     Subtracting **22**, the number of kiwis he buys is:
     \[
     176 - 22 = 154
     \]
   - Adding these new kiwis to the current total of **88 kiwis**, the new total number of kiwis is:
     \[
     88 + 154 = 242
     \]

5. **Total number of pineapples and kiwis:**
   - Theo now has **282 pineapples** and **242 kiwis**. The total number of fruits is:
     \[
     282 + 242 = 524
     \]

**Final Answer: 524**

How many pineapples and kiwis does Theo have in the house combined?",349.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Initial number of kiwis and pineapples
Theo has **25 kiwis** in his house. Since there are **8 times as many pineapples as kiwis**, the number of pineapples is:

\[
8 \times 25 = 200 \text{ pineapples.}
\]

So initially, Theo has:
- **25 kiwis**
- **200 pineapples**

---

### Step 2: Theo buys more kiwis and pineapples
Theo buys **63 more kiwis** at the store. The new total number of kiwis is:

\[
25 + 63 = 88 \text{ kiwis.}
\]

Theo also buys **19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis**. Since there are now 88 kiwis, the number of pineapples he buys is:

\[
88 - 19 = 69 \text{ pineapples.}
\]

Adding these to the initial totals, Theo now has:
- **88 kiwis**
- **200 + 69 = 269 pineapples**

---

### Step 3: Theo buys more kiwis and pineapples again
Theo later buys **13 pineapples**. Adding this to the current total, the new number of pineapples is:

\[
269 + 13 = 282 \text{ pineapples.}
\]

He also buys **22 fewer than two times as many kiwis**. The current number of kiwis is 88, so two times as many kiwis is:

\[
2 \times 88 = 176.
\]

Subtracting 22, the number of kiwis he buys is:

\[
176 - 22 = 154 \text{ kiwis.}
\]

Adding this to the current total, the new number of kiwis is:

\[
88 + 154 = 242 \text{ kiwis.}
\]

---

### Step 4: Total number of kiwis and pineapples
Now, Theo has:
- **242 kiwis**
- **282 pineapples**

The total number of fruits is:

\[
242 + 282 = 524.

1. **Initial number of kiwis and pineapples:**
   - Theo has 25 kiwis in his house.
   - There are eight times as many pineapples as kiwis initially. So, the number of pineapples is \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \).

2. **Theo buys more kiwis:**
   - Theo buys 63 more kiwis at the store. So, the total number of kiwis now is:
     \[
     25 + 63 = 88
     \]

3. **Theo buys fewer pineapples than kiwis:**
   - Theo buys 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis. Since there are now 88 kiwis, the number of pineapples he buys is:
     \[
     88 - 19 = 69

   - Adding these new pineapples to the initial number of pineapples (200), the total number of pineapples now is:
     \[
     200 + 69 = 269
     \]

4. **Theo buys more pineapples and fewer kiwis:**
   - Theo later buys 13 more pineapples. Adding this to the current total of 269 pineapples, the new total number of pineapples is:
     \[
     269 + 13 = 282

     2 \times 88 = 176
     \]
     Subtracting 22, the number of kiwis he buys is:
     \[
     176 - 22 = 154
     \]

   - Adding these new kiwis to the current total of 88 kiwis, the new total number of kiwis is:
     \[
     88 + 154 = 242

Now, look at this question:
Question: At Theo's house, there are eight times as many pineapples as kiwis. He has a total of 25 kiwis in his house. Theo then bought 63 more kiwis at the store and 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis. He later bought 13 pineapples and 22 fewer than two times as many kiwis. How many pineapples and kiwis does Theo have in the house combined?
Your initial answer was: Let's think step by step.

1. **Initial number of kiwis and pineapples:**
   - Theo has 25 kiwis in his house.
   - There are eight times as many pineapples as kiwis initially. So, the number of pineapples is \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \).

2. **Theo buys more kiwis:**
   - Theo buys 63 more kiwis at the store. So, the total number of kiwis now is:
     \[
     25 + 63 = 88
     \]

3. **Theo buys fewer pineapples than kiwis:**
   - Theo buys 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis. Since there are now 88 kiwis, the number of pineapples he buys is:
     \[
     88 - 19 = 69
     \]

   - Adding these new pineapples to the initial number of pineapples (200), the total number of pineapples now is:
     \[
     200 + 69 = 269
     \]

4. **Theo buys more pineapples and fewer kiwis:**
   - Theo later buys 13 more pineapples. Adding this to the current total of 269 pineapples, the new total number of pineapples is:
     \[
     269 + 13 = 282
     \]

   - Theo also buys 22 fewer than two times as many kiwis. The current number of kiwis is 88, so two times as many kiwis is:
     \[
     2 \times 88 = 176
     \]
     Subtracting 22, the number of kiwis he buys is:
     \[
     176 - 22 = 154
     \]

   - Adding these new kiwis to the current total of 88 kiwis, the new total number of kiwis is:
     \[
     88 + 154 = 242
     \]

5. **Total number of pineapples and kiwis:**
   - Theo now has 282 pineapples and 242 kiwis. The total number of fruits is:
     \[
     282 + 242 = 524
     \]

The answer is 524.
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","### Reflection on the Incorrect Answer:

1. **Explanation of the Error:**
   - My initial answer was incorrect because I miscalculated the total number of kiwis and pineapples at one or more steps. Specifically, I may have made an arithmetic error when adding or subtracting quantities, or I may have misunderstood the phrasing of the problem (e.g., ""22 fewer than two times as many kiwis"").
   - The gap in my knowledge was not in understanding the problem's structure but in executing the calculations accurately and interpreting the problem's wording correctly.

2. **Error Keywords:**
   - Calculation error
   - Arithmetic error
   - Misinterpretation of problem wording

---

### Correct Solution (Step-by-Step):

1. **Initial number of kiwis and pineapples:**
   - Theo has **25 kiwis** in his house.
   - There are **eight times as many pineapples as kiwis initially**. So, the number of pineapples is:
     \[
     8 \times 25 = 200
     \]

2. **Theo buys more kiwis:**
   - Theo buys **63 more kiwis** at the store. The total number of kiwis now is:
     \[
     25 + 63 = 88
     \]

3. **Theo buys fewer pineapples than kiwis:**
   - Theo buys **19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis**. Since there are now **88 kiwis**, the number of pineapples he buys is:
     \[
     88 - 19 = 69
     \]
   - Adding these new pineapples to the initial number of pineapples (**200**), the total number of pineapples now is:
     \[
     200 + 69 = 269
     \]

4. **Theo buys more pineapples and fewer kiwis:**
   - Theo later buys **13 more pineapples**. Adding this to the current total of **269 pineapples**, the new total number of pineapples is:
     \[
     269 + 13 = 282
     \]
   - Theo also buys **22 fewer than two times as many kiwis**. The current number of kiwis is **88**, so two times as many kiwis is:
     \[
     2 \times 88 = 176
     \]
     Subtracting **22**, the number of kiwis he buys is:
     \[
     176 - 22 = 154
     \]
   - Adding these new kiwis to the current total of **88 kiwis**, the new total number of kiwis is:
     \[
     88 + 154 = 242
     \]

5. **Total number of pineapples and kiwis:**
   - Theo now has **282 pineapples** and **242 kiwis**. The total number of fruits is:
     \[
     282 + 242 = 524
     \]

**Final Answer: 524**

Question: At a farmer's market, there are five times as many apples as oranges. The vendor has 12 oranges. Later, the vendor sells 8 oranges and 15 fewer apples than the number of oranges sold. Afterward, the vendor receives a shipment of 20 oranges and 10 more apples than twice the number of oranges in the shipment. How many apples and oranges does the vendor have now?  
Wrong answer: I calculated that the vendor has 50 apples and 24 oranges. I made a mistake in interpreting the relationship between the apples and oranges in the shipment.  

---  
[Example Output]  
Explanation:  
I misinterpreted the relationship between the apples and oranges in the shipment. I incorrectly calculated the number of apples in the shipment as being equal to twice the number of oranges, rather than 10 more than twice the number of oranges. This led to an incorrect total for the apples.

2. Account for the oranges and apples sold.  
   - The vendor sells 8 oranges: \( 12 - 8 = 4 \) oranges left.  
   - The vendor sells 15 fewer apples than the number of oranges sold: \( 8 - 15 = -7 \).  
     (This is incorrect because the number of apples sold cannot be negative. Correct interpretation: \( 60 - 15 = 45 \) apples left.)  

3. Add the shipment of oranges and apples.  
   - The vendor receives 20 oranges: \( 4 + 20 = 24 \) oranges.  
   - The vendor receives 10 more apples than twice the number of oranges in the shipment: \( 2 \times 20 + 10 = 50 \).  
   - Total apples: \( 45 + 50 = 95 \).  

4. Final count: 95 apples, 24 oranges.  

Instructions:  
1. Carefully read the problem and identify all relationships between quantities.  
2. Write down equations or expressions for each relationship.  
3. Double-check the interpretation of proportional relationships and constraints.  
4. Perform arithmetic operations step-by-step, verifying each calculation.

Theo then bought 63 more kiwis at the store and 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis. He later bought 13 pineapples and 22 fewer than two times as many kiwis. How many pineapples and kiwis does Theo have in the house combined?",349.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Initial number of kiwis and pineapples
Theo has **25 kiwis** in his house. Since there are **8 times as many pineapples as kiwis**, the number of pineapples is:

\[
8 \times 25 = 200 \text{ pineapples.}
\]

So initially, Theo has:
- **25 kiwis**
- **200 pineapples**

---

### Step 2: Theo buys more kiwis and pineapples
Theo buys **63 more kiwis** at the store. The new total number of kiwis is:

\[
25 + 63 = 88 \text{ kiwis.}
\]

Theo also buys **19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis**. Since there are now 88 kiwis, the number of pineapples he buys is:

\[
88 - 19 = 69 \text{ pineapples.}
\]

Adding these to the initial totals, Theo now has:
- **88 kiwis**
- **200 + 69 = 269 pineapples**

---

### Step 3: Theo buys more kiwis and pineapples again
Theo later buys **13 pineapples**. Adding this to the current total, the new number of pineapples is:

\[
269 + 13 = 282 \text{ pineapples.}
\]

He also buys **22 fewer than two times as many kiwis**. The current number of kiwis is 88, so two times as many kiwis is:

\[
2 \times 88 = 176.
\]

Subtracting 22, the number of kiwis he buys is:

\[
176 - 22 = 154 \text{ kiwis.}
\]

Adding this to the current total, the new number of kiwis is:

\[
88 + 154 = 242 \text{ kiwis.}
\]

---

### Step 4: Total number of kiwis and pineapples
Now, Theo has:
- **242 kiwis**
- **282 pineapples**

The total number of fruits is:

\[
242 + 282 = 524.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Theo has **524 fruits** in total.",524.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Initial number of kiwis and pineapples:**
   - Theo has 25 kiwis in his house.
   - There are eight times as many pineapples as kiwis initially. So, the number of pineapples is \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \).

2. **Theo buys more kiwis:**
   - Theo buys 63 more kiwis at the store. So, the total number of kiwis now is:
     \[
     25 + 63 = 88
     \]

3. **Theo buys fewer pineapples than kiwis:**
   - Theo buys 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis. Since there are now 88 kiwis, the number of pineapples he buys is:
     \[
     88 - 19 = 69
     \]

   - Adding these new pineapples to the initial number of pineapples (200), the total number of pineapples now is:
     \[
     200 + 69 = 269
     \]

4. **Theo buys more pineapples and fewer kiwis:**
   - Theo later buys 13 more pineapples. Adding this to the current total of 269 pineapples, the new total number of pineapples is:
     \[
     269 + 13 = 282
     \]

   - Theo also buys 22 fewer than two times as many kiwis. The current number of kiwis is 88, so two times as many kiwis is:
     \[
     2 \times 88 = 176

Now, look at this question:
Question: At Theo's house, there are eight times as many pineapples as kiwis. He has a total of 25 kiwis in his house. Theo then bought 63 more kiwis at the store and 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis. He later bought 13 pineapples and 22 fewer than two times as many kiwis. How many pineapples and kiwis does Theo have in the house combined?
Your initial answer was: Let's think step by step.

1. **Initial number of kiwis and pineapples:**
   - Theo has 25 kiwis in his house.
   - There are eight times as many pineapples as kiwis initially. So, the number of pineapples is \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \).

2. **Theo buys more kiwis:**
   - Theo buys 63 more kiwis at the store. So, the total number of kiwis now is:
     \[
     25 + 63 = 88
     \]

3. **Theo buys fewer pineapples than kiwis:**
   - Theo buys 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis. Since there are now 88 kiwis, the number of pineapples he buys is:
     \[
     88 - 19 = 69
     \]

   - Adding these new pineapples to the initial number of pineapples (200), the total number of pineapples now is:
     \[
     200 + 69 = 269
     \]

4. **Theo buys more pineapples and fewer kiwis:**
   - Theo later buys 13 more pineapples. Adding this to the current total of 269 pineapples, the new total number of pineapples is:
     \[
     269 + 13 = 282
     \]

   - Theo also buys 22 fewer than two times as many kiwis. The current number of kiwis is 88, so two times as many kiwis is:
     \[
     2 \times 88 = 176
     \]
     Subtracting 22, the number of kiwis he buys is:
     \[
     176 - 22 = 154
     \]

   - Adding these new kiwis to the current total of 88 kiwis, the new total number of kiwis is:
     \[
     88 + 154 = 242
     \]

5. **Total number of pineapples and kiwis:**
   - Theo now has 282 pineapples and 242 kiwis. The total number of fruits is:
     \[
     282 + 242 = 524
     \]

The answer is 524.

","### Reflection on the Incorrect Answer:

1. **Explanation of the Error:**
   - My initial answer was incorrect because I miscalculated the total number of kiwis and pineapples at one or more steps. Specifically, I may have made an arithmetic error when adding or subtracting quantities, or I may have misunderstood the phrasing of the problem (e.g., ""22 fewer than two times as many kiwis"").
   - The gap in my knowledge was not in understanding the problem's structure but in executing the calculations accurately and interpreting the problem's wording correctly.

2. **Error Keywords:**
   - Calculation error
   - Arithmetic error
   - Misinterpretation of problem wording

---

### Correct Solution (Step-by-Step):

1. **Initial number of kiwis and pineapples:**
   - Theo has **25 kiwis** in his house.
   - There are **eight times as many pineapples as kiwis initially**. So, the number of pineapples is:
     \[
     8 \times 25 = 200
     \]

2. **Theo buys more kiwis:**
   - Theo buys **63 more kiwis** at the store. The total number of kiwis now is:
     \[
     25 + 63 = 88
     \]

3. **Theo buys fewer pineapples than kiwis:**
   - Theo buys **19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis**. Since there are now **88 kiwis**, the number of pineapples he buys is:
     \[
     88 - 19 = 69
     \]
   - Adding these new pineapples to the initial number of pineapples (**200**), the total number of pineapples now is:
     \[
     200 + 69 = 269
     \]

4. **Theo buys more pineapples and fewer kiwis:**
   - Theo later buys **13 more pineapples**. Adding this to the current total of **269 pineapples**, the new total number of pineapples is:
     \[
     269 + 13 = 282
     \]
   - Theo also buys **22 fewer than two times as many kiwis**. The current number of kiwis is **88**, so two times as many kiwis is:
     \[
     2 \times 88 = 176
     \]
     Subtracting **22**, the number of kiwis he buys is:
     \[
     176 - 22 = 154
     \]
   - Adding these new kiwis to the current total of **88 kiwis**, the new total number of kiwis is:
     \[
     88 + 154 = 242
     \]

5. **Total number of pineapples and kiwis:**
   - Theo now has **282 pineapples** and **242 kiwis**. The total number of fruits is:
     \[
     282 + 242 = 524
     \]

**Final Answer: 524**

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Reflection on Incorrect Answers:

#### Explanation of Mistakes:
1. **Initial Answer (524.0):**  
   - The initial answer was incorrect because I likely made a calculation error or misinterpreted the relationships between the quantities of pineapples and kiwis. Specifically, I may have failed to correctly account for the relationships described in the problem, such as ""19 fewer pineapples than kiwis"" or ""22 fewer than two times as many kiwis.""

2. **Reflection 1 and 2 (499.0):**  
   - Both reflections repeated the same incorrect answer, which suggests that I did not fully address the root cause of the error. I may have overlooked a key step in the problem or failed to verify intermediate calculations. Additionally, I may have miscalculated the final totals or misinterpreted the relationships between the quantities.

#### Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of word problem
- Incorrect relationship between variables
- Arithmetic error in intermediate step
- Failure to verify intermediate results

---

### Correct Solution (Step-by-Step):

#### Step 1: Initial quantities of kiwis and pineapples
- Theo has **25 kiwis** in his house.  
- There are **8 times as many pineapples as kiwis**, so the number of pineapples is:  
  \[
  8 \times 25 = 200 \text{ pineapples.}
  \]

#### Step 2: Theo buys more kiwis and pineapples
- Theo buys **63 more kiwis**, so the total number of kiwis becomes:  
  \[
  25 + 63 = 88 \text{ kiwis.}
  \]
- Theo buys **19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis he just bought (63 kiwis)**. The number of pineapples he buys is:  
  \[
  63 - 19 = 44 \text{ pineapples.}
  \]
- Adding these to the initial totals:  
  - Total kiwis: \( 88 \)  
  - Total pineapples: \( 200 + 44 = 244 \)

#### Step 3: Theo buys more kiwis and pineapples
- Theo buys **13 more pineapples**, so the total number of pineapples becomes:  
  \[
  244 + 13 = 257 \text{ pineapples.}
  \]
- Theo buys **22 fewer than two times as many kiwis as he currently has (88 kiwis)**. The number of kiwis he buys is:  
  \[
  2 \times 88 - 22 = 176 - 22 = 154 \text{ kiwis.}
  \]
- Adding these to the current totals:  
  - Total kiwis: \( 88 + 154 = 242 \)  
  - Total pineapples: \( 257 \)

#### Step 4: Final totals
- Total number of kiwis: \( 242 \)  
- Total number of pineapples: \( 257 \)  
- Combined total:  
  \[
  242 + 257 = 499
  \]

At the gift shop, saltwater taffy was on sale for ""Buy 16 kgs at $23 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/2 off."" She scooped up 23 kgs. She also bought a mixed bag of starfish for $11.0 and 17 keychains that were $20.0 each. Ananya then donated $5 at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Ananya have left?",361.0,"Let's calculate step by step how much money Ananya spent and how much she has left.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the cost of the saltwater taffy**
The deal is ""Buy 16 kgs at $23 per kg, get 4 kgs at half price."" Ananya bought **23 kgs** of taffy, so we need to break this into parts:

1. **Cost of the first 16 kgs:**
   \[
   16 \, \text{kgs} \times 23 \, \text{dollars per kg} = 368 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of the next 4 kgs at half price:**
   Half price of $23 per kg is:
   \[
   \frac{23}{2} = 11.5 \, \text{dollars per kg}
   \]
   So, the cost for 4 kgs is:
   \[
   4 \, \text{kgs} \times 11.5 \, \text{dollars per kg} = 46 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of the remaining 3 kgs (full price):**
   \[
   3 \, \text{kgs} \times 23 \, \text{dollars per kg} = 69 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Total cost of the taffy:**
   \[
   368 + 46 + 69 = 483 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the cost of the mixed bag of starfish**
The mixed bag of starfish costs:
\[
11.0 \, \text{dollars}
\]

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the cost of the keychains**
Ananya bought **17 keychains** at $20.0 each:
\[
17 \, \text{keychains} \times 20.0 \, \text{dollars per keychain} = 340 \, \text{dollars}
\]

---

### **Step 4: Calculate the donation to charity**
Ananya donated:
\[
5 \, \text{dollars}
\]

---

### **Step 5: Calculate the total amount spent**
Now, add up all the amounts Ananya spent:
\[
483 \, \text{(taffy)} + 11 \, \text{(starfish)} + 340 \, \text{(keychains)} + 5 \, \text{(donation)} = 839 \, \text{dollars}
\]

---

### **Step 6: Calculate how much money Ananya has left**
Ananya started with $1200. Subtract the total amount spent:
\[
1200 - 839 = 361 \, \text{dollars}
\]

---

### **Final Answer:**
Ananya has **$361** left.",361.0,1,"Ananya starts with $1200. Let's calculate her expenses step by step.

1. **Saltwater taffy cost:**
   - The deal is ""Buy 16 kgs at $23 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/2 off.""
   - For the first 16 kgs, the cost is \( 16 \times 23 = 368 \) dollars.
   - For the 4 kgs at half price, the cost is \( 4 \times (23 / 2) = 4 \times 11.5 = 46 \) dollars.
   - Ananya bought 23 kgs in total, so she also bought 3 additional kgs at full price. The cost for these 3 kgs is \( 3 \times 23 = 69 \) dollars.
   - The total cost for the saltwater taffy is \( 368 + 46 + 69 = 483 \) dollars.

2. **Mixed bag of starfish:**
   - The cost of the mixed bag of starfish is $11.0.

3. **Keychains:**
   - Each keychain costs $20.0, and Ananya bought 17 keychains.
   - The total cost for the keychains is \( 17 \times 20 = 340 \) dollars.

4. **Charity donation:**
   - Ananya donated $5 at a charity stand.

5. **Total expenses:**
   - Adding up all the expenses: \( 483 + 11 + 340 + 5 = 839 \) dollars.

6. **Money left:**
   - Ananya started with $1200. After spending $839, the money left is \( 1200 - 839 = 361 \) dollars.

Oscar slew **one-ninth as many giants as Luis**. Since Luis slew 1080 giants:
\[
\text{Oscar's giants} = \frac{1}{9} \times 1080 = 120
\]

---

### Step 4: Find the total number of giants slain.
The total number of giants slain by all four people is:
\[
\text{Total giants} = \text{Theo's giants} + \text{Jamal's giants} + \text{Luis's giants} + \text{Oscar's giants}
\]
\[
\text{Total giants} = 450 + 270 + 1080 + 120 = 1920
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the average number of giants slain per person.
There are 4 people (Theo, Jamal, Luis, and Oscar). The average number of giants slain is:
\[
\text{Average giants per person} = \frac{\text{Total giants}}{\text{Number of people}}
\]
\[
\text{Average giants per person} = \frac{1920}{4} = 480
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Each person slew **480 giants on average**.",480.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Theo's giants:**
   Theo slew 450 giants.

2. **Jamal's giants:**
   Jamal slew three-fifths as many giants as Theo. To find this, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Jamal's giants} = \frac{3}{5} \times 450 = 270
   \]
   So, Jamal slew 270 giants.

3. **Luis's giants:**
   Luis slew four times as many giants as Jamal. To find this, we calculate:

Andre spent $100 and got 4 bags of crackers, 7 packs of pretzels, and had 3% of his money left in change. How many gum did he buy?",45.0,"We are tasked with determining how many packs of gum Andre bought. Let's break this problem into steps.

---

### Step 1: Define the costs of the items
- Crackers cost **75 cents** each.
- Gum costs **100 cents** each.
- Pretzels cost **$7**, which is equivalent to **700 cents**.

---

### Step 2: Define the total money Andre spent
Andre started with **$100**, which is equivalent to **10,000 cents**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Andre had left
Andre had **3% of his money left** as change. To find this amount:
\[
\text{Change} = 3\% \times 10,000 = 0.03 \times 10,000 = 300 \, \text{cents}.
\]

This means Andre spent:
\[
\text{Money spent} = 10,000 - 300 = 9,700 \, \text{cents}.
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of crackers and pretzels
Andre bought:
- **4 bags of crackers** at 75 cents each:
\[
\text{Cost of crackers} = 4 \times 75 = 300 \, \text{cents}.
\]
- **7 packs of pretzels** at 700 cents each:
\[
\text{Cost of pretzels} = 7 \times 700 = 4,900 \, \text{cents}.
\]

The total cost of crackers and pretzels is:
\[
\text{Total cost of crackers and pretzels} = 300 + 4,900 = 5,200 \, \text{cents}.
\]

---

### Step 5: Determine how much Andre spent on gum
The total amount Andre spent was 9,700 cents. Subtract the cost of crackers and pretzels to find how much he spent on gum:
\[
\text{Cost of gum} = 9,700 - 5,200 = 4,500 \, \text{cents}.
\]

---

### Step 6: Calculate the number of packs of gum
Each pack of gum costs 100 cents. To find the number of packs of gum Andre bought:
\[
\text{Number of packs of gum} = \frac{\text{Cost of gum}}{\text{Cost per pack}} = \frac{4,500}{100} = 45.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Andre bought **45 packs of gum**.",45.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Andre starts with $100. To make calculations easier, let's convert everything to cents. So, $100 is 100 * 100 = 10,000 cents.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of crackers.
Andre bought 4 bags of crackers. Each bag costs 75 cents.
The total cost of crackers is:
4 * 75 = 300 cents.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of pretzels.
Andre bought 7 packs of pretzels. Each pack costs $7, which is 7 * 100 = 700 cents.
The total cost of pretzels is:
7 * 700 = 4,900 cents.

### Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Andre had left as change.
Andre had 3% of his money left in change. Since he started with 10,000 cents, 3% of 10,000 is:
(3 / 100) * 10,000 = 300 cents.
So, Andre had 300 cents left as change.

### Step 4: Calculate how much money Andre spent in total.
The total money Andre spent is:
10,000 (starting amount) - 300 (change) = 9,700 cents.

### Step 5: Calculate how much money Andre spent on gum.
Andre spent 9,700 cents in total. Out of this, he spent 300 cents on crackers and 4,900 cents on pretzels. The remaining money was spent on gum.
The amount spent on gum is:
9,700 - 300 - 4,900 = 4,500 cents.

### Step 6: Calculate how many packs of gum Andre bought.
Each pack of gum costs 100 cents. The number of packs of gum Andre bought is:
4,500 / 100 = 45.

p1,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"The area of Kai's rectangular office is 225 square feet. If the length of his room is 16 feet longer that its width, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?",68.0,"We are tasked with finding the perimeter of Kai's rectangular office. Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the variables
Let the width of the office be \( w \) (in feet).  
Since the length is 16 feet longer than the width, the length is \( w + 16 \) (in feet).

The area of a rectangle is given by:
\[
\text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
\]
We are told the area is 225 square feet, so:
\[
w \times (w + 16) = 225
\]

---

### Step 2: Solve for \( w \)
Expand the equation:
\[
w^2 + 16w = 225
\]

Rearrange into standard quadratic form:
\[
w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0
\]

Now solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[
w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 16 \), and \( c = -225 \). Substituting these values:
\[
w = \frac{-16 \pm \sqrt{16^2 - 4(1)(-225)}}{2(1)}
\]
\[
w = \frac{-16 \pm \sqrt{256 + 900}}{2}
\]
\[
w = \frac{-16 \pm \sqrt{1156}}{2}
\]
\[
w = \frac{-16 \pm 34}{2}
\]

Now calculate the two possible solutions:
\[
w = \frac{-16 + 34}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
\]
\[
w = \frac{-16 - 34}{2} = \frac{-50}{2} = -25
\]

Since width cannot be negative, we have:
\[
w = 9
\]

---

### Step 3: Find the length
The length is:
\[
w + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the perimeter
The perimeter of a rectangle is given by:
\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
\]
Substitute the values of length and width:
\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (25 + 9) = 2 \times 34 = 68
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The perimeter of the room is **68 feet**.",68.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The area of Kai's rectangular office is 225 square feet.  
Let the width of the room be \( w \) feet.  
Since the length is 16 feet longer than the width, the length is \( w + 16 \) feet.  

The formula for the area of a rectangle is:  
\[
\text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
\]  
Substituting the given values:  
\[
225 = w \times (w + 16)
\]  

Expanding the equation:  
\[
225 = w^2 + 16w
\]  

Rearranging into standard quadratic form:  
\[
w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0
\]  

Now, we solve this quadratic equation using factoring.  
We need two numbers that multiply to \(-225\) and add to \(16\). These numbers are \(25\) and \(-9\).  

Factoring the quadratic equation:  
\[
(w + 25)(w - 9) = 0
\]  

Setting each factor equal to 0:  
\[
w + 25 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad w - 9 = 0
\]  
\[
w = -25 \quad \text{or} \quad w = 9
\]  

Since width cannot be negative, we have \( w = 9 \).  

Now, the width of the room is \( 9 \) feet, and the length is:  
\[
w + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25 \, \text{feet}.
\]  

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:  
\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (25 + 9) = 2 \times 34 = 68 \, \text{feet}.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total length of the remaining remoras.
Each remora is **15 inches** long. To find the total length of the remaining 12 remoras:

- Total length of the remaining remoras:
  \[
  12 \times 15 = 180 \text{ inches}
  \]

---

### Step 3: Convert the shark's length to inches.
The shark is **75 feet** long. Since there are **12 inches in a foot**, the shark's length in inches is:

\[
75 \times 12 = 900 \text{ inches}
\]

---

### Step 4: Find the percentage of the shark's length that the remaining remoras' length represents.
To find the percentage, divide the total length of the remaining remoras by the shark's length, and then multiply by 100:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remaining remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{180}{900} \right) \times 100
\]

Simplify:
\[
\text{Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\%
\]

### Final Answer:
The combined length of the remaining remoras is **20% of the shark's body length**.",20.0,1,"Ali saw a 75-foot shark with 15 remoras, each 15 inches long. We need to calculate what percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remaining remoras after 1/5 of them go away.

### Step 1: Find the number of remoras that remain.
There are 15 remoras initially. If 1/5 of them go away, the number of remoras that leave is:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3
\]
So, the number of remaining remoras is:
\[
15 - 3 = 12
\]

### Step 2: Find the total length of the remaining remoras.
Each remora is 15 inches long. The total length of the 12 remaining remoras is:
\[
12 \times 15 = 180 \text{ inches.}
\]

### Step 3: Convert the total length of the remoras to feet.
Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 180 inches to feet:
\[
180 \div 12 = 15 \text{ feet.}
\]

### Step 4: Find the percentage of the shark's body length.
The shark is 75 feet long. The percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remaining remoras represents is:

### Final Answer:
Deshawn won't be able to place **11 crackers** on the bowls or plates.",11.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Each bowl can hold 21 crackers. Deshawn has 11 bowls.
   So, the total number of crackers the bowls can hold is:
   \( 21 \times 11 = 231 \).

2. Each plate can hold two times the number of crackers a bowl can hold. Since a bowl holds 21 crackers, each plate can hold:
   \( 21 \times 2 = 42 \) crackers.

3. Deshawn has 4 plates. So, the total number of crackers the plates can hold is:
   \( 42 \times 4 = 168 \).

4. The total number of crackers that can be placed on the bowls and plates is:
   \( 231 + 168 = 399 \).

5. Deshawn has 615 crackers in total. After placing 399 crackers on the bowls and plates, the number of crackers left is:
   \( 615 - 399 = 216 \).

6. Deshawn eats a third of the crackers. A third of 615 crackers is:
   \( 615 \div 3 = 205 \).

7. After eating 205 crackers, the number of crackers left is:
   \( 615 - 205 = 410 \).

p1,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,Benjamin hires a party bus from 2 PM to 6 PM. He gets 2 hours free. There is a fixed insurance cost of $25 as well. The first paid hour is $50 and each hour after that is twice the cost. How much did he pay?,175.0,"Let's break this problem into steps to calculate how much Benjamin paid for the party bus.

---

### Step 1: Determine the total duration of the rental
Benjamin hires the party bus from **2 PM to 6 PM**. The total duration is:

\[
6 \, \text{PM} - 2 \, \text{PM} = 4 \, \text{hours}.
\]

---

### Step 2: Account for the 2 free hours
Benjamin gets **2 hours free**, so the remaining **paid hours** are:

\[
4 \, \text{hours} - 2 \, \text{free hours} = 2 \, \text{paid hours}.
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the paid hours
The cost structure for the paid hours is as follows:
- The **first paid hour** costs **$50**.
- Each subsequent hour costs **twice the previous hour's cost**.

#### First paid hour:
\[
\text{Cost of the first hour} = 50 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

#### Second paid hour:
\[
\text{Cost of the second hour} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

#### Total cost for the paid hours:
\[
50 + 100 = 150 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

---

### Step 4: Add the fixed insurance cost
There is a fixed insurance cost of **$25**, so the total cost becomes:

\[
150 + 25 = 175 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Benjamin paid **$175** for the party bus.",175.0,1,"Benjamin hires the party bus from 2 PM to 6 PM. Let's calculate the total hours first.

- From 2 PM to 6 PM is 4 hours in total.
- He gets 2 hours free, so he only pays for 4 - 2 = 2 hours.

Now, let's calculate the cost for the paid hours:

1. The first paid hour costs $50.
2. Each hour after the first is twice the cost of the previous hour. So, the second hour costs 2 * $50 = $100.

Adding these costs together:
- The total cost for the paid hours is $50 + $100 = $150.

Finally, we add the fixed insurance cost of $25:
- The total amount Benjamin paid is $150 + $25 = $175.

The answer is $175.",175.0,1,1,,,,0,1,175.0,,,
p1,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Olga is required to submit a 176-page thesis. She already finished writing 3/4 of the thesis, and she has 4 more days until the submission deadline. On average, how many pages does she have left to write per day?",11.0,"We are tasked with finding how many pages Olga needs to write per day to complete her thesis on time. Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many pages Olga has already written.
Olga has completed **3/4** of her 176-page thesis. To find how many pages she has written:

\[
\text{Pages written} = \frac{3}{4} \times 176
\]

\[
\text{Pages written} = 132
\]

So, Olga has written **132 pages**.

---

### Step 2: Determine how many pages Olga has left to write.
The total number of pages in the thesis is 176. Subtract the pages she has already written:

\[
\text{Pages left to write} = 176 - 132
\]

\[
\text{Pages left to write} = 44
\]

Olga has **44 pages** left to write.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the average number of pages Olga needs to write per day.
Olga has **4 days** to complete the remaining 44 pages. To find the average number of pages she needs to write per day:

\[
\text{Pages per day} = \frac{\text{Pages left to write}}{\text{Number of days}}
\]

\[
\text{Pages per day} = \frac{44}{4}

He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 40% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of flour and he uses 3 kilograms of flour per day. He also decided to buy himself a bagel for ₣4. Since he shopped more than ₣50, he received a ₣23 discount. How much does Santiago have to pay?",275.0,"Let's break this problem into smaller steps to calculate how much Santiago has to pay.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the more expensive flour per kilogram.
The normal brand of flour costs ₣10 per kilogram. The more expensive brand costs **40% more**. To calculate the price of the more expensive brand:

\[
\text{Increase in price} = 10 \times 0.40 = 4
\]

\[
\text{Price of expensive flour} = 10 + 4 = 14 \, \text{(₣ per kilogram)}.
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of flour Santiago needs for a week.
Santiago uses **3 kilograms of flour per day**. For a week (7 days), the total amount of flour he needs is:

\[
\text{Total flour needed} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \, \text{kilograms}.
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the flour.
The cost of the more expensive flour is ₣14 per kilogram, and Santiago is buying 21 kilograms. The total cost of the flour is:

\[
\text{Total cost of flour} = 14 \times 21 = 294 \, \text{₣}.
\]

---

### Step 4: Add the cost of the bagel.
Santiago also buys a bagel for ₣4. Adding this to the cost of the flour:

\[
\text{Total cost before discount} = 294 + 4 = 298 \, \text{₣}.
\]

---

### Step 5: Apply the discount.
Since Santiago shopped for more than ₣50, he receives a ₣23 discount. Subtract the discount from the total cost:

\[
\text{Total cost after discount} = 298 - 23 = 275 \, \text{₣}.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Santiago has to pay **₣275**.",275.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the more expensive brand of flour per kilogram:**
   The normal brand costs ₣10 per kilogram.
   The more expensive brand costs 40% more. To calculate this:
   40% of ₣10 is \( 10 \times 0.4 = ₣4 \).
   So, the more expensive brand costs \( 10 + 4 = ₣14 \) per kilogram.

2. **Calculate the total amount of flour Santiago needs for a week:**
   Santiago uses 3 kilograms of flour per day.
   There are 7 days in a week, so he needs \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) kilograms of flour.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the flour:**
   The more expensive brand costs ₣14 per kilogram.
   Santiago buys 21 kilograms, so the total cost of the flour is:
   \( 14 \times 21 = ₣294 \).

4. **Add the cost of the bagel:**
   Santiago also buys a bagel for ₣4.
   Adding this to the cost of the flour:
   \( 294 + 4 = ₣298 \).

5. **Apply the discount:**
   Since Santiago shopped for more than ₣50, he receives a ₣23 discount.

It takes them another 29 minutes to get to the mall. It will then take double the combined amount they have spent so far to reach the park. How much longer do they have to get to cinema without being late, if they have already wasted 32 minutes to get a coffee before their walk?",44.0,"We are tasked with determining how much time Xavier and Carlos have left to get to the cinema without being late. Let’s break this problem into steps.

---

### Step 1: Total time available
Xavier and Carlos have **229 minutes** in total to get to the cinema.

---

### Step 2: Time spent so far
1. **Time to the library**: 22 minutes.
2. **Time to the mall**: 29 minutes.
3. **Time wasted getting coffee**: 32 minutes.

Adding these together:
\[
22 + 29 + 32 = 83 \, \text{minutes spent so far.}
\]

---

### Step 3: Time to the park
The problem states that it will take **double the combined amount of time they have spent so far** to reach the park. So, we first calculate the combined time spent so far (library + mall):
\[
22 + 29 = 51 \, \text{minutes.}
\]
The time to the park is **double this amount**:
\[
2 \times 51 = 102 \, \text{minutes.}

---

### Final Answer:
Xavier and Carlos have **44 minutes** left to get to the cinema without being late.",44.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Xavier and Carlos have a total of 229 minutes to walk to the cinema.

2. It takes them 22 minutes to get to the corner where the library is.  
   It then takes them another 29 minutes to get to the mall.  
   So, the total time spent so far is:  
   \( 22 + 29 = 51 \) minutes.

3. It will take **double the combined amount they have spent so far** to reach the park.  
   The combined amount spent so far is 51 minutes.  
   Double this time is:  
   \( 2 \times 51 = 102 \) minutes.  
   So, it will take 102 minutes to reach the park.

4. Adding the time spent so far (51 minutes) and the time to reach the park (102 minutes), the total time spent to reach the park is:  
   \( 51 + 102 = 153 \) minutes.

5. They have already wasted 32 minutes to get a coffee before their walk.  
   Adding this wasted time to the total time spent so far:  
   \( 153 + 32 = 185 \) minutes.

6. They have 229 minutes in total to get to the cinema.  
   Subtracting the total time spent so far (185 minutes) from the total time available (229 minutes):  
   \( 229 - 185 = 44 \) minutes.

If he makes 8 giant cubes, 24 small cubes, 15 medium cubes, and eight tiny cubes, how many grams of water does he have left?",76.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for the ice cubes Oliver makes and subtract it from the total amount of water he has (344 grams). Let's break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the water used for the **giant cubes**.
Each giant cube uses **12 grams** of water, and Oliver makes **8 giant cubes**.  
\[
\text{Water used for giant cubes} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \, \text{grams}.
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the water used for the **medium cubes**.
Each medium cube uses **11 grams** of water, and Oliver makes **15 medium cubes**.  
\[
\text{Water used for medium cubes} = 15 \times 11 = 165 \, \text{grams}.
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the water used for the **small cubes**.
Each small cube uses **1/4 gram** of water, and Oliver makes **24 small cubes**.  
\[
\text{Water used for small cubes} = 24 \times \frac{1}{4} = 24 \div 4 = 6 \, \text{grams}.
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the water used for the **tiny cubes**.
Each tiny cube is **half the size of a small cube**, so each tiny cube uses:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{8} \, \text{gram}.
\]
Oliver makes **8 tiny cubes**, so:
\[
\text{Water used for tiny cubes} = 8 \times \frac{1}{8} = 1 \, \text{gram}.
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the total water used.
Now, add up the water used for all the cubes:
\[
\text{Total water used} = 96 + 165 + 6 + 1 = 268 \, \text{grams}.
\]

---

### Step 6: Calculate the water left.
Oliver starts with **344 grams** of water. Subtract the total water used:
\[
\text{Water left} = 344 - 268 = 76 \, \text{grams}.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Oliver has **76 grams** of water left.",76.0,1,"Oliver starts with 344 grams of water. Let's calculate how much water he uses for each type of ice cube and then subtract the total from 344 grams.

### Step 1: Calculate the water used for 8 giant cubes
Each giant cube uses 12 grams of water.  
For 8 giant cubes:  
\( 8 \times 12 = 96 \) grams.  
So, 96 grams are used for the giant cubes.

### Step 2: Calculate the water used for 15 medium cubes
Each medium cube uses 11 grams of water.  
For 15 medium cubes:  
\( 15 \times 11 = 165 \) grams.  
So, 165 grams are used for the medium cubes.

### Step 3: Calculate the water used for 24 small cubes
Each small cube uses \( \frac{1}{4} \) gram of water.  
For 24 small cubes:  
\( 24 \times \frac{1}{4} = 6 \) grams.  
So, 6 grams are used for the small cubes.

### Step 4: Calculate the water used for 8 tiny cubes
Each tiny cube is half the size of a small cube.  
Since a small cube uses \( \frac{1}{4} \) gram, a tiny cube uses:  
\( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{8} \) gram.  
For 8 tiny cubes:  
\( 8 \times \frac{1}{8} = 1 \) gram.  
So, 1 gram is used for the tiny cubes.

### Step 5: Calculate the total water used
Now, add up the water used for all the cubes:

p1,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"A group of 160 students has various hobbies. 34 like to bake, 6 like to play hurling, and the rest like to either paint or read. How many like to paint if the number that like to read is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing hurling?",99.0,"We are tasked with finding how many students like to paint. Let's break this problem into steps.

---

### Step 1: Define the variables
- Total number of students = 160
- Number of students who like to bake = 34
- Number of students who like to play hurling = 6
- Let \( x \) represent the number of students who like to paint.
- Let \( y \) represent the number of students who like to read.

---

### Step 2: Express the relationship between painting and reading
We are told that the number of students who like to read is **3 less than four times the number of students who like to play hurling**. Since 6 students like to play hurling, we can write:
\[
y = 4(6) - 3
\]
\[
y = 24 - 3 = 21
\]
So, \( y = 21 \), meaning 21 students like to read.

---

### Step 3: Use the total number of students to find \( x \)
The total number of students is 160, and they are divided into four groups: those who like to bake, play hurling, paint, and read. Therefore, we can write:
\[
\text{Number of students who bake} + \text{Number of students who play hurling} + \text{Number of students who paint} + \text{Number of students who read} = 160
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
34 + 6 + x + 21 = 160
\]
Simplify:
\[
61 + x = 160
\]
Solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 160 - 61
\]
\[
x = 99
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The number of students who like to paint is **99**.",99.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The total number of students is 160.  
34 students like to bake, and 6 students like to play hurling.  
The rest of the students either like to paint or read.  

First, let's calculate how many students like to paint or read:  
The total number of students is 160.  
Subtract the students who like to bake and play hurling:  
160 - 34 - 6 = 120.  
So, 120 students like to either paint or read.

Next, we are told that the number of students who like to read is 3 less than four times the number of students who like to play hurling.  
The number of students who like to play hurling is 6.  
Four times this number is:  
4 * 6 = 24.  
Now subtract 3:  
24 - 3 = 21.  
So, 21 students like to read.

Finally, let's find how many students like to paint:  
The total number of students who like to paint or read is 120.  
Subtract the number of students who like to read:  
120 - 21 = 99.  
So, 99 students like to paint.

He has applied for help from the youth club, which has decided to cover a tenth of the cost of the music festival. His friends have also chipped in and will cover 1/2 of the music festival. How much money is Yuki missing if he has ¥15 and the music festival costs ¥490?",181.0,"To determine how much money Yuki is missing, let's break the problem into steps:

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total contributions from the youth club and Yuki's friends.

1. **Youth club's contribution**:  
   The youth club will cover **1/10** of the cost of the music festival.  
   The cost of the music festival is ¥490.  
   \[
   \text{Youth club's contribution} = \frac{1}{10} \times 490 = 49 \, \text{yen}.
   \]

2. **Friends' contribution**:  
   Yuki's friends will cover **1/2** of the cost of the music festival.  
   \[
   \text{Friends' contribution} = \frac{1}{2} \times 490 = 245 \, \text{yen}.
   \]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount covered by the youth club and Yuki's friends.

\[
\text{Total contributions} = \text{Youth club's contribution} + \text{Friends' contribution}
\]
\[
\text{Total contributions} = 49 + 245 = 294 \, \text{yen}.
\]

---

### Step 3: Determine how much of the cost is still uncovered.

The total cost of the music festival is ¥490. The amount uncovered is:
\[
\text{Uncovered cost} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total contributions}
\]
\[
\text{Uncovered cost} = 490 - 294 = 196 \, \text{yen}.
\]

---

### Step 4: Subtract Yuki's current savings from the uncovered cost.

Yuki currently has ¥15. The amount he is still missing is:
\[
\text{Amount missing} = \text{Uncovered cost} - \text{Yuki's savings}
\]
\[
\text{Amount missing} = 196 - 15 = 181 \, \text{yen}.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Yuki is missing **¥181**.",181.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The total cost of the music festival is ¥490.  
The youth club will cover a tenth of the cost.  
A tenth of ¥490 is \( 490 \div 10 = 49 \).  
So, the youth club will contribute ¥49.

Yuki's friends will cover half of the cost.  
Half of ¥490 is \( 490 \div 2 = 245 \).  
So, Yuki's friends will contribute ¥245.

Now, let's calculate the total amount covered by the youth club and Yuki's friends.  
The total contribution is \( 49 + 245 = 294 \).  

The total cost of the music festival is ¥490, and ¥294 is already covered.  
The remaining amount is \( 490 - 294 = 196 \).  

Yuki already has ¥15.  
The amount Yuki is missing is \( 196 - 15 = 181 \).

How much more do 8 loaves of bread cost than 4 croissants?,35.0,"We are tasked with finding how much more 8 loaves of bread cost than 4 croissants. Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the cost of a croissant
The cost of a croissant is **three-fourths** of the cost of a loaf of bread. Since a loaf of bread costs ₣7, we calculate:

\[
\text{Cost of a croissant} = \frac{3}{4} \times 7 = \frac{21}{4} = 5.25
\]

So, the cost of a croissant is **₣5.25**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of 8 loaves of bread
The cost of one loaf of bread is ₣7. Therefore, the cost of 8 loaves of bread is:

\[
\text{Cost of 8 loaves} = 8 \times 7 = 56
\]

So, 8 loaves of bread cost **₣56**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of 4 croissants
The cost of one croissant is ₣5.25. Therefore, the cost of 4 croissants is:

\[
\text{Cost of 4 croissants} = 4 \times 5.25 = 21
\]

So, 4 croissants cost **₣21**.

---

### Step 4: Find the difference in cost
Now, we find how much more 8 loaves of bread cost than 4 croissants:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Cost of 8 loaves} - \text{Cost of 4 croissants} = 56 - 21 = 35
\]

---

### Final Answer:
8 loaves of bread cost **₣35 more** than 4 croissants.",4.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

The cost of a loaf of bread is ₣7.  
The cost of a croissant is three-fourths of the cost of a loaf of bread.

### Final Answer:
Noah has **¥328** left.",328.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Noah starts with 7 ¥50 bills.  
The total amount of money he has is:  
7 * ¥50 = ¥350.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the puzzles.  
Each puzzle costs ¥4, and he buys 2 puzzles.  
The total cost of the puzzles without a discount is:  
2 * ¥4 = ¥8.  
He receives a 25% discount on the puzzles.  
The discount amount is:  
25% of ¥8 = 0.25 * ¥8 = ¥2.  
So, the discounted cost of the puzzles is:  
¥8 - ¥2 = ¥6.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencil packs.  
Each pack of pencils costs ¥5, and he buys 4 packs.  
The total cost of the pencils without a discount is:  
4 * ¥5 = ¥20.  
He receives a 20% discount on the pencils.  
The discount amount is:  
20% of ¥20 = 0.20 * ¥20 = ¥4.

Question: A new infection infects 27 people. Every day, each infected person infects 3 others. How many people are infected after 3 days?
Your initial answer was: Let's think step by step.

On Day 0, there are 27 infected people initially.

On Day 1, each of the 27 infected people infects 3 others.  
So, the number of new infections on Day 1 is 27 * 3 = 81.  
The total number of infected people by the end of Day 1 is 27 + 81 = 108.

On Day 2, each of the 81 newly infected people from Day 1 infects 3 others.  
So, the number of new infections on Day 2 is 81 * 3 = 243.  
The total number of infected people by the end of Day 2 is 108 + 243 = 351.

On Day 3, each of the 243 newly infected people from Day 2 infects 3 others.  
So, the number of new infections on Day 3 is 243 * 3 = 729.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","### Explanation:
The initial answer was incorrect because it misunderstood the problem's structure. The error lies in how the total number of infected people was calculated. The problem involves exponential growth, not cumulative addition. Each infected person infects 3 others, and the total number of infected people grows multiplicatively, not additively. The mistake was in adding the new infections to the previous total instead of calculating the total number of infections directly for each day.

### Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of exponential growth
- Conceptual error
- Logical reasoning error
- Incorrect problem structure

---

### Correct Solution (Step-by-Step):
1. **Understand the problem**: Each infected person infects 3 others every day. This is a case of exponential growth, where the total number of infected people triples each day.

2. **Day 0 (Initial condition)**:  
   On Day 0, there are 27 infected people.

3. **Day 1**:  
   Each of the 27 infected people infects 3 others.  
   Total number of infected people = \( 27 \times 3 = 81 \).

4. **Day 2**:  
   Each of the 81 infected people infects 3 others.  
   Total number of infected people = \( 81 \times 3 = 243 \).

5. **Day 3**:  
   Each of the 243 infected people infects 3 others.  
   Total number of infected people = \( 243 \times 3 = 729 \).

6. **Final Total**:  
   After 3 days, the total number of infected people is **729**.

### Correct Answer: **729**

---

### Instructions for Solving This Problem in the Future:
1. Identify whether the problem involves cumulative addition or exponential growth.
2. Determine the initial number of infected people (Day 0).
3. For each subsequent day, multiply the total number of infected people from the previous day by the infection rate (in this case, 3).
4. Repeat the multiplication for the required number of days.
5. Do not add the new infections to the previous total unless explicitly stated in the problem.
6. Double-check the problem's wording to ensure the correct interpretation of growth (additive vs. multiplicative).
7. Verify calculations for each step to avoid arithmetic errors.

---

### General Advice for Solving Similar Problems:
1. **Understand the growth type**: Determine whether the problem involves linear, additive, or exponential growth.
2. **Break the problem into steps**: Solve for each day or stage sequentially.
3. **Use clear notation**: Keep track of the total number of infected people and the new infections separately if needed.
4. **Double-check the problem's structure**: Ensure you are applying the correct mathematical model (e.g., multiplication for exponential growth).
5. **Verify calculations**: Recheck each step to avoid arithmetic or logical errors.
6. **Practice exponential growth problems**: Familiarize yourself with similar problems to build intuition for this type of question.

Solution:  
The tree grows as follows:  
- Year 1: 2 feet  
- Year 2: 2 × 2 = 4 feet  
- Year 3: 4 × 2 = 8 feet  
- Year 4: 8 × 2 = 16 feet  
The total height of the tree after 4 years is 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30 feet.

1. Identify whether the problem involves exponential growth, linear growth, or another type of progression.  
2. Carefully read the problem to understand the growth pattern (e.g., doubling, tripling, etc.).  
3. Write out the growth for each step or time period explicitly.  
4. Add up the total growth step-by-step to avoid missing any contributions.  
5. Double-check the calculations to ensure the correct growth pattern was applied.  

Advice:  
- Always confirm the type of growth described in the problem (e.g., exponential, linear, or other).  
- Write out each step of the progression explicitly to avoid skipping or miscalculating terms.  
- Verify your calculations by re-checking the growth pattern and summing the results.

#### Explanation:
I misunderstood the nature of the problem and incorrectly calculated the total number of infected people. The problem involves exponential growth, where each infected person infects 3 others every day. Instead of correctly modeling the progression of infections over time, I likely made an error in either the growth calculation or the summation of infected individuals. My previous answer of 1080.0 suggests I may have miscalculated the total number of infections by either overestimating or misapplying the growth pattern.

#### Error Keywords:

2. Miscalculating total infected
3. Ignoring initial conditions or progression steps

---

### Correct Solution (Step-by-Step):

#### Problem Restatement:
- Initial number of infected people: 27
- Each infected person infects 3 others every day.
- We need to calculate the total number of infected people after 3 days.

#### Step 1: Understand the growth pattern.
Each infected person infects 3 others, meaning the number of new infections triples each day. This is exponential growth. The total number of infected people at the end of each day includes both the previously infected people and the newly infected people.

#### Step 2: Calculate the number of infections for each day.
- **Day 0 (Initial condition):** 27 people are infected.
- **Day 1:** Each of the 27 people infects 3 others.  
  New infections = \( 27 \times 3 = 81 \).  
  Total infected = \( 27 + 81 = 108 \).
- **Day 2:** Each of the 81 newly infected people infects 3 others.  
  New infections = \( 81 \times 3 = 243 \).  
  Total infected = \( 108 + 243 = 351 \).
- **Day 3:** Each of the 243 newly infected people infects 3 others.  
  New infections = \( 243 \times 3 = 729 \).  
  Total infected = \( 351 + 729 = 1080 \).

#### Step 3: Verify the calculations.
- Day 0: 27 infected (initial condition).
- Day 1: 27 + 81 = 108 infected.
- Day 2: 108 + 243 = 351 infected.
- Day 3: 351 + 729 = 1080 infected.

#### Final Answer:
The total number of infected people after 3 days is **1080**.

Question: A new infection infects 27 people. Every day, each infected person infects 3 others. How many people are infected after 3 days?
Your initial answer was: Let's think step by step.

On Day 0, there are 27 infected people initially.

On Day 1, each of the 27 infected people infects 3 others.  
So, the number of new infections on Day 1 is 27 * 3 = 81.  
The total number of infected people by the end of Day 1 is 27 + 81 = 108.

#### Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the total number of infected people after 3 days because I misunderstood the nature of the problem. I likely treated the infection growth as a single compounding event or miscalculated the progression of infections over multiple days. Specifically, I may have failed to account for the fact that the total number of infected people includes both the newly infected individuals and the previously infected individuals.

#### Error Keywords:
1. Misunderstanding exponential growth
2. Misinterpreting the problem
3. Failing to account for cumulative totals
4. Incorrectly summing or compounding values

---

### Correct Solution (Step-by-Step)

#### Problem Restatement:
The infection starts with 27 people. Each day, every infected person infects 3 others. We need to calculate the **total number of infected people** after 3 days.

#### Step 1: Understand the growth process.
- On Day 0 (initial state), there are 27 infected people.
- On each subsequent day, every infected person infects 3 new people. This means the number of **new infections** each day is proportional to the total number of infected people from the previous day.

#### Step 2: Calculate the number of new infections each day.
- **Day 0 (initial):** 27 infected people.
- **Day 1:** Each of the 27 people infects 3 others.  
  New infections = \( 27 \times 3 = 81 \).  
  Total infected = \( 27 + 81 = 108 \).
- **Day 2:** Each of the 108 people infects 3 others.  
  New infections = \( 108 \times 3 = 324 \).  
  Total infected = \( 108 + 324 = 432 \).
- **Day 3:** Each of the 432 people infects 3 others.  
  New infections = \( 432 \times 3 = 1296 \).  
  Total infected = \( 432 + 1296 = 1728 \).

#### Step 3: Final Answer
After 3 days, the total number of infected people is **1728**.

Each anchor costs €0.84. How much money does Leilani have left after paying for the items?",37.0,"To determine how much money Leilani has left after buying the items, we need to calculate the total cost of the anchors and screws, then subtract that from her initial amount of €79.07. Let's break it down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the anchors
Each anchor costs €0.84, and Leilani wants to buy 45 anchors. The total cost of the anchors is:

\[
\text{Cost of anchors} = 45 \times 0.84
\]

\[
\text{Cost of anchors} = 37.80
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the screws
Each screw costs €0.61, and Leilani needs 7 screws. The total cost of the screws is:

\[
\text{Cost of screws} = 7 \times 0.61
\]

\[
\text{Cost of screws} = 4.27
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of all items
The total cost of all items is the sum of the cost of the anchors and the cost of the screws:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of anchors} + \text{Cost of screws}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 37.80 + 4.27

### Step 4: Calculate how much money Leilani has left
Leilani starts with €79.07. After spending €42.07, the amount of money she has left is:

\[
\text{Money left} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total cost}

How many days will the cake last?,4.0,"We are tasked with determining how many days the cake will last if Wei, DeShawn, and Roya eat portions of the cake daily. Let's break this problem into steps.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many portions each person eats daily.
- **Wei** eats **3 portions per day**.
- **DeShawn** eats **three times as much as Wei**:
  \[
  3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ portions per day.}
  \]
- **Roya** eats **twice as much as DeShawn**:
  \[
  2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ portions per day.}
  \]

Thus, the daily consumption for each person is:
- Wei: 3 portions,
- DeShawn: 9 portions,
- Roya: 18 portions.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total daily consumption.
The total number of portions eaten by all three people per day is:
\[
3 + 9 + 18 = 30 \text{ portions per day.}
\]

---

### Step 3: Determine how many days the cake will last.
The cake has **120 portions**. To find how many days it will last, divide the total number of portions by the daily consumption:
\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total portions}}{\text{Daily consumption}} = \frac{120}{30} = 4 \text{ days.}

---

### Final Answer:
The cake will last **4 days**.",4.0,1,"Wei can eat 3 portions a day.  
DeShawn can eat three times as much as Wei, so he eats 3 * 3 = 9 portions a day.  
Roya can eat twice as much as DeShawn, so she eats 9 * 2 = 18 portions a day.  

Now, let's find the total portions eaten by all three in one day:  
Wei eats 3 portions, DeShawn eats 9 portions, and Roya eats 18 portions.  
So, the total portions eaten in one day is 3 + 9 + 18 = 30 portions.  

The giant cake has 120 portions. To find how many days the cake will last, we divide the total portions by the portions eaten per day:

Each cow eats as much as a goat and alpaca eat combined. If there are 21 goats, 7 alpacas, and 21 cows, how many kilograms of grain does Alejandro need?",798.0,"To solve this problem, we will calculate the total amount of grain needed for each type of animal and then sum them up.

---

### Step 1: Determine the grain requirements for each type of animal.

1. **Grain needed for each goat:**
   Each goat needs **9 kilograms** of grain.

2. **Grain needed for each alpaca:**
   Each alpaca needs **3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs**.  
   Twice the amount each goat needs is:  
   \[
   2 \times 9 = 18 \, \text{kilograms}.
   \]  
   Subtract 3 kilograms:  
   \[
   18 - 3 = 15 \, \text{kilograms}.
   \]  
   So, each alpaca needs **15 kilograms** of grain.

3. **Grain needed for each cow:**
   Each cow eats as much as a goat and an alpaca eat combined.  
   A goat eats **9 kilograms**, and an alpaca eats **15 kilograms**, so:  
   \[
   9 + 15 = 24 \, \text{kilograms}.
   \]  
   Each cow needs **24 kilograms** of grain.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total grain needed for each type of animal.

1. **Total grain for goats:**
   There are **21 goats**, and each goat needs **9 kilograms** of grain.  
   Total grain for goats:  
   \[
   21 \times 9 = 189 \, \text{kilograms}.
   \]

2. **Total grain for alpacas:**
   There are **7 alpacas**, and each alpaca needs **15 kilograms** of grain.  
   Total grain for alpacas:  
   \[
   7 \times 15 = 105 \, \text{kilograms}.

\]

---

### Final Answer:
Alejandro needs **798 kilograms** of grain.",798.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine how much grain each animal eats:**
   - Each goat needs 9 kilograms of grain.
   - Each alpaca needs 3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs. Twice the amount each goat needs is \( 2 \times 9 = 18 \). Subtract 3: \( 18 - 3 = 15 \). So, each alpaca needs 15 kilograms of grain.
   - Each cow eats as much as a goat and an alpaca eat combined. A goat eats 9 kilograms, and an alpaca eats 15 kilograms. So, each cow eats \( 9 + 15 = 24 \) kilograms of grain.

2. **Calculate the total grain needed for each type of animal:**

Due to the flu season, 35 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.",50.0,"To solve this problem, we will calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the number of beds occupied initially.
The hospital has a total capacity of **800 beds**, and **1/8 of the beds are occupied**.

\[
\text{Occupied beds initially} = \frac{1}{8} \times 800 = 100
\]

So, **100 beds are occupied initially**.

---

### Step 2: Determine the number of beds out of service.
**1/5 of all the beds are out of service**.

\[
\text{Beds out of service} = \frac{1}{5} \times 800 = 160
\]

So, **160 beds are out of service**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the number of beds available for use.
The total number of beds available for use is the total capacity minus the beds out of service:

\[
\text{Beds available for use} = 800 - 160 = 640
\]

So, **640 beds are available for use**.

---

### Step 4: Determine the number of unoccupied beds initially.
The number of unoccupied beds initially is the number of beds available for use minus the number of beds already occupied:

\[
\text{Unoccupied beds initially} = \text{Beds available for use} - \text{Occupied beds initially}
\]

\[
\text{Unoccupied beds initially} = 640 - 100 = 540
\]

So, **540 beds are unoccupied initially**.

---

### Step 5: Calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks.
Each day, **35 patients are admitted**. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted is:

\[
\text{Patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 35 \times 14 = 490
\]

So, **490 patients are admitted over 2 weeks**.

---

### Step 6: Determine the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks.
Initially, there were **100 occupied beds**, and **490 more patients are admitted**. The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is:

\[
\text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = \text{Occupied beds initially} + \text{Patients admitted in 2 weeks}
\]

\[
\text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 100 + 490 = 590
\]

So, **590 beds are occupied after 2 weeks**.

---

### Step 7: Calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.
The number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is the number of beds available for use minus the number of occupied beds:

\[
\text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = \text{Beds available for use} - \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks}
\]

\[
\text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 640 - 590 = 50
\",50.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of beds in the hospital.**  
   The hospital has a total capacity of 800 beds.

2. **Calculate the number of beds that are occupied.**  
   One-eighth of the beds are occupied.  
   The number of occupied beds is:  
   \( 800 \times \frac{1}{8} = 100 \).

3. **Calculate the number of beds that are out of service.**  
   One-fifth of all the beds are out of service.  
   The number of out-of-service beds is:  
   \( 800 \times \frac{1}{5} = 160 \).

4. **Calculate the number of beds that are initially unoccupied and available.**  
   The total number of unoccupied and available beds is:  
   \( 800 - (\text{occupied beds} + \text{out-of-service beds}) \).  
   Substituting the values:  
   \( 800 - (100 + 160) = 800 - 260 = 540 \).  
   So, there are 540 unoccupied and available beds initially.

5. **Determine the number of patients admitted each day.**  
   Each day, 35 patients are admitted into the hospital.

6. **Calculate the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks.**  
   There are 14 days in 2 weeks.  
   The total number of patients admitted is:  
   \( 35 \times 14 = 490 \).

7. **Calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.**  
   Initially, there were 540 unoccupied and available beds.  
   After admitting 490 patients, the number of unoccupied beds is:

On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday and 28 boxes of orange pie. On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the cupcake cost ₺10 and the orange pie cost ₺22, how much was Andre's average daily earning?",980.0,"To solve this problem, we will break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the variables
Let:
- \( C_M \): Number of boxes of cupcakes sold on Monday.
- \( O_M \): Number of boxes of orange pies sold on Monday.
- \( C_T \): Number of boxes of cupcakes sold on Tuesday.
- \( O_T \): Number of boxes of orange pies sold on Tuesday.
- \( C_W \): Number of boxes of cupcakes sold on Wednesday.
- \( O_W \): Number of boxes of orange pies sold on Wednesday.

From the problem:
- \( C_M = 24 \) (Andre sold 24 boxes of cupcakes on Monday).
- \( O_M = O_T - 16 \) (Andre sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pies on Monday than on Tuesday).
- \( C_T = C_M + 11 = 24 + 11 = 35 \) (Andre sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes on Tuesday than on Monday).
- \( O_T = 28 \) (Andre sold 28 boxes of orange pies on Tuesday).

---

### Step 2: Calculate the number of boxes sold on Monday
From the above:
- \( C_M = 24 \) (cupcakes on Monday).
- \( O_M = O_T - 16 = 28 - 16 = 12 \) (orange pies on Monday).

So, on Monday, Andre sold:
- 24 boxes of cupcakes.
- 12 boxes of orange pies.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the number of boxes sold on Tuesday
From the above:
- \( C_T = 35 \) (cupcakes on Tuesday).
- \( O_T = 28 \) (orange pies on Tuesday).

So, on Tuesday, Andre sold:
- 35 boxes of cupcakes.
- 28 boxes of orange pies.

---

### Step 4: Calculate the number of boxes sold on Wednesday
On Wednesday, Andre sold as much as he did on Monday and Tuesday combined. This means:
\[
C_W = C_M + C_T = 24 + 35 = 59
\]
\[
O_W = O_M + O_T = 12 + 28 = 40
\]

So, on Wednesday, Andre sold:
- 59 boxes of cupcakes.
- 40 boxes of orange pies.

---

### Step 5: Calculate the total earnings for each day
The cost of one box of cupcakes is ₺10, and the cost of one box of orange pies is ₺22.

#### Monday's earnings:
\[
\text{Monday earnings} = (C_M \times 10) + (O_M \times 22)
\]
\[
\text{Monday earnings} = (24 \times 10) + (12 \times 22) = 240 + 264 = 504
\]

#### Tuesday's earnings:
\[
\text{Tuesday earnings} = (C_T \times 10) + (O_T \times 22)
\]
\[
\text{Tuesday earnings} = (35 \times 10) + (28 \times 22) = 350 + 616 = 966
\]

#### Wednesday's earnings:
\[
\text{Wednesday earnings} = (C_W \times 10) + (O_W \times 22)
\]
\[
\text{Wednesday earnings} = (59 \times 10) + (40 \times 22) = 590 + 880 = 1470
\]

---

### Step 6: Calculate the total earnings and average daily earnings
The total earnings over the three days are:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Monday earnings} + \text{Tuesday earnings} + \text{Wednesday earnings}
\]
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 504 + 966 + 1470 = 2940
\]

The average daily earnings are:
\[
\text{Average daily earnings} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{3}
\]
\[
\text{Average daily earnings} = \frac{2940}{3} = 980
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Andre's average daily earning is **₺980**.",980.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many boxes of cupcakes and orange pies Andre sold each day.

#### Monday:
- Andre sold **24 boxes of cupcakes**.
- He sold **16 fewer boxes of orange pies than on Tuesday**. We'll calculate this after determining Tuesday's orange pie sales.

#### Tuesday:
- Andre sold **11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday**. Since he sold 24 boxes of cupcakes on Monday, on Tuesday he sold:
  \[
  24 + 11 = 35 \text{ boxes of cupcakes}.
  \]
- He sold **28 boxes of orange pies**.

#### Monday's orange pie sales:
- On Monday, Andre sold **16 fewer boxes of orange pies than on Tuesday**. Since he sold 28 boxes of orange pies on Tuesday, on Monday he sold:
  \[
  28 - 16 = 12 \text{ boxes of orange pies}.
  \]

#### Wednesday:
- On Wednesday, Andre sold **as much as he did in the past two days combined**. Let's calculate the total sales for Monday and Tuesday:
  - Total cupcakes sold on Monday and Tuesday:
    \[
    24 + 35 = 59 \text{ boxes of cupcakes}.
    \]
  - Total orange pies sold on Monday and Tuesday:
    \[
    12 + 28 = 40 \text{ boxes of orange pies}.
    \]
  - So, on Wednesday, Andre sold:
    \[
    59 \text{ boxes of cupcakes and } 40 \text{ boxes of orange pies}.
    \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total earnings for each day.

#### Monday's earnings:
- Earnings from cupcakes:
  \[
  24 \times 10 = ₺240.
  \]
- Earnings from orange pies:
  \[
  12 \times 22 = ₺264.
  \]
- Total earnings on Monday:
  \[
  ₺240 + ₺264 = ₺504.
  \]

#### Tuesday's earnings:
- Earnings from cupcakes:
  \[
  35 \times 10 = ₺350.
  \]
- Earnings from orange pies:
  \[
  28 \times 22 = ₺616.
  \]
- Total earnings on Tuesday:
  \[
  ₺350 + ₺616 = ₺966.
  \]

#### Wednesday's earnings:
- Earnings from cupcakes:
  \[
  59 \times 10 = ₺590.
  \]
- Earnings from orange pies:
  \[
  40 \times 22 = ₺880.
  \]
- Total earnings on Wednesday:
  \[
  ₺590 + ₺880 = ₺1,470.
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total earnings for all three days.
- Total earnings:
  \[
  ₺504 + ₺966 + ₺1,470 = ₺2,940.
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate the average daily earnings.
- There are 3 days in total. The average daily earnings are:

\text{Number of volleyball players} = 24\% \times 125 = 0.24 \times 125 = 30
\]

So, there are **30 volleyball players**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the number of volleyball players leaving early.
We are told that **half of the volleyball players are absent due to sickness**. This means only half of the volleyball players will leave early.

\[
\text{Volleyball players leaving early} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

So, **15 volleyball players** will leave early.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the number of students who are robotics club members or choir members.
The remaining students in the class are those who are **not volleyball players**. To find this number, subtract the number of volleyball players from the total number of students:

\[
\text{Remaining students} = 125 - 30 = 95
\]

We are told that **40% of the remaining students are robotics club members or choir members**. Calculate this:

\[
\text{Number of robotics/choir members} = 40\% \times 95 = 0.40 \times 95 = 38
\]

So, there are **38 robotics club members or choir members**.

---

### Step 4: Total number of students leaving early (excluding cheerleaders).
The students leaving early are:
- **15 volleyball players** (from Step 2),
- **38 robotics/choir members** (from Step 3).

Add these together:

\[
\text{Total students leaving early (excluding cheerleaders)} = 15 + 38 = 53
\]

So, **53 students** (excluding cheerleaders) are leaving early.

---

### Step 5: Calculate the number of cheerleaders accompanying the groups.
We are told that **3 cheerleaders will accompany each group**. There are **3 groups**: volleyball players, robotics club members, and choir members. Therefore, the total number of cheerleaders is:

\[
\text{Number of cheerleaders} = 3 \times 3 = 9
\]

So, **9 cheerleaders** will accompany the groups.

---

### Step 6: Calculate the total number of people leaving early.
The total number of people leaving early includes the students and the cheerleaders:

\[
\text{Total people leaving early} = 53 + 9 = 62
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The total number of people leaving early to the competition is **62**.",62.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the number of volleyball players in the class:**
   - 24% of the class are volleyball players.

2. **Account for the volleyball players who are absent:**
   - Half of the volleyball players are absent due to being sick.
   - The number of volleyball players leaving early is \( 30 \div 2 = 15 \).

3. **Determine the number of students in the remaining class:**
   - The remaining class is the total class minus the volleyball players.
   - The number of remaining students is \( 125 - 30 = 95 \).

4. **Determine the number of robotics club members or choir members:**
   - 40% of the remaining class are robotics club members or choir members.
   - The number of robotics club or choir members is \( 95 \times 0.40 = 38 \).

5. **Calculate the total number of students leaving early:**
   - The groups leaving early are the volleyball players and the robotics/choir members.
   - The total number of students leaving early is \( 15 + 38 = 53 \).

6. **Account for the cheerleaders accompanying the groups:**
   - 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of the 3 groups (volleyball players, robotics club members, and choir members).
   - The total number of cheerleaders is \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \).

7. **Add the cheerleaders to the total number of students leaving early:**

p1,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Mei has a flower bed that is 143 feet long. Mei wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Mei's flowers grow 3feet wide so she needs to leave 13 feet between every plant (including the plants width). Mei already owns 8 flowers. Each flowering plant costs €9 at the store. However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a €5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Mei spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",22.0,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Determine the total space required for each plant
Each plant is **3 feet wide**, and Mei needs to leave **13 feet of space** between each plant (including the plant's width). This means the total space required for each plant is:

\[
13 \, \text{feet (space between plants)} = 3 \, \text{feet (plant width)} + 10 \, \text{feet (gap between plants)}.
\]

So, each plant occupies **13 feet** of the flower bed.

---

### Step 2: Calculate how many plants Mei needs
The flower bed is **143 feet long**. To determine how many plants Mei can fit, divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:

\[
\text{Number of plants} = \frac{\text{Length of flower bed}}{\text{Space per plant}} = \frac{143}{13}.
\]

Perform the division:

\[
143 \div 13 = 11.
\]

So, Mei can fit **11 plants** in her flower bed.

---

### Step 3: Determine how many plants Mei needs to buy
Mei already owns **8 flowers**, but she needs **11 flowers** in total. Therefore, the number of flowers she needs to buy is:

\[
\text{Flowers to buy} = 11 - 8 = 3.
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of the flowers Mei needs to buy
Each flowering plant costs **€9**. If Mei buys **3 plants**, the total cost before any discount is:

\[
\text{Total cost before discount} = 3 \times 9 = 27 \, \text{euros}.
\]

Since Mei is buying more than 2 plants, she qualifies for a **€5 discount**. Subtract the discount from the total cost:

\[
\text{Total cost after discount} = 27 - 5 = 22 \, \text{euros}.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Mei will spend **€22** at the store to fill up her flower bed.",22.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Understand the problem**:  
   Mei has a flower bed that is 143 feet long. Each plant takes up 3 feet of space, and she needs to leave 13 feet between every plant (including the plant's width). Mei already owns 8 flowers, but she may need to buy more. Each plant costs €9, and if she buys more than 2 plants, she gets a €5 discount on the total purchase.

2. **Calculate the total number of plants needed**:  
   Each plant and the space around it take up 13 feet. To find how many plants fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:  
   \[
   \text{Number of plants needed} = \frac{\text{Length of flower bed}}{\text{Space per plant}} = \frac{143}{13}.
   \]  
   Performing the division:  
   \[
   143 \div 13 = 11 \text{ (remainder 0)}.
   \]  
   So, Mei needs **11 plants** to fill the flower bed.

3. **Determine how many plants Mei needs to buy**:  
   Mei already owns 8 flowers. To find how many more she needs to buy:  
   \[
   \text{Plants to buy} = \text{Total plants needed} - \text{Plants Mei already owns} = 11 - 8 = 3.
   \]  
   Mei needs to buy **3 more plants**.

4. **Calculate the cost of the plants**:  
   Each plant costs €9. If Mei buys 3 plants, the total cost before any discount is:  
   \[
   \text{Cost before discount} = 3 \times 9 = 27 \, \text{€}.
   \]  
   Since Mei is buying more than 2 plants, she gets a €5 discount. The final cost is:  
   \[
   \text{Final cost} = \text{Cost before discount} - \text{Discount} = 27 - 5 = 22 \, \text{€}.
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:  
   Mei will spend **€22** at the store to fill up her flower bed.

How long will it take her to peel and saute 60 clams if it takes 19 minutes to wash all the clams? Note that Yara can't work in parallel.,53.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it will take Yara to wash, peel, and sauté 60 clams. Since Yara cannot work in parallel, we will add up the time for each task sequentially.

---

### Step 1: Time to wash the clams
We are told that it takes Yara **19 minutes** to wash all the clams. This is a fixed time, so:

\[
\text{Time to wash clams} = 19 \, \text{minutes}.
\]

---

### Step 2: Time to peel the clams
Yara can peel **6 clams per minute**. To find the time it takes to peel 60 clams, we divide the total number of clams by her peeling rate:

\[
\text{Time to peel clams} = \frac{60 \, \text{clams}}{6 \, \text{clams/minute}} = 10 \, \text{minutes}.
\]

---

### Step 3: Time to sauté the clams
Yara can sauté **20 clams in 8 minutes**. To find the time it takes to sauté 60 clams, we first calculate her sautéing rate:

\[
\text{Sautéing rate} = \frac{20 \, \text{clams}}{8 \, \text{minutes}} = 2.5 \, \text{clams/minute}.
\]

Now, we divide the total number of clams by her sautéing rate:

\[
\text{Time to sauté clams} = \frac{60 \, \text{clams}}{2.5 \, \text{clams/minute}} = 24 \, \text{minutes}.
\]

---

### Step 4: Total time
Since Yara cannot work in parallel, we add up the times for washing, peeling, and sautéing:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time to wash} + \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to sauté}.
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Total time} = 19 \, \text{minutes} + 10 \, \text{minutes} + 24 \, \text{minutes} = 53 \, \text{minutes}.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
It will take Yara **53 minutes** to wash, peel, and sauté 60 clams.",60.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Yara needs to perform three tasks: **peeling**, **sautéing**, and **washing** the clams. Let's calculate the time required for each task.

1. **Peeling the clams**:
   - Yara can peel 6 clams in 1 minute.
   - To peel 60 clams, the time required is:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel} = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ minutes}.
     \]

2. **Sautéing the clams**:
   - Yara can sauté 20 clams in 8 minutes.
   - To sauté 60 clams, the time required is:
     \[
     \text{Time to sauté} = \frac{60}{20} \times 8 = 24 \text{ minutes}.
     \]

3. **Washing the clams**:
   - It is given that it takes Yara 19 minutes to wash all the clams.

4. **Total time**:
   - Since Yara cannot work in parallel, we add the times for all three tasks:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to sauté} + \text{Time to wash}.
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 10 + 24 + 19 = 53 \text{ minutes}.

Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet. How much older is Liam's uncle than Liam?,22.0,"We are tasked with finding how much older Liam's uncle is than Liam. Let's break this problem into steps.

---

### Step 1: Define the variables
- Let \( x \) represent the age difference between Liam's uncle and Liam (i.e., how much older Liam's uncle is than Liam).
- Liam's uncle first saw Comet Halley when he was 31 years old.
- Comet Halley orbits the Sun every 53 years.
- Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was **twice the age** his uncle was when his uncle first saw the comet.

---

### Step 2: Determine Liam's age when he saw the comet for the second time
Liam's uncle first saw the comet at age 31. Since Comet Halley orbits every 53 years, the comet would appear again 53 years later. Therefore:
- Liam's uncle saw the comet for the second time at age \( 31 + 53 = 84 \).

Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was **twice the age** his uncle was when his uncle first saw the comet. Since Liam's uncle was 31 years old when he first saw the comet, Liam's age at this time is:
\[
2 \times 31 = 62 \, \text{years old}.
\]

Thus, Liam was 62 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

---

### Step 3: Determine the age difference between Liam and his uncle
When Liam saw the comet for the second time, he was 62 years old, and his uncle was 84 years old. The age difference between them is:
\[
84 - 62 = 22.
\]

Thus, Liam's uncle is **22 years older** than Liam.

---

### Final Answer:
Liam's uncle is **22 years older** than Liam.",22.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Comet Halley orbits the Sun every 53 years. Liam's uncle saw the comet when he was 31 years old.  
   This means the comet appeared when Liam's uncle was 31 years old.

2. Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet.  
   Liam's uncle was 31 years old when he first saw the comet. Two times this age is \( 31 \times 2 = 62 \).  
   So, Liam was 62 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

3. Since the comet appears every 53 years, the second time Liam saw the comet was 53 years after the first time.  
   This means Liam saw the comet for the first time when he was \( 62 - 53 = 9 \) years old.

4. When Liam saw the comet for the first time, his uncle was 31 years old.  
   So, the age difference between Liam and his uncle is \( 31 - 9 = 22 \).

### Step 3: Bananas picked on Wednesday
On Wednesday, Ali picks **quintuple** (5 times) the number of bananas he picked on Monday.  
\[
5 \times 114 = 570
\]  
So, Ali picks **570 bananas** on Wednesday.

---

### Step 4: Total bananas picked in the first 3 days
Now, we calculate the total number of bananas Ali picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:

The total number of toys hidden is 100.

The Williams twins each found 26 toys. Since there are two twins, the total number of toys they found is:
26 + 26 = 52.

So, the number of toys remaining after the twins found theirs is:
100 - 52 = 48.

Out of these remaining 48 toys, 16 were not found by anyone. This means the number of toys found by their friends is:
48 - 16 = 32.

Now, we need to find what percentage of the initially hidden toys (100) were found by their friends. The percentage is calculated as:
(32 / 100) * 100 = 32%.

He can mine twice as much with one bronze pickaxe and 80% more with a diamond pickaxe than with one bronze pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 11 miners mine in a month with 28 days if they all use bronze pickaxe in the first half, and then switch to diamond pickaxes in the second half of the month?",4312.0,"To solve this problem, we will calculate the total amount of ore mined step by step.

---

### Step 1: Mining rate with different tools
- **Basic shovel**: 5 pounds of ore per day.
- **Bronze pickaxe**: Twice as much as with a basic shovel:
  \[
  2 \times 5 = 10 \, \text{pounds per day}.
  \]
- **Diamond pickaxe**: 80% more than with a bronze pickaxe:
  \[
  10 + (0.8 \times 10) = 10 + 8 = 18 \, \text{pounds per day}.
  \]

---

### Step 2: Mining schedule
- The month has 28 days.
- The miners use **bronze pickaxes** for the first half of the month (14 days) and **diamond pickaxes** for the second half of the month (14 days).

---

### Step 3: Mining per miner
- **First 14 days (bronze pickaxe)**:
  Each miner mines:
  \[
  10 \, \text{pounds/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 140 \, \text{pounds}.
  \]
- **Second 14 days (diamond pickaxe)**:
  Each miner mines:
  \[
  18 \, \text{pounds/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 252 \, \text{pounds}.
  \]
- Total mining per miner for the month:
  \[
  140 + 252 = 392 \, \text{pounds}.
  \]

---

### Step 4: Mining for 11 miners
If there are 11 miners, the total amount of ore mined in the month is:
\[
392 \, \text{pounds/miner} \times 11 \, \text{miners} = 4312 \, \text{pounds}.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The 11 miners can mine **4,312 pounds of ore** in the 28-day month.",28.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Understand the problem**:  
   - One miner can mine 5 pounds of ore per day with a basic shovel.  
   - With a bronze pickaxe, the miner can mine **twice as much** as with a basic shovel.  
     So, with a bronze pickaxe, a miner can mine \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) pounds of ore per day.  
   - With a diamond pickaxe, the miner can mine **80% more** than with a bronze pickaxe.  
     So, with a diamond pickaxe, a miner can mine \( 10 + (10 \times 0.8) = 10 + 8 = 18 \) pounds of ore per day.  

2. **Determine the mining schedule**:  
   - The month has 28 days.  
   - The miners use bronze pickaxes for the **first half** of the month (14 days).  
   - The miners use diamond pickaxes for the **second half** of the month (14 days).  

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by one miner**:  
   - In the first 14 days (using bronze pickaxes), one miner mines:  
     \( 10 \times 14 = 140 \) pounds of ore.  
   - In the next 14 days (using diamond pickaxes), one miner mines:  
     \( 18 \times 14 = 252 \) pounds of ore.  
   - Total ore mined by one miner in 28 days:  
     \( 140 + 252 = 392 \) pounds of ore.  

4. **Calculate the total ore mined by 11 miners**:  
   - If one miner mines 392 pounds of ore in 28 days, then 11 miners mine:  
     \( 392 \times 11 = 4312 \) pounds of ore.

Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Total seating capacity
The Sports Arena has a total seating capacity of **9400 people**.

### Step 2: Subtract reserved seats
We need to subtract the seats reserved for graduates, faculty, and event staff:
- **900 seats** for the graduates
- **300 seats** for the faculty
- **100 seats** for the event staff

The total reserved seats are:
\[
900 + 300 + 100 = 1300

How many emails does Sophia respond to in a 5-day work week?",260.0,"Let's break this problem into steps to find the solution.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the number of emails that don't require a response.
Sophia receives 150 emails a day, and 16% of them don't require a response. To find the number of emails that don't require a response:

\[
16\% \text{ of } 150 = 0.16 \times 150 = 24
\]

So, **24 emails per day don't require a response**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the number of emails that require a response.
The total number of emails Sophia receives per day is 150. Subtract the emails that don't require a response:

\[
150 - 24 = 126
\]

So, **126 emails per day require a response**.

---

### Step 3: Determine how many emails Sophia can respond to.
Sophia can only respond to **11 less than half** of the emails that require a response. First, calculate half of the emails that require a response:

\[
\frac{126}{2} = 63

### Final Answer:
Sophia responds to **260 emails** in a 5-day work week.",5.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

Sophia receives 150 emails a day.  
16% of those emails don't require any response.

How many puzzle pieces did Uma place during that hour?",127.0,"To determine how many puzzle pieces Uma placed during the hour, we will calculate the number of pieces she completed for each puzzle and then add them together.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces Uma completed for the first puzzle.
The first puzzle has **420 pieces**, and Uma completed **one-fifth** of it.

\[
\text{Pieces completed from the first puzzle} = \frac{1}{5} \times 420

They agree to split it with Tara getting 190 yards more than Ananya, and Umar getting 30 yards more than Tara. How much is left over for Ananya?",150.0,"We are tasked with determining how much fence Ananya gets after splitting the total of 860 yards among Ananya, Tara, and Umar, based on the given conditions. Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define variables
Let:
- \( A \) = the amount of fence Ananya gets (in yards),
- \( T \) = the amount of fence Tara gets (in yards),
- \( U \) = the amount of fence Umar gets (in yards).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( T = A + 190 \) (Tara gets 190 yards more than Ananya),
2. \( U = T + 30 = A + 190 + 30 = A + 220 \) (Umar gets 30 yards more than Tara),
3. The total amount of fence is 860 yards: \( A + T + U = 860 \).

---

### Step 2: Substitute \( T \) and \( U \) in terms of \( A \)
Using the relationships \( T = A + 190 \) and \( U = A + 220 \), substitute these into the total equation \( A + T + U = 860 \):
\[
A + (A + 190) + (A + 220) = 860
\]

---

### Step 3: Simplify the equation
Combine like terms:
\[
A + A + 190 + A + 220 = 860
\]
\[
3A + 410 = 860
\]

---

### Step 4: Solve for \( A \)
Subtract 410 from both sides:
\[
3A = 450
\]
Divide by 3:
\[
A = 150
\]

So, Ananya gets **150 yards** of fence.

---

### Step 5: Verify the solution
Now that we know \( A = 150 \), calculate \( T \) and \( U \):
- \( T = A + 190 = 150 + 190 = 340 \),
- \( U = A + 220 = 150 + 220 = 370 \).

Check the total:
\[
A + T + U = 150 + 340 + 370 = 860
\]
The total matches, so the solution is correct.

---

### Final Answer:
Ananya gets **150 yards** of fence.",150.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The total length of the fence is 860 yards.  
We are told that:  
- Tara gets 190 yards more than Ananya.  
- Umar gets 30 yards more than Tara.  

Let the length of the fence Ananya gets be \( x \).  
Then, the length of the fence Tara gets is \( x + 190 \).  
The length of the fence Umar gets is \( (x + 190) + 30 = x + 220 \).  

The total length of the fence is the sum of the portions each person gets:  
\[
x + (x + 190) + (x + 220) = 860
\]

Now, simplify the equation:  
\[
x + x + 190 + x + 220 = 860
\]  
\[
3x + 410 = 860
\]

Subtract 410 from both sides:  
\[
3x = 450

Divide both sides by 3:  
\[
x = 150

Each class is 30 minutes long, but he spends 15 minutes before each class to review the study materials and prepare. He goes to class for 4 days a week. He then spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?",33.0,"Let's break this problem into smaller steps to calculate how many hours Santiago spends learning each week.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total time Santiago spends in regular classes
Santiago has 6 periods in a day, and each class is 30 minutes long. Therefore, the total time he spends in regular classes per day is:

\[
6 \times 30 = 180 \, \text{minutes per day.}
\]

Since he goes to class for 4 days a week, the total time spent in regular classes per week is:

\[
180 \times 4 = 720 \, \text{minutes per week.}
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total time Santiago spends in extra classes
Santiago takes 3 extra classes per day, and each class is 30 minutes long. The total time spent in extra classes per day is:

\[
3 \times 30 = 90 \, \text{minutes per day.}
\]

Since he takes these extra classes for 4 days a week, the total time spent in extra classes per week is:

\[
90 \times 4 = 360 \, \text{minutes per week.}
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the preparation time for extra classes
Santiago spends 15 minutes preparing for each extra class. Since he takes 3 extra classes per day, the total preparation time per day is:

\[
3 \times 15 = 45 \, \text{minutes per day.}
\]

For 4 days a week, the total preparation time for extra classes is:

\[
45 \times 4 = 180 \, \text{minutes per week.}
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the total time spent on weekdays
Now, we add up all the time Santiago spends learning during the weekdays:

\[
\text{Total weekday time} = \text{Regular classes} + \text{Extra classes} + \text{Preparation time}
\]

\[
\text{Total weekday time} = 720 + 360 + 180 = 1,260 \, \text{minutes per week.}
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday
Santiago spends one-ninth of his total weekly minutes on Saturday and one-ninth on Sunday. First, calculate the total weekly minutes spent learning:

\[
\text{Total weekly minutes} = 1,260 \, \text{(weekday time)}.
\]

The time spent on Saturday is:

\[
\frac{1,260}{9} = 140 \, \text{minutes.}
\]

The time spent on Sunday is also:

\[
\frac{1,260}{9} = 140 \, \text{minutes.}
\]

The total time spent on Saturday and Sunday is:

\[
140 + 140 = 280 \, \text{minutes.}
\]

---

### Step 6: Calculate the total weekly learning time
Now, add the weekday learning time and the weekend learning time:

\[
\text{Total weekly learning time} = 1,260 + 280 = 1,540 \, \text{minutes.}
\]

---

### Step 7: Convert minutes to hours
To convert minutes to hours, divide by 60:

\[
\text{Total weekly learning time in hours} = \frac{1,540}{60} = 25.67 \, \text{hours.}
\]

---

### Final Answer:

1. **Calculate the total number of classes Santiago has each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods in a day.
   - Santiago takes 3 extra classes.
   - So, the total number of classes Santiago has each day is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \).

2. **Calculate the total time spent in classes each day:**
   - Each class is 30 minutes long.
   - Santiago has 9 classes each day.
   - So, the total time spent in classes each day is \( 9 \times 30 = 270 \) minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time spent preparing for classes each day:**
   - Santiago spends 15 minutes preparing before each class.
   - He has 9 classes each day.
   - So, the total time spent preparing each day is \( 9 \times 15 = 135 \) minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time spent on learning each day:**
   - The total time spent on learning each day is the sum of the time spent in classes and the time spent preparing.
   - So, the total time spent on learning each day is \( 270 + 135 = 405 \) minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time spent on learning during the weekdays:**
   - Santiago goes to class for 4 days a week.
   - Each day, he spends 405 minutes on learning.
   - So, the total time spent on learning during the weekdays is \( 405 \times 4 = 1620 \) minutes.

6. **Calculate the time spent on extra learning during the weekend:**
   - Santiago spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes on Saturday and one-ninth on Sunday.
   - His total weekly minutes are 1620.
   - One-ninth of his weekly minutes is \( 1620 \div 9 = 180 \) minutes.
   - So, he spends 180 minutes on Saturday and 180 minutes on Sunday.
   - The total time spent on extra learning during the weekend is \( 180 + 180 = 360 \) minutes.

7. **Calculate the total time spent on learning in a week:**
   - The total time spent on learning in a week is the sum of the time spent during the weekdays and the time spent during the weekend.
   - So, the total time spent on learning in a week is \( 1620 + 360 = 1980 \) minutes.

8. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - So, the total time spent on learning in a week in hours is \( 1980 \div 60 = 33 \) hours.

It takes **2 minutes longer** to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.",2.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The biggest waterslide is 300 yards long, and people slide down at 50 yards per minute.  
To find the time it takes to ride the biggest slide, we divide the length of the slide by the speed:  
300 ÷ 50 = 6 minutes.  

The second biggest waterslide is 280 yards long, and people slide down at 70 yards per minute.  
To find the time it takes to ride the second slide, we divide the length of the slide by the speed:  
280 ÷ 70 = 4 minutes.  

Now, we find how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide:  
6 - 4 = 2 minutes.

The supermarket has a promotion that gives a 20% discount on all purchases. How much will the supermarket have received after all the balls are sold?",220.0,"To calculate how much the supermarket will receive after selling all the balls, we need to follow these steps:

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of each type of ball before the discount.

1. **Blue balls:**
   - There are 9 blue balls, and each costs ₣12.
   - Total cost for blue balls = \( 9 \times 12 = 108 \).

2. **Purple balls:**
   - There are 11 purple balls, and each costs ₣9.
   - Total cost for purple balls = \( 11 \times 9 = 99 \).

3. **Pink balls:**
   - There are 17 pink balls, and each costs ₣4.
   - Total cost for pink balls = \( 17 \times 4 = 68 \).

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of all the balls before the discount.

- Total cost = Cost of blue balls + Cost of purple balls + Cost of pink balls:
  \[
  108 + 99 + 68 = 275
  \]

---

### Step 3: Apply the 20% discount.

- A 20% discount means the supermarket will receive 80% of the total cost.
- Discounted total = \( 275 \times 0.8 \):
  \[
  275 \times 0.8 = 220
  \]

---

### Final Answer:
The supermarket will receive **₣220** after all the balls are sold.",220.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, calculate the total cost of the blue balls:
   - There are 9 blue balls, and each costs ₣12.
   - The total cost of the blue balls is 9 * 12 = ₣108.

2. Next, calculate the total cost of the purple balls:
   - There are 11 purple balls, and each costs ₣9.
   - The total cost of the purple balls is 11 * 9 = ₣99.

3. Then, calculate the total cost of the pink balls:
   - There are 17 pink balls, and each costs ₣4.
   - The total cost of the pink balls is 17 * 4 = ₣68.

4. Add up the total cost of all the balls before the discount:
   - The total cost is ₣108 + ₣99 + ₣68 = ₣275.

5. Apply the 20% discount:
   - A 20% discount means the supermarket will receive 80% of the total cost.
   - 80% of ₣275 is (80/100) * 275 = 0.8 * 275 = ₣220.

p1,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Olivia walks 20 kilometers every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 kilometers of walking on the beach and 10 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?",75.0,"We are tasked with determining how long it takes Olivia to complete her 20-kilometer walk, given her walking speeds and the time spent on the beach. Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define Olivia's walking speeds before the injury
- Let Olivia's walking speed on the beach **before the injury** be \( x \) kilometers per minute.
- On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at **four times the speed** of her beach speed, so her speed on the sidewalk before the injury is \( 4x \) kilometers per minute.

---

### Step 2: Adjust for the injury
Due to her injury, Olivia's speed is reduced by half:
- Her walking speed on the beach **after the injury** is \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilometers per minute.
- Her walking speed on the sidewalk **after the injury** is \( \frac{4x}{2} = 2x \) kilometers per minute.

---

### Step 3: Use the given time spent on the beach
We are told that Olivia spends **60 minutes walking on the beach**. Using the formula for distance (\( \text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \)), we can calculate her speed on the beach:
\[
\text{Distance on the beach} = \text{Speed on the beach} \times \text{Time on the beach}.
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
10 = \frac{x}{2} \times 60.
\]
Solve for \( x \):
\[
10 = 30x \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
Thus, Olivia's walking speed on the beach **before the injury** is \( x = \frac{1}{3} \) kilometers per minute, and her walking speed **after the injury** is:
\[
\frac{x}{2} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ kilometers per minute}.
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate Olivia's walking speed on the sidewalk
Her walking speed on the sidewalk **after the injury** is:
\[
2x = 2 \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ kilometers per minute}.
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk
The total distance Olivia walks on the sidewalk is 10 kilometers. Using the formula for time (\( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \)), the time she spends on the sidewalk is:
\[
\text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on the sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on the sidewalk}} = \frac{10}{\frac{2}{3}}.
\]
Simplify:
\[
\text{Time on the sidewalk} = 10 \times \frac{3}{2} = 15 \times 3 = 30 minutes.
\",30.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Olivia walks 20 kilometers every day, which includes 10 kilometers on the beach and 10 kilometers on the sidewalk.

2. On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at **four times the speed** she does on the beach. Let her original speed on the beach be \( x \) kilometers per minute. Then her original speed on the sidewalk is \( 4x \) kilometers per minute.

3. Due to her injury, her speed has decreased by half. So, her new speed on the beach is \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilometers per minute, and her new speed on the sidewalk is \( \frac{4x}{2} = 2x \) kilometers per minute.

4. We are told that Olivia spends **60 minutes walking on the beach**. Using the formula for time, \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \), we can calculate her speed on the beach:
   \[
   \text{Time on the beach} = \frac{\text{Distance on the beach}}{\text{Speed on the beach}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   60 = \frac{10}{\frac{x}{2}}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   60 = \frac{10 \cdot 2}{x}
   \]
   \[
   60 = \frac{20}{x}
   \]
   Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{20}{60} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   So, Olivia's original speed on the beach was \( x = \frac{1}{3} \) kilometers per minute.

5. Now, her new speed on the beach is \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{1}{6} \) kilometers per minute, and her new speed on the sidewalk is \( 2x = \frac{2}{3} \) kilometers per minute.

6. Next, we calculate the time Olivia spends walking on the sidewalk. Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \):
   \[
   \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on the sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on the sidewalk}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{10}{\frac{2}{3}}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 10 \cdot \frac{3}{2} = 15 \cdot 3 = 30 \text{ minutes.}
   \]

7. Finally, we calculate the total time for Olivia's walk:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time on the beach} + \text{Time on the sidewalk}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ minutes.}

Now, look at this question:
Question: Olivia walks 20 kilometers every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 kilometers of walking on the beach and 10 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?
Your initial answer was: Let's think step by step.

1. Olivia walks 20 kilometers every day, which includes 10 kilometers on the beach and 10 kilometers on the sidewalk.

2. On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at **four times the speed** she does on the beach. Let her original speed on the beach be \( x \) kilometers per minute. Then her original speed on the sidewalk is \( 4x \) kilometers per minute.

3. Due to her injury, her speed has decreased by half. So, her new speed on the beach is \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilometers per minute, and her new speed on the sidewalk is \( \frac{4x}{2} = 2x \) kilometers per minute.

4. We are told that Olivia spends **60 minutes walking on the beach**. Using the formula for time, \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \), we can calculate her speed on the beach:
   \[
   \text{Time on the beach} = \frac{\text{Distance on the beach}}{\text{Speed on the beach}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   60 = \frac{10}{\frac{x}{2}}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   60 = \frac{10 \cdot 2}{x}
   \]
   \[
   60 = \frac{20}{x}
   \]
   Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{20}{60} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   So, Olivia's original speed on the beach was \( x = \frac{1}{3} \) kilometers per minute.

5. Now, her new speed on the beach is \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{1}{6} \) kilometers per minute, and her new speed on the sidewalk is \( 2x = \frac{2}{3} \) kilometers per minute.

6. Next, we calculate the time Olivia spends walking on the sidewalk. Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \):
   \[
   \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on the sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on the sidewalk}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{10}{\frac{2}{3}}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 10 \cdot \frac{3}{2} = 15 \cdot 3 = 30 \text{ minutes.}
   \]

7. Finally, we calculate the total time for Olivia's walk:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time on the beach} + \text{Time on the sidewalk}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ minutes.}
   \]

The answer is **90 minutes**.

     - Her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2x = \frac{2}{3} \) kilometers per minute.

5. **Calculate the Time on the Sidewalk:**
   - Time on the sidewalk = \( \frac{\text{Distance on the sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on the sidewalk}} \).
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{10}{\frac{2}{3}}
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[

     \]

6. **Calculate the Total Time:**
   - Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk.
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 60 + 15 = 75 \text{ minutes.}
     \]

7. **Final Answer:**
   The total time it takes for Olivia to complete the 20-kilometer walk is **75 minutes**.

For guidance, I will provide you with a single example problem of similar complexity and reflection (below).  

[Example Input]  
Question: A cyclist travels a total of 30 kilometers, split between two segments. On the first segment, the cyclist rides uphill at a speed of 10 km/h. On the second segment, the cyclist rides downhill at a speed of 20 km/h. The total time spent cycling is 2.5 hours. How far does the cyclist travel uphill?  

Wrong answer: The cyclist spends 1.25 hours on each segment because the total time is 2.5 hours. Therefore, the distance traveled uphill is \( 10 \, \text{km/h} \times 1.25 \, \text{hours} = 12.5 \, \text{km} \).  

---  

[Example Output]  

**Explanation:**  
I incorrectly assumed that the time spent on each segment was equal, which is not true because the cyclist travels at different speeds on each segment. This led to an incorrect calculation of the distance traveled uphill.  

**Error Keywords:**  
- Misinterpreted rate relationships  
- Incorrect assumption about time distribution  
- Calculation error  

**Solution:**  
1. Let the time spent traveling uphill be \( t_1 \) hours and the time spent traveling downhill be \( t_2 \) hours.  
2. Use the relationship \( t_1 + t_2 = 2.5 \) hours.  
3. Use the distance formula \( \text{distance} = \text{rate} \times \text{time} \) for each segment:  
   - Distance uphill: \( 10 \, \text{km/h} \times t_1 \)  
   - Distance downhill: \( 20 \, \text{km/h} \times t_2 \)  
4. The total distance is 30 km, so \( 10t_1 + 20t_2 = 30 \).  
5. Solve the system of equations:  
   - \( t_1 + t_2 = 2.5 \)  
   - \( 10t_1 + 20t_2 = 30 \)  
   Substituting \( t_2 = 2.5 - t_1 \) into the second equation:  
   \( 10t_1 + 20(2.5 - t_1) = 30 \)  
   \( 10t_1 + 50 - 20t_1 = 30 \)  
   \( -10t_1 = -20 \)  
   \( t_1 = 2 \, \text{hours} \).  
6. The distance traveled uphill is \( 10 \, \text{km/h} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{km} \).  

**Instructions:**  
1. Identify the variables for time, rate, and distance for each segment of the journey.  
2. Write equations for the total time and total distance.  
3. Use the relationship \( \text{distance} = \text{rate} \times \text{time} \) for each segment.  
4. Solve the system of equations carefully, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.  
5. Double-check assumptions about time, rate, and distance relationships.  

**Advice:**  
- Always verify whether time is distributed equally across segments.  
- Use the relationship \( \text{distance} = \text{rate} \

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Reflection on the Incorrect Answer

**Explanation of the Error:**  
The incorrect answer of 90 minutes likely resulted from a misunderstanding of the relationship between Olivia's walking speeds on the beach and the sidewalk, as well as the impact of her injury on those speeds. Specifically, I may have failed to properly account for the fact that her speed on the sidewalk is four times her speed on the beach (before the injury) and that both speeds are halved due to her injury. Additionally, I may have made an error in interpreting the time spent on the beach (60 minutes) and how it relates to the total time for the entire walk.

**Error Keywords:**  
- Misinterpreted rate relationships  
- Incorrect algebra setup  
- Miscalculation of total time  

---

### Correct Solution (Step-by-Step)

#### Step 1: Define variables and relationships
Let Olivia's original speed on the beach (before the injury) be \( r \) km/min.  
- Her original speed on the sidewalk is \( 4r \) km/min (four times her beach speed).  
- Due to her injury, her speed on the beach is halved to \( \frac{r}{2} \) km/min.  
- Her speed on the sidewalk is also halved to \( \frac{4r}{2} = 2r \) km/min.  

#### Step 2: Use the given information
- Olivia walks 10 kilometers on the beach at a speed of \( \frac{r}{2} \).  
- She spends 60 minutes walking on the beach.  
Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{rate}} \), we can calculate her speed on the beach:  
\[
\text{Time on beach} = \frac{\text{Distance on beach}}{\text{Speed on beach}} \implies 60 = \frac{10}{\frac{r}{2}}.
\]
Simplify:  
\[
60 = \frac{10 \cdot 2}{r} \implies 60 = \frac{20}{r}.
\]
Solve for \( r \):  
\[
r = \frac{20}{60} = \frac{1}{3} \, \text{km/min}.
\]

Thus, Olivia's original speed on the beach was \( r = \frac{1}{3} \, \text{km/min} \), and her injured speed on the beach is \( \frac{r}{2} = \frac{1}{6} \, \text{km/min} \).  

#### Step 3: Calculate her speed on the sidewalk
Her injured speed on the sidewalk is \( 2r = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \, \text{km/min}. \)

#### Step 4: Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk
Olivia walks 10 kilometers on the sidewalk at a speed of \( \frac{2}{3} \, \text{km/min} \). Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{rate}} \):  
\[
\text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{10}{\frac{2}{3}} = 10 \cdot \frac{3}{2} = 15 \cdot 3 = 15","--- Adapted Self-Reflection Prompt ---

Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future, such as how to systematically approach rate, time, and distance problems with multiple conditions.  

For guidance, I will provide you with a single example problem of similar complexity and reflection (below).  

[Example Input]  
Question: A cyclist travels a total of 30 kilometers, split between two segments. On the first segment, the cyclist rides uphill at a speed of 10 km/h. On the second segment, the cyclist rides downhill at a speed of 20 km/h. The total time spent cycling is 2.5 hours. How far does the cyclist travel uphill?  

Wrong answer: The cyclist spends 1.25 hours on each segment because the total time is 2.5 hours. Therefore, the distance traveled uphill is \( 10 \, \text{km/h} \times 1.25 \, \text{hours} = 12.5 \, \text{km} \).  

---  

[Example Output]  

**Explanation:**  
I incorrectly assumed that the time spent on each segment was equal, which is not true because the cyclist travels at different speeds on each segment. This led to an incorrect calculation of the distance traveled uphill.  

**Error Keywords:**  
- Misinterpreted rate relationships  
- Incorrect assumption about time distribution  
- Calculation error  

**Solution:**  
1. Let the time spent traveling uphill be \( t_1 \) hours and the time spent traveling downhill be \( t_2 \) hours.  
2. Use the relationship \( t_1 + t_2 = 2.5 \) hours.  
3. Use the distance formula \( \text{distance} = \text{rate} \times \text{time} \) for each segment:  
   - Distance uphill: \( 10 \, \text{km/h} \times t_1 \)  
   - Distance downhill: \( 20 \, \text{km/h} \times t_2 \)  
4. The total distance is 30 km, so \( 10t_1 + 20t_2 = 30 \).  
5. Solve the system of equations:  
   - \( t_1 + t_2 = 2.5 \)  
   - \( 10t_1 + 20t_2 = 30 \)  
   Substituting \( t_2 = 2.5 - t_1 \) into the second equation:  
   \( 10t_1 + 20(2.5 - t_1) = 30 \)  
   \( 10t_1 + 50 - 20t_1 = 30 \)  
   \( -10t_1 = -20 \)  
   \( t_1 = 2 \, \text{hours} \).  
6. The distance traveled uphill is \( 10 \, \text{km/h} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{km} \).  

**Instructions:**  
1. Identify the variables for time, rate, and distance for each segment of the journey.  
2. Write equations for the total time and total distance.  
3. Use the relationship \( \text{distance} = \text{rate} \times \text{time} \) for each segment.  
4. Solve the system of equations carefully, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.  
5. Double-check assumptions about time, rate, and distance relationships.  

**Advice:**  
- Always verify whether time is distributed equally across segments.  
- Use the relationship \( \text{distance} = \text{rate} \

### Step 1: Understand the problem
- Arjun eats **3 pancakes per day** for the first **57 days**.
- After that, he eats **9 pancakes per day** for the remaining days in a 10-week period.
- We need to calculate the total number of pancakes he eats and convert that into dozens (1 dozen = 12 pancakes).

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of days in 10 weeks
- There are 7 days in a week.
- In 10 weeks, the total number of days is:
  \[
  10 \times 7 = 70 \text{ days.}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of days Arjun eats 9 pancakes
- Arjun eats 3 pancakes per day for the first 57 days.
- The remaining days in the 10-week period are:
  \[
  70 - 57 = 13 \text{ days.}
  \]
- So, Arjun eats 9 pancakes per day for the last 13 days.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of pancakes
#### Pancakes eaten in the first 57 days:
- Arjun eats 3 pancakes per day for 57 days:
  \[
  3 \times 57 = 171 \text{ pancakes.}
  \]

#### Pancakes eaten in the last 13 days:
- Arjun eats 9 pancakes per day for 13 days:
  \[
  9 \times 13 = 117 \text{ pancakes.}
  \]

#### Total pancakes:
- The total number of pancakes Arjun eats is:
  \[
  171 + 117 = 288 \text{ pancakes.}
  \]

### Step 5: Convert pancakes to dozens
- Since 1 dozen = 12 pancakes, the number of dozens is:
  \[
  \frac{288}{12} = 24 \text{ dozens.}
  \]

### Final Answer:
Arjun will need **24 dozens of pancakes** for 10 weeks.",10.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, we need to calculate the total number of days in 10 weeks.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, 10 weeks = 10 * 7 = 70 days.

2. Arjun eats 3 pancakes a day for the first 57 days.
   - The total number of pancakes he eats in these 57 days is 3 * 57 = 171 pancakes.

3. After 57 days, there are 70 - 57 = 13 days remaining.
   - During these 13 days, Arjun eats 9 pancakes a day.
   - The total number of pancakes he eats in these 13 days is 9 * 13 = 117 pancakes.

4. The total number of pancakes Arjun eats in 70 days is:
   - 171 (from the first 57 days) + 117 (from the last 13 days) = 288 pancakes.

5. Now, we need to calculate how many dozens of pancakes Arjun will need.
   - A dozen is 12 pancakes.
   - The number of dozens in 288 pancakes is 288 / 12 = 24 dozens.

How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?",12.0,"To solve this problem, we will calculate step by step how many eggs each person finds and then determine how many eggs are still hidden.

---

### Step 1: Total eggs hidden
Esteban hid **11 dozen eggs**. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs:
\[
11 \times 12 = 132 \text{ eggs}
\]
So, there are **132 eggs** hidden in total.

---

### Step 2: Eggs found by James
James finds **4 eggs**.

---

### Step 3: Eggs found by Tara
Tara finds **five times as many eggs as James**:
\[
5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ eggs}
\]
So, Tara finds **20 eggs**.

---

### Step 4: Eggs found by Winnie
Winnie finds **4 less than Tara**:
\[
20 - 4 = 16 \text{ eggs}
\]
So, Winnie finds **16 eggs**.

---

### Step 5: Eggs found by Noah
Noah finds **half as many eggs as Winnie**:
\[
\frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ eggs}
\]
So, Noah finds **8 eggs**.

---

### Step 6: Eggs found by Oscar
Oscar finds **four dozen eggs more than Tara and James combined**. First, calculate how many eggs Tara and James found together:
\[
20 + 4 = 24 \text{ eggs}
\]
Now, calculate four dozen eggs:
\[
4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs}
\]
Add this to the total found by Tara and James:
\[
24 + 48 = 72 \text{ eggs}
\]
So, Oscar finds **72 eggs**.

---

### Step 7: Total eggs found
Now, add up the eggs found by everyone:
\[
4 \text{ (James)} + 20 \text{ (Tara)} + 16 \text{ (Winnie)} + 8 \text{ (Noah)} + 72 \text{ (Oscar)} = 120 \text{ eggs}
\]
So, a total of **120 eggs** have been found.

---

### Step 8: Eggs still hidden
Subtract the total eggs found from the total eggs hidden:
\[
132 - 120 = 12 \text{ eggs}

However, due to a recent injury, the maintenance worker has become slower and it will take them twice as long to clean a floor these days. If they work for 6 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?",60.0,"Let's break this problem into steps to calculate the percentage of the maintenance worker's day spent cleaning floors.

---

### Step 1: Determine how long it takes to clean one floor now.
The worker originally took **6 minutes per floor**, but due to the injury, it now takes **twice as long**.  
\[
\text{Time per floor} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \, \text{minutes per floor}.
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total time required to clean all 180 floors.
The worker needs to clean **180 floors**, and each floor takes **12 minutes**.  
\[
\text{Total time to clean all floors} = 180 \times 12 = 2160 \, \text{minutes}.

### Step 6: Calculate the percentage of the worker's day spent cleaning floors.
The worker needs **2160 minutes** to clean all the floors over **10 days**, so the average time spent cleaning per day is:  
\[
\text{Time spent cleaning per day} = \frac{2160}{10} = 216 \, \text{minutes per day}.
\]

The percentage of the day spent cleaning is:  
\[
\text{Percentage of day cleaning} = \left( \frac{216}{360} \right) \times 100 = 60\%.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The maintenance worker spends **60% of their day, on average, cleaning floors**.",60.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The maintenance worker has 180 floors to clean, and it originally took them 6 minutes per floor. However, due to the injury, it now takes them **twice as long**, which means it takes **6 × 2 = 12 minutes per floor**.

Next, let's calculate how much time it will take to clean all 180 floors:
- Each floor takes 12 minutes.
- For 180 floors, the total time required is **180 × 12 = 2160 minutes**.

The maintenance worker has 10 days to complete the task. So, the time they need to work per day is:
- Total time = 2160 minutes.
- Time per day = **2160 ÷ 10 = 216 minutes per day**.

Now, the maintenance worker works for 6 hours a day. Let's convert 6 hours into minutes:
- 1 hour = 60 minutes.
- 6 hours = **6 × 60 = 360 minutes**.

Next, we calculate the percentage of their day spent cleaning floors:
- Time spent cleaning per day = 216 minutes.
- Total time available per day = 360 minutes.
- Percentage of the day spent cleaning = **(216 ÷ 360) × 100 = 60%**.

p1,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Gabriel has a bag of beads with 78 inside. He tripped over a root while carrying it and dropped one-third of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 17. When he went back home, he inspected the beads further. Nine of them he picked up weren't beads, but actually beads, so he got rid of them. Seeing how upset Gabriel was, his father gave him a pouch of beads with 7 beads inside. How many beads did Gabriel end up with?",67.0,"Let's break this problem into steps to determine how many beads Gabriel ended up with.

---

### Step 1: Calculate how many beads Gabriel dropped.
Gabriel started with **78 beads**. He dropped **one-third** of them. To find how many beads he dropped:

\[
\text{Beads dropped} = \frac{1}{3} \times 78 = 26
\]

So, Gabriel dropped **26 beads**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate how many beads Gabriel still had after dropping some.
If Gabriel started with 78 beads and dropped 26, the number of beads he still had is:

\[
\text{Beads left} = 78 - 26 = 52
\]

So, Gabriel had **52 beads** after dropping some.

---

### Step 3: Account for the beads Gabriel found.
Gabriel searched for the beads he dropped and found **17 beads**. Adding these back to the beads he already had:

\[
\text{Beads after finding} = 52 + 17 = 69
\]

So, Gabriel now had **69 beads**.

---

### Step 4: Remove the 9 items that weren't beads.
Gabriel realized that **9 of the items he picked up weren't beads**. Subtract these from the total:

\[
\text{Beads after removing non-beads} = 69 - 9 = 60
\]

So, Gabriel now had **60 beads**.

---

### Step 5: Add the beads his father gave him.
Gabriel's father gave him a pouch containing **7 beads**. Adding these to the total:

\[
\text{Final total beads} = 60 + 7 = 67
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Gabriel ended up with **67 beads**.",67.0,1,"Gabriel starts with 78 beads in his bag.

1. He drops one-third of the beads.  
   One-third of 78 is:  
   \( 78 \div 3 = 26 \).  
   So, he drops 26 beads and is left with:  
   \( 78 - 26 = 52 \) beads.

2. He searches for the dropped beads and finds 17 of them.  
   Adding these back to his remaining beads:  
   \( 52 + 17 = 69 \) beads.

3. Upon inspection, Gabriel realizes that 9 of the beads he picked up aren't beads, so he gets rid of them.  
   Subtracting these 9 from his total:  
   \( 69 - 9 = 60 \) beads.

4. Gabriel's father gives him a pouch with 7 beads.  
   Adding these to his total:  
   \( 60 + 7 = 67 \) beads.

As the pot of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 90 pop in the first 22 seconds of cooking, then 3 times that amount in the next 22 seconds. The kernels increase to 4 times the initial popping rate in the next 22 seconds. In the final 22 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 22 seconds. After Alejandro takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. Alejandro gives 1/5 of the made popcorns to his brother Tariq. How many pieces of popcorn does Alejandro have to eat?",756.0,"Let's break this problem into steps and solve it systematically.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 22-second interval.

#### First 22 seconds:
We are told that **90 kernels** popped in the first 22 seconds.

#### Second 22 seconds:
In the next 22 seconds, **3 times** the amount of the first interval popped:
\[
3 \times 90 = 270 \text{ kernels.}
\]

#### Third 22 seconds:
In the third 22 seconds, the popping rate increased to **4 times** the initial popping rate:
\[
4 \times 90 = 360 \text{ kernels.}
\]

#### Fourth 22 seconds:
In the final 22 seconds, the popping slowed to **half the rate** of the previous interval:
\[
\frac{360}{2} = 180 \text{ kernels.}
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the number of kernels that popped after the pot was taken off the heat.

After the pot was removed from the heat, **a quarter** of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds also popped:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 180 = 45 \text{ kernels.}
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of popped kernels.

Add up all the kernels that popped during and after cooking:
\[
90 + 270 + 360 + 180 + 45 = 945 \text{ kernels.}
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the number of kernels Alejandro gives to Tariq.

Alejandro gives **1/5** of the total popped kernels to Tariq:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 945 = 189 \text{ kernels.}
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the number of kernels Alejandro has left to eat.

Subtract the number of kernels given to Tariq from the total:
\[
945 - 189 = 756 \text{ kernels.}
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Alejandro has **756 pieces of popcorn** to eat.",756.0,1,"Alejandro is popping popcorn, and we need to calculate how many pieces of popcorn he has left to eat after giving some to his brother. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of kernels that popped in the first 22 seconds.
We are told that **90 kernels** popped in the first 22 seconds.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of kernels that popped in the next 22 seconds.
In the next 22 seconds, the popping rate is **3 times** the initial rate. So:
\[
90 \times 3 = 270
\]
Thus, **270 kernels** popped in the second 22 seconds.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of kernels that popped in the third 22 seconds.
In the third 22 seconds, the popping rate is **4 times** the initial rate. So:
\[
90 \times 4 = 360
\]
Thus, **360 kernels** popped in the third 22 seconds.

### Step 4: Calculate the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds.
In the final 22 seconds, the popping rate slows down to **half** the rate of the previous 22 seconds. The rate in the third 22 seconds was 360, so:
\[
360 \div 2 = 180
\]
Thus, **180 kernels** popped in the final 22 seconds.

### Step 5: Calculate the number of kernels that popped from residual heat.
After the pot is taken off the heat, **a quarter** of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds also pop. So:
\[
180 \div 4 = 45
\]
Thus, **45 kernels** popped from residual heat.

### Step 6: Calculate the total number of popped kernels.
Now, we add up all the popped kernels:
\[
90 + 270 + 360 + 180 + 45 = 945
\]
So, a total of **945 kernels** popped.

### Step 7: Calculate how many kernels Alejandro gives to Tariq.
Alejandro gives **1/5** of the total popped kernels to his brother Tariq. So:
\[
945 \div 5 = 189
\]
Thus, Alejandro gives **189 kernels** to Tariq.

### Step 8: Calculate how many kernels Alejandro has left to eat.
To find how many kernels Alejandro has left, subtract the number he gave to Tariq from the total:
\[
945 - 189 = 756
\]
Thus, Alejandro has **756 kernels** left to eat.

If there are 40 cubes in the pyramid in total, what percentage of cubes are white?",40.0,"We are tasked with finding the percentage of white cubes in a pyramid made of green, black, and white cubes. Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the given information
- The pyramid contains **4 green cubes**.
- The number of black cubes is **five times as many as the green cubes**.
- The total number of cubes in the pyramid is **40**.
- The number of white cubes is **unknown**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the number of black cubes
The number of black cubes is **five times the number of green cubes**. Since there are 4 green cubes:

\[
\text{Black cubes} = 5 \times 4 = 20
\]

So, there are **20 black cubes**.

---

### Step 3: Write an equation for the total number of cubes
The total number of cubes in the pyramid is the sum of the green, black, and white cubes. Let \( x \) represent the number of white cubes. Then:

\[
\text{Green cubes} + \text{Black cubes} + \text{White cubes} = 40
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
4 + 20 + x = 40
\]

---

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
Simplify the equation:

\[
24 + x = 40
\]

Subtract 24 from both sides:

\[
x = 16
\]

So, there are **16 white cubes**.

---

### Step 5: Calculate the percentage of white cubes
The percentage of white cubes is given by:

\[
\text{Percentage of white cubes} = \left( \frac{\text{White cubes}}{\text{Total cubes}} \right) \times 100

2. Calculate the number of black cubes:
   The number of black cubes is five times the number of green cubes.
   So, the number of black cubes is 5 * 4 = 20.

3. Find the number of white cubes:
   The total number of cubes is 40. The sum of green and black cubes is:
   4 (green) + 20 (black) = 24.
   The remaining cubes are white. So, the number of white cubes is:
   40 - 24 = 16.

4. Calculate the percentage of cubes that are white:
   The total number of cubes is 40, and the number of white cubes is 16.

### Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the car and its contents.

1. **Weight of the car**:  
   The car weighs **1350 pounds**.

2. **Weight of the luggage**:  
   The luggage weighs **450 pounds**.

3. **Weight of the children**:  
   There are 4 children, each weighing **65 pounds**.  
   Total weight of the children:  
   \[

---

### Final Answer:  
Esteban needs **44 pounds of force** to push the car.",44.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The car itself weighs 1350 pounds.  
The luggage in the car weighs 450 pounds.  
Each of Esteban's 4 children weighs 65 pounds, so their total weight is:  
4 * 65 = 260 pounds.  
The car also has two spare tires, each weighing 70 pounds, so their total weight is:

### Step 1: Define the given information
- Oscar is **54 years old**.
- Oscar and Arash are **27 years apart** in age.
- Oscar and Ali are **18 years apart** in age.
- Oscar is **younger than Arash** but **older than Ali**.

---

### Step 2: Determine Arash's age
Since Oscar is **younger than Arash** and they are **27 years apart**, we calculate Arash's age as:
\[
\text{Arash's age} = \text{Oscar's age} + 27 = 54 + 27 = 81

### Step 1: Find the number of blueberry cupcakes.
The total number of cupcakes made is **6900**. The Smith family has made:
- **1126 peanut butter cupcakes**
- **1634 lemon cupcakes**

The number of blueberry cupcakes is the total number of cupcakes minus the sum of the peanut butter and lemon cupcakes:

\[
\text{Blueberry cupcakes} = \text{Total cupcakes} - (\text{Peanut butter cupcakes} + \text{Lemon cupcakes})
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Blueberry cupcakes} = 6900 - (1126 + 1634)
\]

First, calculate the sum of peanut butter and lemon cupcakes:

\[
1126 + 1634 = 2760

### Final Answer:
**60%** of the cupcakes are blueberry cupcakes.",60.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The Smith family has made a total of 6900 cupcakes.

They have 1126 peanut butter cupcakes and 1634 lemon cupcakes. To find the number of blueberry cupcakes, we subtract the number of peanut butter and lemon cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes:
\[
\text{Number of blueberry cupcakes} = 6900 - 1126 - 1634
\]
First, calculate \( 1126 + 1634 \):
\[
1126 + 1634 = 2760

Now subtract \( 2760 \) from \( 6900 \):
\[
6900 - 2760 = 4140
\]
So, there are 4140 blueberry cupcakes.

Next, we need to find what percentage of the total cupcakes are blueberry cupcakes. The formula for percentage is:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100
