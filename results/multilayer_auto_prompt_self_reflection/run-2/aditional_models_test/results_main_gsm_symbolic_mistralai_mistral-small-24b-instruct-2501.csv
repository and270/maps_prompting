First, let's find out how much water is in the original 20 liters of peach drink. Since the peach drink is 1/5 water, we can calculate the amount of water in it as follows:

Water in peach drink = (1/5) * 20 liters = 4 liters

Now, you spill 5 liters of the peach drink. Since the peach drink is 1/5 water, the amount of water spilled is:

Water spilled = (1/5) * 5 liters = 1 liter

So, the remaining peach drink has:

Remaining water in peach drink = 4 liters - 1 liter = 3 liters

Now, let's find out how much water is in the 16 liters of lemon drink. Since the lemon drink is 1/4 water, we can calculate the amount of water in it as follows:

Water in lemon drink = (1/4) * 16 liters = 4 liters

Now, we combine the remaining peach drink and the lemon drink. The total volume of the mixture is:

Total volume = (20 liters - 5 liters) + 16 liters = 15 liters + 16 liters = 31 liters

The total amount of water in the mixture is the sum of the water in the remaining peach drink and the water in the lemon drink:

If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 6 hours if she spends 2/4 of the time running and three-sixths of the time walking?",36.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Jasmine's skipping speed:**
   Jasmine can skip at 6 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Jasmine's running speed:**
   Since skipping is 3/5 as fast as running, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Running Speed} = \frac{\text{Skipping Speed}}{\frac{3}{5}} = \frac{6}{\frac{3}{5}} = 6 \times \frac{5}{3} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}

   Since Jasmine can run five times faster than she can walk, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Walking Speed} = \frac{\text{Running Speed}}{5} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ miles per hour}

   - Let \( W \) be her walking speed.
   - Therefore, \( R = 5W \).
   - Since \( R = 10 \) miles per hour:
     \[
     10 = 5W \implies W = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time spent on each activity:**
   - Total time = 6 hours.
   - Time spent running = \( \frac{2}{4} \) of 6 hours = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \) hours.
   - Time spent walking = \( \frac{3}{6} \) of 6 hours = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \) hours.
   - Time spent skipping = 6 hours - (3 hours running + 3 hours walking) = 0 hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled in each activity:**
   - Distance running = Running speed \( \times \) Time running = \( 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \) miles.
   - Distance walking = Walking speed \( \times \) Time walking = \( 2 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \) miles.
   - Distance skipping = Skipping speed \( \times \) Time skipping = \( 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0 \text{ hours} = 0 \) miles.

5. **Total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking + Distance skipping
   - Total distance = 30 miles + 6 miles + 0 miles = 36 miles.

The answer is 36 miles.",36.0,1,0.0,1.0,36.0,,,,,,,,

1. The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 53:24. This means for every 53 teaspoons of sugar, there are 24 cups of water.
2. The total parts in the ratio are 53 (sugar) + 24 (water) = 77 parts.
3. Emma used a total of 77 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined.
4. To find out how many of these are teaspoons of sugar, we calculate the proportion of the total that is sugar: (53/77) * 77 = 53.
5. Therefore, the number of teaspoons of sugar Emma used is 53.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,25.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then find the difference between them.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**

A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

So, the probability \( P(\text{greater than 3}) \) is:
\[ P(\text{greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for the first roll. For the second roll, since the die is rolled again, there are still 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

So, the probability \( P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) \) is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \left(\frac{3}{6}\right) \times \left(\frac{3}{6}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

3. **Difference in probabilities:**

Now, we find the difference between the two probabilities:
\[ \text{Difference} = P(\text{greater than 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

2. Next, we need to find out how many of these tennis balls are white. Since half of the tennis balls are white, we calculate:
   White tennis balls = (1/2) * Tennis balls

Now let's do the math:

1. Tennis balls = (1/3) * 540 = 180
2. White tennis balls = (1/2) * 180 = 90

So, there are 90 white tennis balls.",90.0,1,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Find the number of tennis balls:**
   The juggler has 540 balls in total.

   The increase in price per share is 60/100 * ₣75 = ₣45.
   So, the new price per share after the first year is ₣75 + ₣45 = ₣120.

3. **Value After First Year:**
   The total value of Keisha's shares after the first year is 17 * ₣120 = ₣2,040.

   The stock price decreases by 45%.
   The decrease in price per share is 45/100 * ₣120 = ₣54.

The roller coaster cost $11 a ride. How many friends can she invite?",1.0,"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Laser Tag Cost:**
   - Sofia wants to play one round of laser tag, which costs $6.

2. **Pinball Tokens:**
   - Sofia wants $6 worth of pinball tokens.

3. **Roller Coaster Rides:**
   - Sofia wants to ride the roller coaster eight times, which costs $11 per ride.
   - The total cost for roller coaster rides is \( 8 \times 11 = $88 \).

Now, let's add up the costs for Sofia:

- Laser Tag: $6
- Pinball Tokens: $6
- Roller Coaster: $88

Total cost for Sofia: \( 6 + 6 + 88 = $100 \)

Sofia's mom has a $200 budget. Subtracting Sofia's expenses from the total budget gives us:

\( 200 - 100 = $100 \)

Now, let's determine how many friends Sofia can invite with the remaining $100. Each friend will have the same expenses as Sofia:

- Laser Tag: $6
- Pinball Tokens: $6
- Roller Coaster: $88

Total cost per friend: \( 6 + 6 + 88 = $100 \)

**Error Keywords:**
- Miscalculation
- Arithmetic error
- Incorrect subtraction
- Incorrect addition
- Incorrect sequence of operations

### Solution:

1. **Calculate the initial number of plums:**
   - There are ten times as many plums as bananas.
   - Initial number of bananas = 38
   - Initial number of plums = 10 * 38 = 380 plums

2. **Calculate the new total number of bananas:**
   - Wei bought 46 more bananas.
   - New total number of bananas = 38 + 46 = 84 bananas

3. **Calculate the new total number of plums:**
   - Wei has 45 fewer plums than the number of bananas.
   - New total number of plums = 380 - 45 = 335 plums

4. **Add the total number of plums and bananas together:**
   - Combined total = 335 plums + 84 bananas = 419

1. **Calculate the amount of money Liam had left in change:**
   Liam had 8% of his money left in change. So, the amount of change he had is:
   \[
   \text{Change} = 1000 \times 0.08 = 80 \text{ cents}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount spent on popcorn and pretzels:**
   Liam spent 1000 cents initially and had 80 cents left, so the total amount spent is:
   \[
   \text{Total spent} = 1000 - 80 = 920 \text{ cents}

3. **Calculate the amount spent on popcorn:**
   Liam bought 4 bags of popcorn, each costing 25 cents. So, the total amount spent on popcorn is:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on popcorn} = 4 \times 25 = 100 \text{ cents}

4. **Calculate the amount spent on pretzels:**
   The total amount spent on pretzels is the total amount spent minus the amount spent on popcorn:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on pretzels} = 920 - 100 = 820 \text{ cents}

Thrice the cold water time = 3 * 16 = 48 minutes
Warm water time for 1 mile = 48 minutes + 6 minutes = 54 minutes

Now, let's calculate how long it takes Tariq to swim 8 miles on a cold day and on a warm day.

Cold day time for 8 miles = 16 minutes/mile * 8 miles = 128 minutes
Warm day time for 8 miles = 54 minutes/mile * 8 miles = 432 minutes

Finally, let's find out how much longer it takes Tariq to swim 8 miles on a warm day than on a cold day.

Difference in time = Warm day time for 8 miles - Cold day time for 8 miles

He also decided to buy himself a cookie for ₣2. How much did everything cost?,296.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Calculate the additional cost per kilogram for the more expensive brand:**
   The more expensive brand costs 40% more than the normal brand.
   Additional cost = 40% of ₣15
   = (40/100) * ₣15
   = 0.4 * ₣15

2. **Calculate the cost per kilogram of the more expensive brand:**
   Cost per kilogram of the more expensive brand = Normal cost + Additional cost

3. **Calculate the total amount of tea James needs for a week:**
   James uses 2 kilograms of tea per day.
   Total tea for a week = 2 kg/day * 7 days
   = 14 kg

4. **Calculate the total cost of the tea:**
   Total cost of tea = Cost per kilogram * Total amount of tea
   = ₣21/kg * 14 kg
   = ₣294

5. **Calculate the total cost including the cookie:**
   Total cost = Cost of tea + Cost of cookie
   = ₣294 + ₣2
   = ₣296

So, everything cost ₣296.",296.0,1,"First, let's calculate the additional cost per kilogram for the more expensive brand of tea.

The more expensive brand costs 40% more than the normal brand, which is ₣15 per kilogram.

40% of ₣15 is (40/100) * ₣15 = ₣6.

So, the more expensive brand costs ₣15 + ₣6 = ₣21 per kilogram.

James uses 2 kilograms of tea per day, so for a week (7 days), he will need 2 * 7 = 14 kilograms of tea.

The cost for 14 kilograms of the more expensive tea is 14 * ₣21 = ₣294.

He also decided to buy himself a cookie for ₣2. How much did everything cost?,296.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Calculate the additional cost per kilogram for the more expensive brand:**
   The more expensive brand costs 40% more than the normal brand.
   Additional cost = 40% of ₣15
   = (40/100) * ₣15
   = 0.4 * ₣15
   = ₣6

2. **Calculate the cost per kilogram of the more expensive brand:**
   Cost per kilogram of the more expensive brand = Normal cost + Additional cost
   = ₣15 + ₣6
   = ₣21

3. **Calculate the total amount of tea James needs for a week:**
   James uses 2 kilograms of tea per day.
   Total tea for a week = 2 kg/day * 7 days
   = 14 kg

4. **Calculate the total cost of the tea:**
   Total cost of tea = Cost per kilogram * Total amount of tea
   = ₣21/kg * 14 kg
   = ₣294

5. **Calculate the total cost including the cookie:**
   Total cost = Cost of tea + Cost of cookie
   = ₣294 + ₣2
   = ₣296

So, everything cost ₣296.",296.0,1,"First, let's calculate the additional cost per kilogram for the more expensive brand of tea.

The more expensive brand costs 40% more than the normal brand, which is ₣15 per kilogram.

40% of ₣15 is (40/100) * ₣15 = ₣6.

So, the more expensive brand costs ₣15 + ₣6 = ₣21 per kilogram.

James uses 2 kilograms of tea per day, so for a week (7 days), he will need 2 * 7 = 14 kilograms of tea.

The cost for 14 kilograms of the more expensive tea is 14 * ₣21 = ₣294.

Additionally, James buys a cookie for ₣2.

Therefore, the total cost for the tea and the cookie is ₣294 + ₣2 = ₣296.

1. **Calculate the water used for giant cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 12 ounces.
   - Santiago makes 8 giant cubes.
   - So, the total water used for giant cubes is 8 * 12 = 96 ounces.

2. **Calculate the water used for small cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces (since 1/2 ounce is 0.5 ounces).
   - Santiago makes 14 small cubes.
   - So, the total water used for small cubes is 14 * 0.5 = 7 ounces.

3. **Calculate the water used for medium cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 11 ounces.
   - Santiago makes 15 medium cubes.
   - So, the total water used for medium cubes is 15 * 11 = 165 ounces.

4. **Calculate the total water used:**
   - Total water used = water for giant cubes + water for small cubes + water for medium cubes

Question: Kimia has a flower bed that is 180 feet long. Kimia wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Kimia's flowers grow 3 feet wide so she needs to leave 15.0 feet between every plant. Kimia already owns 11 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ¥3 at the store, how much money will Kimia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?
Your initial answer was: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many plants Kimia can fit in her 180-foot-long flower bed, considering the space each plant requires, and then calculate the cost of the additional plants she needs to buy.

1. **Calculate the total space required for each plant:**
   Each plant grows 3 feet wide and requires 15.0 feet of space between plants. So, the total space required for each plant is:
   3 feet (width of the plant) + 15.0 feet (space between plants) = 18.0 feet per plant.

2. **Determine how many plants can fit in the 180-foot flower bed:**
   The total length of the flower bed is 180 feet. To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the total length by the space required per plant:
   180 feet / 18.0 feet per plant = 10 plants.

3. **Calculate the number of additional plants Kimia needs to buy:**
   Kimia already owns 11 plants. Since she can fit 10 plants in the flower bed, she does not need to buy any additional plants.

4. **Calculate the cost of the additional plants:**
   Since Kimia does not need to buy any additional plants, the cost will be:
   0 plants * ¥3 per plant = ¥0.

The answer is ¥0.
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","### Reflection

**Explanation:**
I incorrectly assumed that the total space required for each plant included the space between plants. However, the correct interpretation should consider the space between plants as additional space, not included in the width of the plant. This led to an incorrect calculation of the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed.

**Error Keywords:**
- Misinterpretation of problem constraints
- Incorrect calculation of space requirements
- Miscalculation of the number of plants
- Incorrect application of arithmetic operations

### Corrected Solution

1. **Calculate the total space required for each plant:**
   Each plant grows 3 feet wide and requires 15.0 feet of space between plants. So, the total space required for each plant is:
   3 feet (width of the plant) + 15.0 feet (space between plants) = 18.0 feet per plant.

2. **Determine how many plants can fit in the 180-foot flower bed:**
   The total length of the flower bed is 180 feet. To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the total length by the space required per plant:
   180 feet / 18.0 feet per plant = 10 plants.

3. **Calculate the number of additional plants Kimia needs to buy:**
   Kimia already owns 11 plants. Since she can fit 10 plants in the flower bed, she does not need to buy any additional plants.

4. **Calculate the cost of the additional plants:**
   Since Kimia does not need to buy any additional plants, the cost will be:
   0 plants * ¥3 per plant = ¥0.

The answer is ¥0.

### Instructions for Future Problems

1. **Read the problem carefully** to understand the constraints and requirements.
2. **Identify the key variables** and their relationships (e.g., width of the plant, space between plants, total length of the flower bed).
3. **Calculate the total space required for each plant** correctly, considering the space between plants as additional space.
4. **Determine the number of plants that can fit in the given space** by dividing the total length by the space required per plant.

Solution:
1. The total length of the garden is 200 feet.
2. Each tree requires 4 feet of space plus 12 feet of space between trees, totaling 16 feet per tree.
3. 200 feet / 16 feet/tree = 12.5 trees. Since we can't have half a tree, we round up to 13 trees.
4. Maria already has 10 trees, so she needs to buy 3 more.
5. The cost will be 3 trees * ¥5/tree = ¥15.

### Corrected Solution

1. **Determine the total length of the flower bed:**
   The total length of the flower bed is 180 feet.

2. **Calculate the total space required for one plant, including the space between plants:**
   Each plant requires 3 feet of space plus 15 feet of space between plants, totaling 18 feet per plant.

3. **Divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space required for one plant to find the number of plants needed:**
   180 feet / 18 feet/plant = 10 plants.

4. **Account for the space between the first and last plant:**
   Since we can't have half a plant, we need to round up to ensure the entire length is covered. Therefore, we need 11 plants to cover the 180 feet.

5. **Subtract the number of plants already owned from the total number of plants needed:**
   Kimia already has 11 plants, so she does not need to buy any more.

3. **Calculate the number of additional plants Kimia needs to buy:**
   Kimia already owns 11 plants. Since the flower bed can accommodate 10 plants, she does not need to buy any additional plants.

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   Since Kimia does not need to buy any additional plants, the total cost will be:

main,gsm-symbolic,mistralai/mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501,Fatima can peel 10 clams a minute and saute 30 clams in 7 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 90 clams?,30.0,"To solve this problem, we need to consider the time it takes for Fatima to peel and saute the clams separately and then combine these times to find the total time required.

### Step 1: Calculate the time to peel 90 clams

Fatima can peel 10 clams in 1 minute. Therefore, to peel 90 clams:

\[
\text{Time to peel 90 clams} = \frac{90 \text{ clams}}{10 \text{ clams per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time to saute 90 clams

Fatima can saute 30 clams in 7 minutes. To find out how long it takes to saute 90 clams, we can set up a proportion:

\[
\frac{30 \text{ clams}}{7 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{90 \text{ clams}}{x \text{ minutes}}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
30x = 7 \times 90
\]

\[
30x = 630
\]

\[
x = \frac{630}{30} = 21 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Combine the times

Now, we add the time to peel 90 clams and the time to saute 90 clams:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to saute}
\]

\[
\text{Total time} = 9 \text{ minutes} + 21 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

   - Total points = 1 (history) + 10 (economics) + 10 (chemistry) = 21 points.

Emma is sure to get 21 points.",21.0,1,"To solve this, we need to calculate the number of questions in each category and then determine how many Emma will get correct.

1. **Calculate the number of history questions:**
   - 20% of 100 questions are history.
   - So, the number of history questions is 20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 questions.

2. **Calculate the number of economics and chemistry questions:**
   - The rest of the questions are equally divided between economics and chemistry.
   - So, the remaining questions are 100 - 20 = 80 questions.
   - Each of economics and chemistry has 80 / 2 = 40 questions.

3. **Calculate the number of questions Emma will get correct in each category:**
   - For history, Emma gets 5% correct.
     - So, she gets 5% of 20 = 0.05 * 20 = 1 question correct.
   - For economics and chemistry, Emma gets 25% correct.
     - So, she gets 25% of 40 = 0.25 * 40 = 10 questions correct for each subject.

4. **Calculate the total number of questions Emma will get correct:**
   - Total correct questions = 1 (history) + 10 (economics) + 10 (chemistry) = 21 questions.

Now, look at this question:
Question: If Rania and Kimia have 900 yards of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Kimia getting 30 yards more than Rania, how much is left over for Rania?
Your initial answer was: To solve this problem, we need to determine how much fence each person gets and then find out how much is left over for Rania.

1. Let's denote the amount of fence Rania gets as \( R \) yards.
2. Since Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, Kimia gets \( R + 30 \) yards.
3. The total amount of fence is 900 yards, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   R + (R + 30) = 900
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2R + 30 = 900
   \]
5. Subtract 30 from both sides:
   \[
   2R = 870
   \]
6. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   R = 435
   \]
7. So, Rania gets 435 yards of fence.
8. Since Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, Kimia gets:
   \[
   435 + 30 = 465 \text{ yards}
   \]
9. To find out how much is left over for Rania, we need to check if the total adds up to 900 yards:
   \[
   435 + 465 = 900
   \]
10. Since the total is exactly 900 yards, there is no leftover for Rania.

The answer is 0.
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","**Explanation:**
The initial answer was incorrect because I interpreted the question as asking for the amount of fence Rania would have after splitting 900 yards of fence. However, the question asks for the amount left over for Rania. So, the error was in interpreting the question incorrectly.

**Error Keywords:**
- Misinterpretation of the question
- Logic error
- Misunderstanding the problem's requirements

**Solution (Corrected):**
1. Let's denote the amount of fence Rania gets as \( R \) yards.
2. Kimia gets \( R + 30 \) yards.
3. The total amount of fence is 900 yards, so we set up the equation:
   \[
   R + (R + 30) = 900
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2R + 30 = 900
   \]
5. Subtract 30 from both sides:
   \[
   2R = 870
   \]
6. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   R = 435
   \]
7. Rania gets 435 yards, and Kimia gets:
   \[
   435 + 30 = 465 \text{ yards}
   \]
8. The total amount of fence is 900 yards, and the sum of Rania's and Kimia's fences is:
   \[
   435 + 465 = 900
   \]
9. The correct interpretation of ""how much is left over for Rania?"" is the remainder when the total fence is divided by the sum of the fences they would have after splitting 900 yards.
   \[
   900 - (435 + 465) = 900 - 900 = 0
   \]
10. Therefore, the answer is 0.

**Instructions:**
1. Read the question carefully to understand what is being asked.
2. Identify the variables and set up the equation based on the given information.
3. Solve the equation step-by-step.
4. Interpret the results correctly based on the question's requirements.

[Example Input]
Question: If Aisha and Leila have 1200 meters of rope between them, and they agree to split it with Leila getting 40 meters more than Aisha, how much is left over for Aisha?
Wrong answer: I calculated that Aisha would get 580 meters and Leila 620 meters, so there would be no leftover. I added the 40 meters to the total and divided by 2, assuming the difference was split evenly.

Correct Answer: Aisha would get 570 meters and Leila 630 meters, with 40 meters leftover.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the distribution of the additional 40 meters. I incorrectly added the 40 meters to the total and divided by 2, which does not account for the additional amount Leila should receive.

Error Keywords:
- Incorrect distribution of additional quantity
- Misapplication of division
- Misinterpretation of the problem's constraints

Instructions:
1. Identify the total quantity and the additional amount one person receives.
2. Subtract the additional amount from the total quantity to find the base amount.
3. Divide the base amount by 2 to find the amount each person gets before the additional amount.
4. Add the additional amount to one person's share.
5. Calculate the leftover by subtracting the total amount given to both persons from the original total quantity.

Advice:
- Always carefully read the problem to understand how the additional quantity should be distributed.
- Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with division and distribution.
- Ensure that the total quantities add up correctly after distributing the additional amount.

Solution:
Let's solve the example problem step-by-step:
1. Total rope = 1200 meters
2. Leila gets 40 meters more than Aisha.
3. Base amount = 1200 - 40 = 1160 meters
4. Each person gets 1160 / 2 = 580 meters before the additional amount.
5. Aisha gets 580 meters, Leila gets 580 + 40 = 620 meters.
6. Leftover = 1200 - (580 + 620) = 40 meters.

So, Aisha gets 580 meters, Leila gets 620 meters, and there are 40 meters leftover.

**Explanation:**
I initially answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the distribution of the additional 30 yards. I incorrectly added the 30 yards to the total and divided by 2, which does not account for the additional amount Kimia should receive.

**Error Keywords:**
- Incorrect distribution of additional quantity
- Misapplication of division
- Misinterpretation of the problem's constraints

### Solution

Let's solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the total quantity and the additional amount one person receives.**
   - Total fence = 900 yards
   - Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania.

2. **Subtract the additional amount from the total quantity to find the base amount.**
   - Base amount = 900 - 30 = 870 yards

3. **Divide the base amount by 2 to find the amount each person gets before the additional amount.**
   - Each person gets 870 / 2 = 435 yards before the additional amount.

4. **Add the additional amount to one person's share.**
   - Rania gets 435 yards
   - Kimia gets 435 + 30 = 465 yards

5. **Calculate the leftover by subtracting the total amount given to both persons from the original total quantity.**
   - Total given to both = 435 + 465 = 900 yards

According to the problem, Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, so Kimia gets R + 30 yards.

The total amount of fence they have together is 900 yards. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

R + (R + 30) = 900

Now, let's solve for R:

2R + 30 = 900

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2R = 900 - 30
2R = 870

Divide both sides by 2:

R = 870 / 2
R = 435

So, Rania gets 435 yards of fence. Since Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, Kimia gets:

435 + 30 = 465 yards

To check if the numbers add up correctly:

435 (Rania's yard) + 465 (Kimia's yard) = 900 yards

Therefore, Rania has 435 yards of fence, and there is no leftover.",435.0,1,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much fence each person gets and then find out how much is left over for Rania.

1. Let's denote the amount of fence Rania gets as \( R \) yards.
2. Since Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, Kimia gets \( R + 30 \) yards.
3. The total amount of fence is 900 yards, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   R + (R + 30) = 900
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2R + 30 = 900
   \]
5. Subtract 30 from both sides:
   \[
   2R = 870
   \]
6. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   R = 435
   \]
7. So, Rania gets 435 yards of fence.
8. Since Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, Kimia gets:
   \[
   435 + 30 = 465 \text{ yards}
   \]
9. To find out how much is left over for Rania, we need to check if the total adds up to 900 yards:
   \[
   435 + 465 = 900
   \]
10. Since the total is exactly 900 yards, there is no leftover for Rania.

**Explanation:**
I miscalculated the amount of fence Rania gets by not properly accounting for the extra 30 yards that Kimia receives. I should have first determined the total amount of fence that Rania and Kimia would have together after accounting for the extra 30 yards, and then divided that amount by 2.

**Error Keywords:**
- Division
- Subtraction
- Word problem
- Distribution of resources
- Extra amount

### Correct Solution:

1. **Determine the total amount of fence that Rania and Kimia would have together after accounting for the extra 30 yards that Kimia receives.**
   - Total fence = 900 yards
   - Extra for Kimia = 30 yards
   - Total fence after accounting for extra = 900 - 30 = 870 yards

2. **Divide the total amount of fence by 2 to find out how much fence Rania would get.**
   - Rania's share = 870 / 2 = 435 yards

3. **Subtract the extra 30 yards that Kimia receives from the amount of fence that Rania would get (this is not necessary as it's only the initial allocation)**
   - This step is not necessary as we have already accounted for the extra 30 yards in step 1.

4. **The remaining amount of fence is what Rania would have.**
   - Rania's final amount = 435 yards

### Instructions for Future:

1. **Identify the total amount of resources (fence, ribbon, etc.) and the extra amount one person receives.**
2. **Subtract the extra amount from the total to find the amount to be split evenly.**
3. **Divide the adjusted total by 2 to find the amount for one person.**
4. **Verify that the extra amount has been correctly accounted for in the initial subtraction.**
5. **Ensure the final calculation reflects the correct distribution.**

### General Advice:

- **Carefully read the problem to understand the distribution and any extra amounts.**
- **Account for the extra amount in the initial calculation to avoid errors in division.**
- **Double-check each step to ensure the extra amount is correctly factored in.**
- **Practice similar problems to improve accuracy and understanding of distribution and subtraction in word problems.**","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

Hiroshi spends a total of 42 hours a week learning.",42.0,1,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Hiroshi spends in class during the week and then add the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday.

1. **Calculate the total number of classes Hiroshi attends each day:**
   - Normal classes per day: 7
   - Extra classes: 2
   - Total classes per day: 7 + 2 = 9

2. **Calculate the total minutes Hiroshi spends in class each day:**
   - Each class is 35 minutes long.
   - Total minutes per day: 9 classes * 35 minutes/class = 315 minutes

3. **Calculate the total minutes Hiroshi spends in class each week:**
   - He goes to class for 4 days a week.
   - Total minutes per week: 315 minutes/day * 4 days/week = 1260 minutes

4. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - He spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.
   - Extra learning time per day (Saturday and Sunday): (3/6) * 1260 minutes = 630 minutes
   - Total extra learning time for both days: 630 minutes/day * 2 days = 1260 minutes

5. **Calculate the total learning time for the week:**
   - Total class time: 1260 minutes
   - Total extra learning time: 1260 minutes
   - Total learning time: 1260 minutes + 1260 minutes = 2520 minutes

6. **Convert the total learning time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Total learning hours: 2520 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 42 hours

If 66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 27-mile walk, in minutes?",90.0,"Let's denote Emma's walking speed on the beach as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, her walking speed on the sidewalk is \( 4v \) miles per hour.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Emma to walk 11 miles on the beach. We know that she spends 66 minutes on the beach. To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

\[ 66 \text{ minutes} = \frac{66}{60} \text{ hours} = 1.1 \text{ hours} \]

Since she walks 11 miles in 1.1 hours on the beach, her speed on the beach \( v \) is:

\[ v = \frac{11 \text{ miles}}{1.1 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we know her speed on the sidewalk is \( 4v \), which is:

\[ 4v = 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk 16 miles on the sidewalk. Using the speed on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on sidewalk}} = \frac{16 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.4 \text{ hours} \]

To convert 0.4 hours to minutes, we multiply by 60:

\[ 0.4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 24 \text{ minutes} \]

Question: Alice picked 4 apples, the first apple weighs 200 grams, the second apple weighs 250 grams, and the last apple weighs 300 grams. If a gram of apple costs ¥0.02, how much will she earn after selling all the apples to the market?
Wrong answer: Alice will earn ¥15.00. (The mistake here is that the weights were not added together correctly before converting to total earnings.)

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I incorrectly added the weights of the apples and then multiplied by the cost per gram, resulting in an incorrect total.

Error Keywords:
- Arithmetic error
- Incorrect addition
- Incorrect currency conversion

Instructions:
1. First, identify the weights of each apple.
2. Add the weights of all the apples together.
3. Multiply the total weight by the cost per gram.
4. Ensure that the units are correctly handled throughout the calculation.

Advice:
- Double-check arithmetic calculations, especially when dealing with multiple values.
- Pay attention to the units of measurement and ensure they are consistent.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid errors.

Solution:
1. Weights of the apples: 200g, 250g, 300g

   Ali dropped three-sixths of his marbles.
   \[
   \text{Number of marbles dropped} = \frac{3}{6} \times 96 = \frac{1}{2} \times 96 = 48
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of marbles Ali had left after dropping some:**
   \[
   \text{Number of marbles left} = 96 - 48 = 48
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of marbles Ali found:**
   Ali found 18 marbles.

4. **Calculate the total number of marbles Ali had after finding some:**
   \[
   \text{Total marbles after finding} = 48 + 18 = 66
   \]

5. **Account for the beads:**
   Ali found that 2 of the marbles were actually beads, so he got rid of them.
   \[
   \text{Total marbles after removing beads} = 66 - 2 = 64
   \]

So, Ali ended up with 64 marbles.",64.0,1,"Ali starts with 96 marbles.
He drops three-sixths of them, so he drops 96 * (3/6) = 96 * 0.5 = 48 marbles.
He is left with 96 - 48 = 48 marbles.
He finds 18 of the dropped marbles, so he has 48 + 18 = 66 marbles.
He realizes 2 of these are not marbles, so he discards them, leaving him with 66 - 2 = 64 marbles.
