She bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, and 60 mini cheesecakes. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes before the discount.

Sophia bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen. Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, she bought 60/12 = 5 dozens of donuts. So, the cost of the donuts is 5 * $19 = $95.

Similarly, she bought 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen. So, she also bought 60/12 = 5 dozens of mini cupcakes. The cost of the mini cupcakes is 5 * $33 = $165.

Now, let's calculate the total cost before the discount for donuts and mini cupcakes:
Total cost (donuts + mini cupcakes) = $95 + $165 = $260.

Let x be the cost of a dozen mini cheesecakes. Since she bought 60 mini cheesecakes, she bought 60/12 = 5 dozens of mini cheesecakes. So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is 5x.

The total cost before the discount for all pastries is the sum of the cost of donuts, mini cupcakes, and mini cheesecakes:
Total cost before discount = $260 + 5x.

Sophia received a 20% discount on the total cost. Let's denote the total cost after the discount as T. We know that T = $1500.

The relationship between the total cost before the discount and the total cost after the discount is given by:
T = Total cost before discount - (20% of Total cost before discount).

Substituting the known values, we get:
$1500 = ($260 + 5x) - 0.20 * ($260 + 5x).

Now, let's solve for x:
$1500 = $260 + 5x - 0.20 * $260 - 0.20 * 5x
$1500 = $260 + 5x - $52 - x
$1500 = $208 + 4x
$1500 - $208 = 4x

Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?",350.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

First, let's calculate the healthy daily calorie target for both Hiroshi and Tara.

For Hiroshi:
220 lbs * 15 calories/lb = 3300 calories

For Tara:
140 lbs * 15 calories/lb = 2100 calories

Next, let's calculate how many calories Hiroshi and Tara have left to consume to reach their healthy daily calorie target.

For Hiroshi:
3300 calories (target) - 1100 calories (consumed) + 200 calories (burned) = 2400 calories left

For Tara:
2100 calories (target) - 900 calories (consumed) - 200 calories (ice cream) = 1000 calories left

She already has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges of her large country home. She also purchased 200 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Daphne remain with?",335.0,"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of potted plants Daphne has on her window ledges:**
   She has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges.
   Total plants on ledges = 8 plants/ledge * 56 ledges = 448 plants

2. **Add the 23 new potted plants she received two days ago:**
   Total plants after receiving 23 new ones = 448 plants + 23 plants = 471 plants

3. **Calculate the number of plants she purchased yesterday:**
   She bought 200 new plants at a 50% discount, but the discount doesn't affect the quantity, so she still has 200 new plants.

4. **Add the 200 new plants to her total:**
   Total plants after purchasing 200 new ones = 471 plants + 200 plants = 671 plants

5. **Calculate how many plants she will give away:**
   She plans to give away 6 plants from each of the 56 ledges.
   Total plants to give away = 6 plants/ledge * 56 ledges = 336 plants

Explanation:
I miscalculated the total number of apples and oranges after giving away 15% and did not account for the percentage correctly. I also did not break down the problem into smaller steps, which led to errors in my calculations.

Error Keywords:
- Multi-step arithmetic
- Distribution of items
- Percentage calculations
- Subtraction errors

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total number of apples and oranges Emily has after eating and giving away some.
2. Add the additional apples and oranges Emily buys.
3. Calculate 15% of the total number of apples and oranges.
4. Subtract the 15% from the total number of apples and oranges to find out how many she has left.

Advice:
- Break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
- Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with percentages.
- Ensure you understand the sequence of operations required to solve the problem.

Solution:
1. Emily starts with 30 apples and 40 oranges.
2. After eating 5 apples and giving away 10 oranges, she has 25 apples and 30 oranges.
3. She then buys 20 more apples and 30 more oranges, bringing her total to 45 apples and 60 oranges.
4. Calculate 15% of the total number of apples and oranges: 15% of 105 (45 apples + 60 oranges) is 15.75. Since we can't have a fraction of an apple or orange, we'll round down to 15.
5. Subtract 15 from the total number of apples and oranges: 105 - 15 = 90.
6. Emily has 90 apples and oranges left, but we need to distribute them back into apples and oranges. Since she has more oranges, she gives away 15 oranges, leaving her with 45 apples and 45 oranges.

Emily has 45 apples and 45 oranges left.

However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city, taking into account the change in wind speed.

First, let's determine the distance that constitutes 1/4 of the city:
1/4 of 80 miles = 80 miles / 4 = 20 miles

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for the fog bank to cover 20 miles under normal conditions (before the wind speed is halved). We know that the fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes. Therefore, the speed of the fog bank is:
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 4 miles / 60 minutes = 1/15 miles per minute

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to cover 20 miles at this speed:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 20 miles / (1/15 miles per minute) = 20 * 15 minutes = 300 minutes

However, after 60 minutes, the wind speed is halved. This means that for the remaining distance, the fog bank will move at half the speed. Since 60 minutes have passed, the fog bank has already covered:
Distance covered in 60 minutes = 60 minutes * (1/15 miles per minute) = 4 miles

The remaining distance to cover 1/4 of the city (20 miles) is:
Remaining distance = 20 miles - 4 miles = 16 miles

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes to cover the remaining 16 miles at half the original speed. The new speed is:
New speed = 1/15 miles per minute / 2 = 1/30 miles per minute

The time to cover the remaining 16 miles at the new speed is:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 16 miles / (1/30 miles per minute) = 16 * 30 minutes = 480 minutes

Therefore, the total time to cover 1/4 of the city is the sum of the time before and after the wind speed change:

1. First, determine the distance that constitutes 1/4 of the city:
   - The city is 80 miles across.
   - 1/4 of the city is 80 / 4 = 20 miles.

2. Calculate the initial speed of the fog bank:
   - The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes.
   - Therefore, the speed of the fog bank is 4 miles per 60 minutes or 4/60 miles per minute.

3. Determine how much of the 20 miles the fog bank will cover in the first hour before the wind speed is halved:
   - In 60 minutes, the fog bank covers 4 miles.
   - So, in the first hour, the fog bank will cover 4 miles.

4. Calculate the remaining distance to cover 20 miles after the first hour:
   - The remaining distance is 20 - 4 = 16 miles.

5. Determine the new speed of the fog bank after the wind speed is halved:
   - The original speed is 4/60 miles per minute.
   - The new speed is (4/60) / 2 = 4/120 miles per minute.

6. Calculate the time it takes to cover the remaining 16 miles at the new speed:
   - The time to cover 16 miles at 4/120 miles per minute is 16 / (4/120) = 16 * (120/4) = 16 * 30 = 480 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for the fog bank to cover 20 miles under normal conditions (before the wind speed is halved). We know that the fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes. Therefore, the speed of the fog bank is:
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 4 miles / 60 minutes = 1/15 miles per minute

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to cover 20 miles at this speed:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 20 miles / (1/15 miles per minute) = 20 * 15 minutes = 300 minutes

However, after 60 minutes, the wind speed is halved. This means that for the remaining distance, the fog bank will move at half the speed. Since 60 minutes have passed, the fog bank has already covered:
Distance covered in 60 minutes = 60 minutes * (1/15 miles per minute) = 4 miles

The remaining distance to cover 1/4 of the city (20 miles) is:
Remaining distance = 20 miles - 4 miles = 16 miles

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes to cover the remaining 16 miles at half the original speed. The new speed is:
New speed = 1/15 miles per minute / 2 = 1/30 miles per minute

The time to cover the remaining 16 miles at the new speed is:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 16 miles / (1/30 miles per minute) = 16 * 30 minutes = 480 minutes

Therefore, the total time to cover 1/4 of the city is the sum of the time before and after the wind speed change:
Total time = 60 minutes (initial 4 miles) + 480 minutes (remaining 16 miles) = 540 minutes

So, it will take 540 minutes for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city.",4.0,0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city, given that the wind speed will be halved after one hour.

1. First, determine the distance that constitutes 1/4 of the city:
   - The city is 80 miles across.
   - 1/4 of the city is 80 / 4 = 20 miles.

2. Calculate the initial speed of the fog bank:
   - The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes.
   - Therefore, the speed of the fog bank is 4 miles per 60 minutes or 4/60 miles per minute.

3. Determine how much of the 20 miles the fog bank will cover in the first hour before the wind speed is halved:
   - In 60 minutes, the fog bank covers 4 miles.
   - So, in the first hour, the fog bank will cover 4 miles.

4. Calculate the remaining distance to cover 20 miles after the first hour:
   - The remaining distance is 20 - 4 = 16 miles.

5. Determine the new speed of the fog bank after the wind speed is halved:
   - The original speed is 4/60 miles per minute.
   - The new speed is (4/60) / 2 = 4/120 miles per minute.

6. Calculate the time it takes to cover the remaining 16 miles at the new speed:
   - The time to cover 16 miles at 4/120 miles per minute is 16 / (4/120) = 16 * (120/4) = 16 * 30 = 480 minutes.

7. Add the time taken in the first hour to the time taken to cover the remaining distance:
   - Total time = 60 minutes (first hour) + 480 minutes (remaining distance) = 540 minutes.

The answer is 540 minutes.",540.0,1,0.0,1.0,540.0,,,,,,,,

She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, and uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,"Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as S, the number of cups of water as W, the number of tablespoons of milk as M, and the number of tablespoons of heavy cream as C.

From the given information, we have the following ratios:
1. Sugar to water: S:W = 54:27
2. Milk to water: M:W = 8:8
3. Cream to sugar: C:S = 2:54

We can simplify the ratios:
1. S:W = 54:27 simplifies to 2:1 (dividing both sides by 27)
2. M:W = 8:8 simplifies to 1:1 (dividing both sides by 8)
3. C:S = 2:54 simplifies to 1:27 (dividing both sides by 2)

Now, let's express W, M, and C in terms of S using the simplified ratios:
1. W = S/2 (since S:W = 2:1)
2. M = W (since M:W = 1:1, and W = S/2, so M = S/2)
3. C = S/27 (since C:S = 1:27)

The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk used is 240. So we can write the equation:
S + W + M + C = 240

Substitute W, M, and C in terms of S:
S + (S/2) + (S/2) + (S/27) = 240

Combine like terms:
S + S/2 + S/2 + S/27 = 240

She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?
Your initial answer was: To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given ratios and the total amount of ingredients used.

1. **Identify the ratios:**
   - Sugar to water: 54:27
   - Milk to water: 8:8 (which simplifies to 1:1)
   - Cream to sugar: 2:54

2. **Simplify the sugar to water ratio:**
   - The ratio 54:27 simplifies to 2:1.

3. **Set up variables:**
   - Let \( S \) be the number of teaspoons of sugar.
   - Let \( W \) be the number of cups of water.
   - Let \( M \) be the number of tablespoons of milk.
   - Let \( C \) be the number of tablespoons of cream.

4. **Establish the relationships based on the ratios:**
   - From the sugar to water ratio: \( S : W = 2 : 1 \) implies \( W = \frac{1}{2}S \).
   - From the milk to water ratio: \( M : W = 1 : 1 \) implies \( M = W \).
   - From the cream to sugar ratio: \( C : S = 2 : 54 \) implies \( C = \frac{2}{54}S = \frac{1}{27}S \).

5. **Total amount of ingredients:**
   - The total amount of all ingredients is 240.
   - Therefore, \( S + W + M + C = 240 \).

6. **Substitute the relationships into the total equation:**
   - \( S + \frac{1}{2}S + \frac{1}{2}S + \frac{1}{27}S = 240 \).
   - Combine like terms: \( S + \frac{1}{2}S + \frac{1}{2}S + \frac{1}{27}S = S + S + \frac{1}{27}S = 2S + \frac{1}{27}S \).
   - Simplify further: \( 2S + \frac{1}{27}S = \frac{54}{27}S + \frac{1}{27}S = \frac{55}{27}S \).

7. **Solve for \( S \):**
   - \( \frac{55}{27}S = 240 \).
   - \( S = 240 \times \frac{27}{55} \).
   - \( S = \frac{240 \times 27}{55} \).
   - \( S = \frac{6480}{55} \).
   - \( S = 117.818181818 \).

Since the question implies the number of teaspoons of sugar must be a whole number, this suggests there might be an error in the problem setup or the calculations. However, if we round to the nearest whole number, the number of teaspoons of sugar \( S \) is approximately 118.

The answer is 118.

She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,"Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as S, the number of cups of water as W, the number of tablespoons of milk as M, and the number of tablespoons of heavy cream as C.

From the given information, we have the following ratios:
1. Sugar to water: S:W = 54:27
2. Milk to water: M:W = 8:8
3. Cream to sugar: C:S = 2:54

We can simplify the ratios:
1. S:W = 54:27 simplifies to 2:1 (dividing both sides by 27)
2. M:W = 8:8 simplifies to 1:1 (dividing both sides by 8)
3. C:S = 2:54 simplifies to 1:27 (dividing both sides by 2)

Now, let's express W, M, and C in terms of S using the simplified ratios:
1. W = S/2 (since S:W = 2:1)
2. M = W (since M:W = 1:1, and W = S/2, so M = S/2)
3. C = S/27 (since C:S = 1:27)

The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk used is 240. So we can write the equation:
S + W + M + C = 240

Substitute W, M, and C in terms of S:
S + (S/2) + (S/2) + (S/27) = 240

Combine like terms:
S + S/2 + S/2 + S/27 = 240
(27S + 13.5S + 13.5S + S) / 27 = 240
(55S) / 27 = 240

Multiply both sides by 27 to get rid of the denominator:
55S = 240 * 27

Now, calculate the right side:
55S = 6480

Divide both sides by 55 to solve for S:
S = 6480 / 55
S = 117.818181818...

Since the number of teaspoons of sugar must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number:

She noticed that she was out of plastic forks, so she bought a new package of forks. Later, her husband also bought a package of 8 new forks and gave them to Aisha. While Aisha was making the stuffed peppers, she used sixteen of the forks to sample her stuffed peppers, then threw away 6 defective forks. The guests also brought 2 packs of forks, each having 6 inside them. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 32 forks. How many forks were in the package that Aisha bought?",34.0,"Let's denote the number of forks in the package that Aisha bought as F.

Aisha's husband bought a package of 8 forks.
Aisha used 16 forks for sampling and threw away 6 defective forks, so she used a total of 16 + 6 = 22 forks.
The guests brought 2 packs of forks, with 6 forks in each pack, so they brought 2 * 6 = 12 forks.

When Aisha went to set the table, she had a total of 32 forks. This total includes the forks from the package she bought, the forks her husband bought, the forks the guests brought, and the forks she used and threw away.

So, the equation to represent this situation is:
F (Aisha's package) + 8 (husband's package) - 22 (used and thrown away) + 12 (guests' forks) = 32 (total forks)

Now, let's solve for F:
F + 8 - 22 + 12 = 32
F - 2 = 32
F = 32 + 2
F = 34

Therefore, the package that Aisha bought contained 34 forks.",34.0,1,"To find out how many forks were in the package that Aisha bought, we need to work backwards from the total number of forks she had when she set the table.

In the span of two years, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?",1764.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

**Banana Field:**

1. First, we need to find out how many bananas are produced per square yard.
   - We know that there are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard.
   - So, to find out how many bananas are in a full square yard, we divide 36 by 4/5 (or 0.8):
     \[
     \text{Bananas per square yard} = \frac{36}{0.8} = 45 \text{ bananas}
     \]

2. Next, we calculate the total number of bananas produced in 10 square yards:
   - Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field.
   - So, the total number of bananas is:
     \[
     \text{Total bananas} = 10 \times 45 = 450 \text{ bananas}
     \]

3. Now, we determine how many times Ravi can harvest in two years (24 months):
   - Ravi can harvest every 4 months.
   - So, the number of harvests in two years is:
     \[
     \text{Number of harvests} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ times}
     \]

4. Finally, we calculate the total number of bananas harvested in two years:
   - The total number of bananas harvested is:
     \[
     \text{Total bananas in two years} = 450 \times 6 = 2700 \text{ bananas}
     \]

**Apricot Field:**

1. We calculate the total number of apricots produced in 13 square yards:
   - Ravi has 13 square yards of apricot field.
   - The apricot field produces 12 apricots per square yard.
   - So, the total number of apricots is:
     \[
     \text{Total apricots} = 13 \times 12 = 156 \text{ apricots}
     \]

2. We determine how many times Ravi can harvest in two years (24 months):
   - Ravi can harvest every 4 months.
   - So, the number of harvests in two years is:
     \[
     \text{Number of harvests} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ times}
     \]

3. Finally, we calculate the total number of apricots harvested in two years:
   - The total number of apricots harvested is:
     \[
     \text{Total apricots in two years} = 156 \times 6 = 936 \text{ apricots}

**Comparison:**

1. We compare the total number of bananas and apricots harvested in two years:
   - Total bananas in two years = 2700
   - Total apricots in two years = 936

2. We find the difference:
   - The difference in the number of bananas and apricots is:
     \[

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost before any discount:
Total cost = $57 + $116 + $11 + $56 = $240

Next, let's calculate the total cost with the 5% discount (without membership):
5% discount on $240 = 0.05 * $240 = $12
Total cost with 5% discount = $240 - $12 = $228

Now, let's calculate the total cost with the 20% discount (with membership):
20% discount on $240 = 0.20 * $240 = $48
Total cost with 20% discount = $240 - $48 = $192

However, we must also consider the one-time $20 membership fee:
Total cost with membership and 20% discount = $192 + $20 = $212

Now, let's compare the two options:
- Total cost without membership (5% discount): $228
- Total cost with membership (20% discount): $212

The least amount Arjun can spend on everything is with the membership:

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a twenty-sided die:**
   - There are 20 possible outcomes.
   - Numbers greater than 5 are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
   - There are 15 numbers greater than 5.
   - Probability of rolling a number greater than 5: \(\frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75\).

2. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row:**
   - Since the rolls are independent, we multiply the probabilities:
   \[
   P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) = 0.75 \times 0.75 = 0.5625
   \]

### Event 2: Rolling four even numbers in a row

1. **Probability of rolling an even number on a twenty-sided die:**
   - There are 20 possible outcomes.
   - Even numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.

[Example Input]
Question: What is the probability that a six-sided die will land on an even number three times in a row, and how much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) than rolling a number greater than 4 three times in a row?
Wrong answer: The probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die is 1/2. Therefore, the probability of rolling an even number three times in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8 or 12.5%. The probability of rolling a number greater than 4 (i.e., 5 or 6) is 2/6 or 1/3. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 three times in a row is (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/27 or approximately 3.7%. The difference in percentage points is 12.5% - 3.7% = 8.8%.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 on a six-sided die. The correct probability is 2/6, not 1/3.
Error Keywords:
- Probability calculation
- Dice roll outcomes

2. Identify the favorable outcomes for rolling an even number: 2, 4, 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes.
3. Calculate the probability of rolling an even number: 3/6 = 1/2.
4. Calculate the probability of rolling an even number three times in a row: (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8 or 12.5%.
5. Identify the favorable outcomes for rolling a number greater than 4: 5, 6. There are 2 favorable outcomes.
6. Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 4: 2/6 = 1/3.
7. Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 three times in a row: (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/27 or approximately 3.7%.
8. Calculate the difference in percentage points: 12.5% - 3.7% = 8.8%.
Advice:
- Always double-check the number of favorable outcomes for each event.
- Ensure that the probability calculations are correct for each step.
- Convert probabilities to percentages accurately.
- Understand the concept of independent events and apply it correctly.
Solution:
The probability of rolling an even number three times in a row is 12.5%. The probability of rolling a number greater than 4 three times in a row is approximately 3.7%. The difference in percentage points is 12.5% - 3.7% = 8.8%.

   Mia found 2/3 as many beetles as bees. She saw 9 bees.
   So, the number of beetles is (2/3) * 9 = 6.

3. **Calculate the total number of animals:**
   We have the number of rabbits (13), wasps (24), bees (9), and beetles (6).
   So, the total number of animals is 13 + 24 + 9 + 6 = 52.

4. **Calculate the percentage of rabbits:**
   The percentage of rabbits is (number of rabbits / total number of animals) * 100.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Mrs. Lee is looking for a new townhouse that will not go beyond her $340000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $400000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?
Your initial answer was: To determine how much more the total cost will be than Mrs. Lee's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the property including the discount, brokerage fee, and transfer fee.

1. **Calculate the discounted selling price:**
   - The original selling price is $400,000.
   - Mrs. Lee gets a 25% discount on the selling price.
   - The discount amount is 25% of $400,000, which is (25/100) * $400,000 = $100,000.
   - The discounted selling price is $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000.

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   - The brokerage fee is 5% of the original selling price.
   - The brokerage fee is (5/100) * $400,000 = $20,000.

3. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   - The transfer fee is 12% of the original selling price.
   - The transfer fee is (12/100) * $400,000 = $48,000.

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the discounted selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee.
   - Total cost = $300,000 (discounted selling price) + $20,000 (brokerage fee) + $48,000 (transfer fee) = $368,000.

5. **Determine how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Lee's budget:**
   - Mrs. Lee's budget is $340,000.
   - The difference is $368,000 (total cost) - $340,000 (budget) = $28,000.

The answer is $28,000.

","### Reflection

**Explanation:**
I incorrectly calculated the total cost by not applying the discount to the brokerage and transfer fees. The discount should have been applied to the selling price before calculating the fees.

**Error Keywords:**
- Calculation error
- Arithmetic error
- Misapplication of discount
- Incorrect fee calculation

### Corrected Solution:

1. **Calculate the discounted selling price:**
   - The original selling price is $400,000.
   - Mrs. Lee gets a 25% discount on the selling price.
   - The discount amount is 25% of $400,000, which is (25/100) * $400,000 = $100,000.
   - The discounted selling price is $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000.

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee on the discounted price:**
   - The brokerage fee is 5% of the discounted selling price.
   - The brokerage fee is (5/100) * $300,000 = $15,000.

3. **Calculate the transfer fee on the discounted price:**
   - The transfer fee is 12% of the discounted selling price.
   - The transfer fee is (12/100) * $300,000 = $36,000.

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the discounted selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee.
   - Total cost = $300,000 (discounted selling price) + $15,000 (brokerage fee) + $36,000 (transfer fee) = $351,000.

5. **Determine how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Lee's budget:**
   - Mrs. Lee's budget is $340,000.
   - The difference is $351,000 (total cost) - $340,000 (budget) = $11,000.

The answer is $11,000.

[Example Input]
Question: Mr. Smith is looking for a new car that will not go beyond his $25,000 budget. He saw a car that has a selling price of $30,000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a sales tax which is 8% of the selling price, and also the registration fee that is 3% of the selling price. If Mr. Smith can get a 20% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mr. Smith's budget?
Wrong answer: Mr. Smith's total cost will be $2,000 more than his budget. I calculated the discount on the selling price as $6,000 (20% of $30,000), then added the sales tax and registration fee on the discounted price, which resulted in a total cost of $27,000. I then subtracted the budget from this total cost to find the difference.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the discount on the selling price and did not account for the taxes and fees on the discounted price correctly.
Error Keywords:
- Financial calculations
- Percentage calculations
- Budgeting
- Discount calculations
- Tax and fee calculations
Instructions:
1. Calculate the discount on the selling price.
2. Subtract the discount from the selling price to get the discounted price.
3. Calculate the sales tax and registration fee based on the discounted price.
4. Add the sales tax, registration fee, and the discounted price to get the total cost.
5. Subtract the budget from the total cost to find the difference.
Advice:
- Always double-check percentage calculations.
- Ensure that taxes and fees are calculated on the correct base amount.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid errors.
Solution:
1. Calculate the discount: 20% of $30,000 = $6,000.
2. Subtract the discount from the selling price: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.
3. Calculate the sales tax: 8% of $24,000 = $1,920.
4. Calculate the registration fee: 3% of $24,000 = $720.
5. Add the sales tax, registration fee, and the discounted price: $24,000 + $1,920 + $720 = $26,640.
6. Subtract the budget from the total cost: $26,640 - $25,000 = $1,640.
Mr. Smith's total cost will be $1,640 more than his budget.

She scooped up 21 kgs. She also bought a mixed bag of sand dollars for ₺11.0 and 12 postcards that were ₺21.0 each. Priya then donated ₺5 at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Priya have left?
Your initial answer was: First, let's calculate the cost of the fudge. Priya bought 21 kgs of fudge. The first 15 kgs are at the full price of ₺22 per kg, and the remaining 6 kgs are at a 1/4 off discount.

The cost of the first 15 kgs is:
15 kgs * ₺22/kg = ₺330

The discount on the remaining 6 kgs is 1/4 off of ₺22, which is:
₺22 * 1/4 = ₺5.5

So, the discounted price per kg for the remaining 6 kgs is:
₺22 - ₺5.5 = ₺16.5

The cost of the remaining 6 kgs is:
6 kgs * ₺16.5/kg = ₺99

The total cost of the fudge is:
₺330 + ₺99 = ₺429

Next, let's calculate the cost of the postcards. Each postcard is ₺21, and she bought 12 of them:
12 postcards * ₺21/postcard = ₺252

Now, let's add up all of Priya's expenses:
- Fudge: ₺429
- Sand dollars: ₺11
- Postcards: ₺252
- Charity donation: ₺5

Total expenses = ₺429 + ₺11 + ₺252 + ₺5 = ₺697

Question: Alex went shopping with ₺1500. He bought a shirt for ₺80, a pair of shoes for ₺120, and a hat for ₺30. He also got a discount of 20% on the shoes. Additionally, he spent ₺20 on a coffee. How much money does Alex have left?
Wrong answer: Alex spent ₺80 + ₺120 + ₺30 + ₺20 = ₺250. He had ₺1500 - ₺250 = ₺1250 left. He did not account for the discount on the shoes.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I did not account for the discount on the shoes, which led to an incorrect total spending amount.
Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Omission of discount
- Incorrect total spending
Instructions:

2. Calculate the discount on the discounted item.
3. Subtract the discount from the original price of the discounted item.
4. Sum up the costs of all items, including the discounted price.
5. Subtract the total spending from the initial amount of money.
Solution:
1. Shirt: ₺80
2. Shoes: ₺120 with a 20% discount, so the discount is ₺120 * 0.20 = ₺24. The discounted price is ₺120 - ₺24 = ₺96.
3. Hat: ₺30
4. Coffee: ₺20
5. Total spending: ₺80 + ₺96 + ₺30 + ₺20 = ₺226
6. Money left: ₺1500 - ₺226 = ₺1274

Advice:
- Always check for discounts or special offers on items.

**Explanation:**
I incorrectly calculated the cost of the fudge due to a misunderstanding of the discount offer. I did not properly account for the ""Buy 15 kgs at ₺22 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/4 off"" offer, which led to an incorrect total spending amount.

**Error Keywords:**
- Misinterpretation of the discount offer
- Incorrect calculation of the discounted price
- Omission of the correct discount application
- Miscalculation of total spending

### Solution:

1. **Calculate the cost of the fudge:**
   - Priya bought 21 kgs of fudge.
   - The first 15 kgs are at ₺22 per kg: 15 kgs * ₺22/kg = ₺330
   - The remaining 6 kgs are at the discounted price.
   - The discount is 1/4 off, so the discounted price per kg is ₺22 * (1 - 1/4) = ₺22 * 0.75 = ₺16.5
   - The cost for the remaining 6 kgs is 6 kgs * ₺16.5/kg = ₺99

2. **Total cost of the fudge:**
   - Total cost = ₺330 (first 15 kgs) + ₺99 (remaining 6 kgs) = ₺429

3. **Calculate the cost of the other items:**
   - Mixed bag of sand dollars: ₺11.0
   - 12 postcards at ₺21.0 each: 12 * ₺21.0 = ₺252

4. **Total spending:**
   - Total spending = ₺429 (fudge) + ₺11.0 (sand dollars) + ₺252 (postcards) + ₺5 (donation) = ₺697

5. **Money left:**
   - Money left = ₺1200 - ₺697 = ₺503

### Instructions:

1. Identify all items and their costs.
2. Calculate the cost of the fudge, considering the discount offer.
3. Calculate the cost of the other items.
4. Sum up the costs of all items.
5. Subtract the total spending from the initial amount of money.

### Advice:

[Example Input]
Question: Alex went shopping with ₺1500. He bought a shirt for ₺80, a pair of shoes for ₺120, and a hat for ₺30. He also got a discount of 20% on the shoes. Additionally, he spent ₺20 on a coffee. How much money does Alex have left?
Wrong answer: Alex spent ₺80 + ₺120 + ₺30 + ₺20 = ₺250. He had ₺1500 - ₺250 = ₺1250 left. He did not account for the discount on the shoes.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I did not account for the discount on the shoes, which led to an incorrect total spending amount.
Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Omission of discount
- Incorrect total spending
Instructions:
1. Identify all items and their costs.
2. Calculate the discount on the discounted item.
3. Subtract the discount from the original price of the discounted item.
4. Sum up the costs of all items, including the discounted price.
5. Subtract the total spending from the initial amount of money.
Solution:
1. Shirt: ₺80
2. Shoes: ₺120 with a 20% discount, so the discount is ₺120 * 0.20 = ₺24. The discounted price is ₺120 - ₺24 = ₺96.
3. Hat: ₺30
4. Coffee: ₺20
5. Total spending: ₺80 + ₺96 + ₺30 + ₺20 = ₺226
6. Money left: ₺1500 - ₺226 = ₺1274

Advice:
- Always check for discounts or special offers on items.
- Double-check the total spending by reviewing each item and its cost.
- Ensure all transactions are accounted for, including small expenses like coffee.

How much money does Priya have left?",492.0,"Let's calculate Priya's expenses step by step.

1. **Fudge Purchase:**
   - Priya bought 21 kgs of fudge.
   - The first 15 kgs are at ₺22 per kg.
   - The remaining 6 kgs (21 kgs - 15 kgs) are at a 1/4 off discount.

   First, calculate the cost of the first 15 kgs:
   \[
   15 \text{ kgs} \times ₺22/\text{kg} = ₺330
   \]

   Next, calculate the discount for the remaining 6 kgs:
   \[
   \text{Discount per kg} = \frac{1}{4} \times ₺22 = ₺5.5
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discounted price per kg} = ₺22 - ₺5.5 = ₺16.5
   \]
   \[
   6 \text{ kgs} \times ₺16.5/\text{kg} = ₺99
   \]

   Total cost for fudge:
   \[
   ₺330 + ₺99 = ₺429
   \]

2. **Sand Dollars:**
   - The mixed bag of sand dollars costs ₺11.0.

3. **Postcards:**
   - Each postcard costs ₺21.0.
   - Priya bought 12 postcards.
   \[
   12 \text{ postcards} \times ₺21.0/\text{postcard} = ₺252
   \]

4. **Charity Donation:**
   - Priya donated ₺5.

Now, let's sum up all her expenses:
\[
₺429 \text{ (fudge)} + ₺11.0 \text{ (sand dollars)} + ₺252 \text{ (postcards)} + ₺5 \text{ (donation)} = ₺707
\]

Finally, subtract the total expenses from the amount her parents gave her:
\[
₺1200 - ₺707 = ₺493
\]

Priya has ₺493 left.",493.0,0,"First, let's calculate the cost of the fudge. Priya bought 21 kgs of fudge. The first 15 kgs are at the full price of ₺22 per kg, and the remaining 6 kgs are at a 1/4 off discount.

The cost of the first 15 kgs is:
15 kgs * ₺22/kg = ₺330

The discount on the remaining 6 kgs is 1/4 off of ₺22, which is:
₺22 * 1/4 = ₺5.5

So, the discounted price per kg for the remaining 6 kgs is:
₺22 - ₺5.5 = ₺16.5

The cost of the remaining 6 kgs is:
6 kgs * ₺16.5/kg = ₺99

The total cost of the fudge is:
₺330 + ₺99 = ₺429

Next, let's calculate the cost of the postcards. Each postcard is ₺21, and she bought 12 of them:
12 postcards * ₺21/postcard = ₺252

Now, let's add up all of Priya's expenses:
- Fudge: ₺429
- Sand dollars: ₺11
- Postcards: ₺252
- Charity donation: ₺5

Total expenses = ₺429 + ₺11 + ₺252 + ₺5 = ₺697

#### Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the discount on the fudge and did not account for the cost of the mixed bag of sand dollars and the donation. I also misinterpreted the discount offer and the total amount of fudge purchased.

#### Error Keywords:
- Discount calculation
- Unit price misunderstanding
- Total expense summation
- Misinterpretation of offer details

### Corrected Solution:

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the fudge without the discount.
   - Priya buys 21 kgs of fudge.
   - The first 15 kgs cost ₺22 per kg.
   - 15 kgs * ₺22/kg = ₺330.

Step 2: Calculate the discount on the remaining 6 kgs.
   - The discount is 1/4 off for 4 kgs.
   - For 4 kgs, the discount is (1/4) * 4 kgs * ₺22/kg = ₺22.
   - For 2 kgs (remaining amount), the price remains ₺22/kg.
   - 2 kgs * ₺22/kg = ₺44.
   - Total for the additional 6 kgs (4 kgs discounted + 2 kgs regular) = ₺44 + ₺22 = ₺66.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the fudge.
   - Total cost of fudge = ₺330 + ₺66 = ₺396.

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the mixed bag of sand dollars.
   - Cost of the mixed bag of sand dollars = ₺11.0.

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the postcards.
   - 12 postcards * ₺21.0 each = ₺252.

Step 6: Calculate the donation.
   - Donation = ₺5.

Step 7: Sum up all the expenses.
   - Total expenses = ₺396 (fudge) + ₺11.0 (sand dollars) + ₺252 (postcards) + ₺5 (donation) = ₺664.

Step 8: Subtract the total expenses from the initial amount.
   - Money left = ₺1200 - ₺664 = ₺536.

### Solution:
Priya has ₺536 left.

### Instructions for Future Problems:
1. Identify all items and their respective prices.
2. Carefully interpret the discount offer, including the quantity and percentage of the discount.
3. Calculate the cost of each item, applying the correct discount where applicable.
4. Sum up the cost of all items and additional expenses (e.g., donations).
5. Subtract the total expenses from the initial amount to find the remaining money.

### General Advice:
- Always break down the problem into smaller steps.
- Double-check each calculation, especially for discounts and total expenses.
- Ensure all items and expenses are accounted for in the final sum.
- Pay close attention to the details of any discount offers and apply them correctly.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

**Explanation:**
I incorrectly calculated the cost of the fudge due to a misunderstanding of the discount structure. I did not correctly apply the ""Buy 15 kgs at ₺22 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/4 off"" discount. Additionally, I miscalculated the total cost of the postcards and did not account for the donation correctly.

**Error Keywords:**
- Misinterpretation of discount structure
- Incorrect calculation of fudge cost
- Miscalculation of postcard cost
- Incorrect subtraction of donation

### Solution

1. **Calculate the cost of the fudge:**
   - Priya bought 21 kgs of fudge.
   - The first 15 kgs cost ₺22 per kg: 15 kgs * ₺22/kg = ₺330
   - The remaining 6 kgs are subject to the discount. The discount is 1/4 off, so the discounted price per kg is ₺22 - (1/4 * ₺22) = ₺22 - ₺5.5 = ₺16.5 per kg.
   - The cost for the 6 kgs is 6 kgs * ₺16.5/kg = ₺99

2. **Calculate the total cost of the fudge:**
   - Total cost of fudge = ₺330 + ₺99 = ₺429

3. **Calculate the cost of the sand dollars:**
   - The mixed bag of sand dollars costs ₺11.0

4. **Calculate the cost of the postcards:**
   - 12 postcards at ₺21.0 each: 12 * ₺21.0 = ₺252

5. **Sum up the total expenses:**
   - Total expenses = Cost of fudge + Cost of sand dollars + Cost of postcards
   - Total expenses = ₺429 + ₺11.0 + ₺252 = ₺692

6. **Calculate the remaining money after purchases:**
   - Remaining money = Initial amount - Total expenses
   - Remaining money = ₺1200 - ₺692 = ₺508

7. **Subtract the donation:**
   - Remaining money after donation = ₺508 - ₺5 = ₺503

Priya has ₺503 left.

### Instructions

1. **Identify the discount structure:**
   - Clearly understand the terms of the discount (e.g., ""Buy 15 kgs at ₺22 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/4 off"").
   - Determine the cost per kg for the discounted and non-discounted portions.

2. **Calculate the cost of each item:**
   - For the fudge, calculate the cost of the non-discounted and discounted portions separately.
   - For other items, multiply the quantity by the unit price.

3. **Sum up the total expenses:**
   - Add the costs of all items to get the total expenses.

4. **Subtract the total expenses from the initial amount:**
   - Calculate the remaining money after all purchases.

5. **Subtract the donation:**
   - Deduct the donation from the remaining money to get the final amount.

### Advice

- **Handling Discounts:**
  - Carefully read and interpret the discount terms.
  - Calculate the discounted and non-discounted portions separately.

- **Calculating Costs:**
  - List all items and their costs to avoid missing any.
  - Double-check the calculations for each item.

Question: Maria went shopping with ₺1500. She bought a dress for ₺250, a pair of shoes for ₺180, and a bag for ₺300. She also bought a book for ₺50 and a toy for ₺70. She then donated ₺30 to a charity. How much money does Maria have left?

Wrong answer: Maria has ₺650 left. I incorrectly calculated the total cost of the items and did not account for the donation correctly.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total cost of the items and did not subtract the donation correctly. I added the cost of the dress, shoes, and bag correctly, but I forgot to add the cost of the book and toy. I also subtracted the donation from the incorrect total.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation of total cost
- Incorrect subtraction of donation
- Forgetting to add all items

Instructions:
1. List all the items and their costs.
2. Sum up the total cost of all items.
3. Subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money.
4. Subtract the donation from the remaining amount.

Advice:
- Always list all items and their costs to avoid missing any.
- Double-check the total cost before subtracting the donation.
- Ensure all transactions are accounted for in the final calculation.

Solution:
Maria has ₺650 left.
1. Dress: ₺250
2. Shoes: ₺180
3. Bag: ₺300
4. Book: ₺50
5. Toy: ₺70
Total cost: ₺250 + ₺180 + ₺300 + ₺50 + ₺70 = ₺850
Remaining money after purchases: ₺1500 - ₺850 = ₺650

What percentage of all the puppies have spots?",90.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

First, let's find out how many puppies have spots after Jamal's visit to the vet.

Jamal's dog originally has 23 spotted puppies. The number of unspotted puppies is 131 - 23 = 108.

After the vet visit, half of these unspotted puppies are found to have spots. So, the number of newly spotted puppies is 108 / 2 = 54.

Now, the total number of spotted puppies Jamal has is 23 (originally spotted) + 54 (newly spotted) = 77.

Next, let's calculate the total number of puppies and the total number of spotted puppies for all three individuals.

Jamal's total puppies = 131
Gabriel's total puppies = 47
Yuki's total puppies = 54 * 13 = 702 (since each of Yuki's 54 dogs has 13 puppies with spots)

Total puppies = 131 (Jamal) + 47 (Gabriel) + 702 (Yuki) = 880

Total spotted puppies = 77 (Jamal) + 13 (Gabriel) + 702 (Yuki) = 792

Now, to find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we use the formula:

Percentage of spotted puppies = (Total spotted puppies / Total puppies) * 100

Percentage of spotted puppies = (792 / 880) * 100

Percentage of spotted puppies = 0.9 * 100

Now, add the initially spotted puppies to the ones now discovered to have spots: 54 (newly discovered spotted) + 23 (initially spotted) = 77 puppies with spots for Jamal.

Gabriel's dog has 47 puppies with 13 having spots. So, 13 puppies have spots for Gabriel.

Yuki has 54 dogs, each with 13 puppies with spots. So, 54 * 13 = 704 puppies with spots for Yuki.

After a visit to the vet, Jamal discovered that half of his unspotted puppies actually have spots that were not visible before. What percentage of all the puppies have spots?
Your initial answer was: First, let's find out how many puppies with spots Jamal has after the vet visit. Jamal has 131 puppies in total, with 23 initially having spots. This means 131 - 23 = 108 puppies did not have visible spots initially.

At the vet, Jamal discovers that half of the unspotted puppies actually have spots. So, half of 108 is 108 / 2 = 54 puppies.

Now, add the initially spotted puppies to the ones now discovered to have spots: 54 (newly discovered spotted) + 23 (initially spotted) = 77 puppies with spots for Jamal.

Gabriel's dog has 47 puppies with 13 having spots. So, 13 puppies have spots for Gabriel.

Yuki has 54 dogs, each with 13 puppies with spots. So, 54 * 13 = 704 puppies with spots for Yuki.

Now, let's find the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Total puppies with spots = 77 (Jamal) + 13 (Gabriel) + 704 (Yuki) = 794 puppies with spots.

Total puppies = 131 (Jamal) + 47 (Gabriel) + (54 * 13) (Yuki) = 131 + 47 + 704 = 882 puppies.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

(Total puppies with spots / Total puppies) * 100

So, the percentage is (794 / 882) * 100 ≈ 90.02%.

Calculate the percentage of spotted puppies: (495/560) * 100 = 88.39%.
Therefore, 88.39% of all the puppies have spots.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Jamal's dog has 131 puppies, 23 of which have spots. Gabriel's dog has 47 puppies, 13 of which have spots. Yuki has 54 dogs, each having 13 puppies with spots. After a visit to the vet, Jamal discovered that half of his unspotted puppies actually have spots that were not visible before. What percentage of all the puppies have spots?

Carlos has 720 almonds, 7 bowls and 3 tables. Unfortunately, 2 tables break. Carlos then eats one-fifth of all the almonds. How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?",14.0,"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Calculate the capacity of each table:**
   Each table can hold three times the amount of almonds as a bowl. Since each bowl holds 24 almonds, each table can hold:
   \[
   3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ almonds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the tables before any break:**
   Carlos has 3 tables, so the total capacity of the tables is:
   \[
   3 \times 72 = 216 \text{ almonds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls:**
   Carlos has 7 bowls, so the total capacity of the bowls is:
   \[
   7 \times 24 = 168 \text{ almonds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total capacity of all containers before any break:**
   The total capacity of the bowls and tables combined is:
   \[
   216 + 168 = 384 \text{ almonds}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining capacity after 2 tables break:**
   Since 2 tables break, the capacity lost is:
   \[
   2 \times 72 = 144 \text{ almonds}
   \]
   Therefore, the remaining capacity is:
   \[
   384 - 144 = 240 \text{ almonds}
   \]

6. **Calculate the number of almonds Carlos eats:**
   Carlos eats one-fifth of all the almonds:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 720 = 144 \text{ almonds}
   \]

7. **Calculate the remaining almonds after Carlos eats some:**
   The remaining almonds are:
   \[
   720 - 144 = 576 \text{ almonds}
   \]

8. **Calculate the additional bowls needed:**
   The remaining capacity of the containers (bowls and the one unbroken table) is 240 almonds. Therefore, the number of additional almonds that need to be accommodated is:
   \[
   576 - 240 = 336 \text{ almonds}
   \]
   Since each bowl can hold 24 almonds, the number of additional bowls needed is:
   \[
   \frac{336}{24} = 14 \text{ bowls}
   \]

Therefore, Carlos needs 14 more bowls to place all the remaining almonds.",14.0,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the capacity of each table:**
   Each table can hold three times the number of almonds as a bowl.
   So, each table can hold 24 * 3 = 72 almonds.

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and tables before any break:**
   Carlos has 7 bowls and 3 tables.
   The total capacity of the bowls is 7 * 24 = 168 almonds.
   The total capacity of the tables is 3 * 72 = 216 almonds.
   So, the total capacity before any break is 168 + 216 = 384 almonds.

3. **Calculate the total capacity after 2 tables break:**
   Since 2 tables break, we have 1 table left.
   The capacity of the remaining table is 1 * 72 = 72 almonds.
   So, the total capacity after the break is 168 (bowls) + 72 (1 table) = 240 almonds.

4. **Calculate the number of almonds left after Carlos eats one-fifth:**
   Carlos eats one-fifth of all the almonds.
   One-fifth of 720 almonds is 720 / 5 = 144 almonds.
   So, the number of almonds left is 720 - 144 = 576 almonds.

5. **Calculate how many more bowls Carlos needs:**
   Carlos can place 240 almonds in the remaining bowls and the table.
   He has 576 almonds left.
   So, he needs to place 576 - 240 = 336 more almonds.
   Since each bowl can hold 24 almonds, he needs 336 / 24 = 14 more bowls.

How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?",14.0,"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Calculate the capacity of each table:**
   Each table can hold three times the amount of almonds as a bowl. Since each bowl holds 24 almonds, each table can hold:
   \[
   3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ almonds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the tables before any break:**
   Carlos has 3 tables, so the total capacity of the tables is:
   \[
   3 \times 72 = 216 \text{ almonds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls:**
   Carlos has 7 bowls, so the total capacity of the bowls is:
   \[
   7 \times 24 = 168 \text{ almonds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total capacity of all containers before any break:**
   The total capacity of the bowls and tables combined is:
   \[
   216 + 168 = 384 \text{ almonds}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining capacity after 2 tables break:**
   Since 2 tables break, the capacity lost is:
   \[
   2 \times 72 = 144 \text{ almonds}
   \]
   Therefore, the remaining capacity is:
   \[
   384 - 144 = 240 \text{ almonds}
   \]

6. **Calculate the number of almonds Carlos eats:**
   Carlos eats one-fifth of all the almonds:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 720 = 144 \text{ almonds}
   \]

7. **Calculate the remaining almonds after Carlos eats some:**
   The remaining almonds are:
   \[
   720 - 144 = 576 \text{ almonds}
   \]

8. **Calculate the additional bowls needed:**
   The remaining capacity of the containers (bowls and the one unbroken table) is 240 almonds. Therefore, the number of additional almonds that need to be accommodated is:
   \[
   576 - 240 = 336 \text{ almonds}
   \]
   Since each bowl can hold 24 almonds, the number of additional bowls needed is:
   \[
   \frac{336}{24} = 14 \text{ bowls}
   \]

Therefore, Carlos needs 14 more bowls to place all the remaining almonds.",14.0,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the capacity of each table:**
   Each table can hold three times the number of almonds as a bowl.
   So, each table can hold 24 * 3 = 72 almonds.

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and tables before any break:**
   Carlos has 7 bowls and 3 tables.
   The total capacity of the bowls is 7 * 24 = 168 almonds.
   The total capacity of the tables is 3 * 72 = 216 almonds.
   So, the total capacity before any break is 168 + 216 = 384 almonds.

3. **Calculate the total capacity after 2 tables break:**
   Since 2 tables break, we have 1 table left.
   The capacity of the remaining table is 1 * 72 = 72 almonds.
   So, the total capacity after the break is 168 (bowls) + 72 (1 table) = 240 almonds.

4. **Calculate the number of almonds left after Carlos eats one-fifth:**
   Carlos eats one-fifth of all the almonds.
   One-fifth of 720 almonds is 720 / 5 = 144 almonds.
   So, the number of almonds left is 720 - 144 = 576 almonds.

5. **Calculate how many more bowls Carlos needs:**
   Carlos can place 240 almonds in the remaining bowls and the table.
   He has 576 almonds left.
   So, he needs to place 576 - 240 = 336 more almonds.
   Since each bowl can hold 24 almonds, he needs 336 / 24 = 14 more bowls.

Now, let's add the skeins needed for Keisha's jackets:

- Jackets: 8 skeins each x 2 jackets = 16 skeins

Next, we'll sum up all the skeins needed:

Total skeins = 20 (shawls) + 24 (sweaters) + 32 (ponchos) + 32 (gloves) + 56 (mittens) + 16 (jackets)
Total skeins = 180 skeins

Now, let's calculate the cost of the skeins. Since skeins are sold by the dozen (12 skeins per dozen), we need to find out how many dozens Keisha needs:

Total dozens = 180 skeins / 12 skeins per dozen
Total dozens = 15 dozens

Now, let's calculate the cost before the discount:

Cost before discount = 15 dozens x $7 per dozen
Cost before discount = $105

Since Keisha's purchase is over $100, she gets a $20 discount:

Cost after discount = $105 - $20
Cost after discount = $85

Keisha should pay $85 for all the skeins of wool she needs.",85.0,1,"First, let's calculate the total number of skeins Keisha needs for her grandchildren:

- Shawl: 5 skeins each x 4 grandchildren = 20 skeins

- Gloves: 8 skeins each x 4 grandchildren = 32 skeins
- Mittens: 14 skeins each x 4 grandchildren = 56 skeins

Now, let's add these up to find the total skeins needed for her grandchildren:
20 + 24 + 32 + 32 + 56 = 164 skeins

Next, let's calculate the skeins needed for Keisha's jackets:
- Jackets: 8 skeins each x 2 jackets = 16 skeins

Now, let's add the skeins needed for the grandchildren and the jackets:
164 + 16 = 180 skeins

Now, let's calculate the cost of the skeins. Since skeins are sold by the dozen (12 skeins), we need to find out how many dozens Keisha needs:
180 skeins / 12 skeins per dozen = 15 dozens

p2,gsm-symbolic,mistralai/mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501,Mohammed goes to the store to buy some rice. The normal brand of rice he buys costs ¥15 per kg. He has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 3 kgs of rice per day. The store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs; any additional rice is sold at the regular price. Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2. How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily rice consumption for a week:**
   Mohammed uses 3 kgs of rice per day. For a week (7 days), he will need:
   \[
   3 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ kg}
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of the more expensive brand of rice:**
   The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand. The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg, so the increase is:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } ¥15 = 0.20 \times 15 = ¥3
   \]
   Therefore, the cost per kg of the more expensive brand is:
   \[
   ¥15 + ¥3 = ¥18 \text{ per kg}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the first 10 kgs with the 40% discount:**
   The discount applies to the first 10 kgs. The discounted price per kg is:
   \[
   40\% \text{ of } ¥18 = 0.40 \times 18 = ¥7.2
   \]
   So, the discounted price per kg is:
   \[
   ¥18 - ¥7.2 = ¥10.8 \text{ per kg}
   \]
   The cost for the first 10 kgs is:
   \[
   10 \text{ kg} \times ¥10.8 \text{ per kg} = ¥108
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the remaining 11 kgs at the regular price:**
   The remaining 11 kgs (21 kg total - 10 kg discounted) will be at the regular price of ¥18 per kg:
   \[
   11 \text{ kg} \times ¥18 \text{ per kg} = ¥198
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the rice:**
   The total cost for the rice is the sum of the discounted and regular price portions:
   \[
   ¥108 + ¥198 = ¥306
   \]

6. **Add the cost of the bagel:**
   Mohammed also buys a bagel for ¥2. So, the total cost including the bagel is:
   \[
   ¥306 + ¥2 = ¥308
   \]

Therefore, Mohammed has to pay ¥308 in total.",308.0,1,"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice per kg.

The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand.
So, the additional cost per kg is 20% of ¥15, which is 0.20 * 15 = ¥3.

Therefore, the cost per kg of the more expensive brand is ¥15 + ¥3 = ¥18.

Next, let's determine how much rice Mohammed needs for a week.
He uses 3 kgs of rice per day, so for a week (7 days), he needs 3 * 7 = 21 kgs of rice.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Jasmine and Mia are sisters from Nairobi who love collecting signatures from authors. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Jasmine and Mia compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Jasmine has 36 signatures in her book, and Mia has 31. The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?
Your initial answer was: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of signatures Jasmine and Mia will have after the remaining 2 weeks and then determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week to reach their goal of 145 signatures.

1. **Calculate the total number of signatures they currently have:**
   Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   Mia has 31 signatures.
   So, the total number of signatures they have together is 36 + 31 = 67.

2. **Determine the number of signatures they need to reach their goal:**
   They want to reach 145 signatures in total.
   So, the number of signatures they still need is 145 - 67 = 78.

3. **Calculate the number of signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks:**
   Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week.
   So, for 2 weeks, her collection will be reduced by 5 * 2 = 10.
   Jasmine's current weekly collection is not specified, but we know she will collect 10 fewer signatures over the 2 weeks.

4. **Calculate the total number of signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks:**
   Since we don't know her current weekly collection, let's assume it's X signatures per week.
   Over 2 weeks, she will collect 2X signatures.
   But since she collects 10 fewer signatures over the 2 weeks, she will collect 2X - 10 signatures.

5. **Determine the number of signatures Mia needs to collect to reach the goal:**
   The total number of signatures needed is 78.
   Jasmine will collect 2X - 10 signatures.
   So, Mia needs to collect 78 - (2X - 10) signatures.

6. **Calculate the number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week:**
   Mia needs to collect 78 - (2X - 10) signatures over 2 weeks.
   Therefore, per week, Mia needs to collect (78 - (2X - 10)) / 2.

Since we don't have the value of X (Jasmine's current weekly collection), we cannot determine the exact number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week. However, we can express it in terms of X:

Mia needs to collect (78 - (2X - 10)) / 2 signatures per week.

To find the exact number, we would need the value of X.

","### Reflection

**Explanation:**
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not account for the reduction in Jasmine's weekly collection and the need to determine the exact number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week. I also did not correctly calculate the total number of signatures Jasmine would collect in the remaining 2 weeks.

**Error Keywords:**
- Calculation error
- Arithmetic error
- Misinterpretation of problem constraints
- Incomplete information handling

### Corrected Solution

1. **Calculate the total number of signatures they currently have:**
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   - Mia has 31 signatures.
   - Total signatures = 36 + 31 = 67.

2. **Determine the number of signatures they need to reach their goal:**
   - They want to reach 145 signatures in total.
   - Signatures needed = 145 - 67 = 78.

3. **Calculate the number of signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks:**
   - Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week.
   - For 2 weeks, her collection will be reduced by 5 * 2 = 10.
   - Jasmine's current weekly collection is not specified, but we know she will collect 10 fewer signatures over the 2 weeks.

4. **Calculate the total number of signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks:**
   - Let's assume Jasmine's current weekly collection is X signatures per week.
   - Over 2 weeks, she will collect 2X signatures.
   - But since she collects 10 fewer signatures over the 2 weeks, she will collect 2X - 10 signatures.

5. **Determine the number of signatures Mia needs to collect to reach the goal:**
   - The total number of signatures needed is 78.
   - Jasmine will collect 2X - 10 signatures.
   - So, Mia needs to collect 78 - (2X - 10) signatures.

6. **Calculate the number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week:**
   - Mia needs to collect 78 - (2X - 10) signatures over 2 weeks.
   - Therefore, per week, Mia needs to collect (78 - (2X - 10)) / 2.

Since we don't have the value of X (Jasmine's current weekly collection), we cannot determine the exact number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week. However, we can express it in terms of X:

Mia needs to collect (78 - (2X - 10)) / 2 signatures per week.

To find the exact number, we would need the value of X.

1. **Current Total Signatures:**
   Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures.
   Total signatures so far = 36 (Jasmine) + 31 (Mia) = 67 signatures.

2. **Goal:**
   They want to reach 145 signatures by the end of the 2 weeks.

3. **Remaining Signatures Needed:**
   145 (goal) - 67 (current total) = 78 signatures needed in the next 2 weeks.

4. **Jasmine's Collection Rate:**
   Jasmine's weekly collection rate is reduced by 5 signatures per week due to collecting only on weekends.
   If Jasmine was collecting 5 signatures per week, her new rate is 5 - 5 = 0 signatures per week.

5. **Mia's Collection Rate:**
   Let's denote Mia's new weekly collection rate as \( x \) signatures per week.

6. **Total Collection in 2 Weeks:**
   In 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect \( 0 \times 2 = 0 \) signatures.
   In 2 weeks, Mia will collect \( 2x \) signatures.

7. **Equation for Total Signatures:**
   The total signatures collected in 2 weeks by both sisters should be 78.

1. **Calculate the total number of signatures they currently have:**
   Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   Mia has 31 signatures.
   So, the total number of signatures they have together is 36 + 31 = 67.

2. **Determine the number of signatures they need to reach their goal:**
   They want to reach 145 signatures in total.
   So, the number of signatures they still need is 145 - 67 = 78.

3. **Calculate the number of signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks:**
   Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week.
   So, for 2 weeks, her collection will be reduced by 5 * 2 = 10.
   Jasmine's current weekly collection is not specified, but we know she will collect 10 fewer signatures over the 2 weeks.

5. **Determine the number of signatures Mia needs to collect to reach the goal:**
   The total number of signatures needed is 78.
   Jasmine will collect 2X - 10 signatures.

[Example Input]
Question: Alex and Jamie are brothers who love collecting stamps. During their summer vacation, they spend every week collecting stamps. After 4 weeks, Alex has 28 stamps, and Jamie has 22. The brothers have 3 more weeks of vacation, and they decide they want to reach 120 stamps between them by the end of the vacation. However, during the remaining 3 weeks, Alex is only able to collect stamps on weekends, reducing his weekly collection by 4 per week, while Jamie decides to increase his weekly collection. How many stamps will Jamie need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Wrong answer: I calculated the total signatures needed per week by dividing the total signatures needed by the number of weeks left, which is 40 stamps per week. I then subtracted 4 from Alex's weekly rate, leaving 16 stamps per week. I assumed Jamie would collect the remaining 24 stamps per week. This is incorrect because I did not account for the fact that the number of stamps Alex collects will change from week to week as the weeks pass.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of stamps needed per week for Jamie by assuming the total number needed was constant each week. I did not account for the change in Alex's collection rate over the weeks.

Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding rates
- Incorrect division
- Miscalculated weekly requirements

Instructions:
1. Determine the total number of stamps needed by the end of the vacation.
2. Calculate the average number of stamps needed per week to reach the goal.
3. Determine the reduction in Alex's collection rate due to the change in collection schedule.
4. Calculate Alex's reduced weekly collection rate over the remaining weeks.
5. Subtract the reduced weekly collection rate from the average weekly requirement to determine Jamie's weekly collection rate.

Advice:
- Ensure you carefully consider the changing rates of collection.
- Be mindful of the time constraints and how they affect the total required per week.
- Solve problems involving rates and goals methodically, breaking them down into smaller steps.

Solution:
First, calculate the total number of stamps needed by the end of the vacation: 120 stamps.
Next, calculate the average number of stamps needed per week for the remaining 3 weeks: 120 stamps / 3 weeks = 40 stamps per week.
Determine the reduction in Alex's collection rate: 4 stamps per week.
Calculate Alex's reduced weekly collection rate over the remaining weeks: 28 stamps / 4 weeks = 7 stamps per week, decreasing by 1 each week.
Subtract the reduced weekly collection rate from the average weekly requirement to determine Jamie's weekly collection rate: 40 stamps per week - (7 stamps per week - 1 stamp per week) = 34 stamps per week.

**Explanation:**
I initially answered the question incorrectly because I did not account for the changing rate of signatures Jasmine collects each week. I assumed a constant rate, which led to an incorrect calculation of the number of signatures Mia needed to collect.

**Error Keywords:**
- Misunderstanding rates
- Incorrect division
- Miscalculated weekly requirements
- Incorrect assumption of constant rate

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total number of signatures needed by the end of the break:**
   - Total signatures needed: 145

2. **Calculate the average number of signatures needed per week to reach the goal:**
   - Total weeks remaining: 2
   - Average signatures needed per week: 145 signatures / 2 weeks = 72.5 signatures per week

3. **Determine the reduction in Jasmine's collection rate due to the change in collection schedule:**
   - Reduction per week: 5 signatures

4. **Calculate Jasmine's reduced weekly collection rate over the remaining weeks:**
   - Jasmine's initial weekly collection rate: 36 signatures / 6 weeks = 6 signatures per week
   - Reduced weekly collection rate for the first week: 6 signatures - 5 signatures = 1 signature
   - Reduced weekly collection rate for the second week: 1 signature - 5 signatures = -4 signatures (which is not possible, so we assume 0 signatures for the second week)

5. **Subtract the reduced weekly collection rate from the average weekly requirement to determine Mia's weekly collection rate:**
   - First week: 72.5 signatures - 1 signature = 71.5 signatures
   - Second week: 72.5 signatures - 0 signatures = 72.5 signatures

Since Mia cannot collect half a signature, we need to adjust the numbers slightly. Mia needs to collect 72 signatures in the first week and 73 signatures in the second week to ensure they reach their goal.

**Instructions for Future Reference:**
1. Determine the total number of signatures needed by the end of the break.
2. Calculate the average number of signatures needed per week to reach the goal.
3. Determine the reduction in the first sister's collection rate due to the change in collection schedule.
4. Calculate the first sister's reduced weekly collection rate over the remaining weeks, accounting for the change in rate each week.
5. Subtract the reduced weekly collection rate from the average weekly requirement to determine the second sister's weekly collection rate.

**General Advice:**
- Ensure you carefully consider the changing rates of collection.
- Be mindful of the time constraints and how they affect the total required per week.
- Solve problems involving rates and goals methodically, breaking them down into smaller steps.
- Account for any constraints or limitations in the problem, such as the inability to collect half a signature.","**Adapted Self-Reflection Prompt**

Explanation:
I miscalculated the total number of stamps needed by not accounting for the reduction in Alex's collection rate. I also did not consider the current rates at which both Alex and Jamie are collecting stamps.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation of total stamps needed
- Incorrect rate calculation
- Ignoring the reduction in Alex's collection rate
- Not considering the current rates of collection

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total number of stamps needed in the remaining weeks.
2. Determine the current weekly collection rates for both Alex and Jamie.
3. Adjust Alex's collection rate based on the reduction.
4. Calculate the total number of stamps Alex will collect in the remaining weeks.
5. Subtract the total number of stamps Alex will collect from the total needed to find out how many stamps Jamie needs to collect.
6. Divide the number of stamps Jamie needs to collect by the number of weeks remaining to find the weekly collection rate for Jamie.

- Double-check calculations to avoid miscalculations.
- Be mindful of the specific details in the problem, such as reductions in collection rates.

Solution:
1. Total stamps needed by the end of the vacation: 200
2. Stamps already collected: 48 (Alex) + 40 (Jamie) = 88
3. Stamps needed in the remaining 4 weeks: 200 - 88 = 112
4. Alex's current weekly collection rate: 48 stamps / 8 weeks = 6 stamps/week
5. Reduced weekly collection rate for Alex: 6 - 3 = 3 stamps/week
6. Total stamps Alex will collect in 4 weeks: 3 stamps/week * 4 weeks = 12 stamps
7. Stamps Jamie needs to collect in 4 weeks: 112 - 12 = 100 stamps

4. **Jasmine's current weekly collection rate:** 36 signatures / 6 weeks = 6 signatures/week
5. **Reduced weekly collection rate for Jasmine:** 6 - 5 = 1 signature/week
6. **Total signatures Jasmine will collect in 2 weeks:** 1 signature/week * 2 weeks = 2 signatures
7. **Signatures Mia needs to collect in 2 weeks:** 78 - 2 = 76 signatures
8. **Weekly collection rate for Mia:** 76 signatures / 2 weeks = 38 signatures/week

Mia needs to collect 38 signatures per week to ensure they reach their goal of 145 signatures by the end of the break.

[Example Input]
Question: Alex and Jamie are friends who love collecting stamps. During their summer vacation, they spend every weekend collecting stamps. After 8 weeks, Alex has 48 stamps, and Jamie has 40. They have 4 more weeks of vacation, and they decide they want to reach 200 stamps between them by the end of the vacation. However, during the remaining 4 weeks, Alex is only able to collect stamps on weekends, reducing his weekly collection by 3 per week, while Jamie decides to increase his weekly collection. How many stamps will Jamie need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Wrong answer: Jamie needs to collect 10 stamps per week. I calculated the total number of stamps needed in the remaining weeks and divided it by 4, without considering the reduction in Alex's collection rate.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total number of stamps needed by not accounting for the reduction in Alex's collection rate. I also did not consider the current rates at which both Alex and Jamie are collecting stamps.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation of total stamps needed
- Incorrect rate calculation
- Ignoring the reduction in Alex's collection rate
- Not considering the current rates of collection

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total number of stamps needed in the remaining weeks.
2. Determine the current weekly collection rates for both Alex and Jamie.
3. Adjust Alex's collection rate based on the reduction.
4. Calculate the total number of stamps Alex will collect in the remaining weeks.
5. Subtract the total number of stamps Alex will collect from the total needed to find out how many stamps Jamie needs to collect.
6. Divide the number of stamps Jamie needs to collect by the number of weeks remaining to find the weekly collection rate for Jamie.

Advice:
- Always consider the current rates of collection and any changes in those rates.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps to ensure accuracy.
- Double-check calculations to avoid miscalculations.
- Be mindful of the specific details in the problem, such as reductions in collection rates.

Solution:
1. Total stamps needed by the end of the vacation: 200
2. Stamps already collected: 48 (Alex) + 40 (Jamie) = 88
3. Stamps needed in the remaining 4 weeks: 200 - 88 = 112
4. Alex's current weekly collection rate: 48 stamps / 8 weeks = 6 stamps/week
5. Reduced weekly collection rate for Alex: 6 - 3 = 3 stamps/week
6. Total stamps Alex will collect in 4 weeks: 3 stamps/week * 4 weeks = 12 stamps
7. Stamps Jamie needs to collect in 4 weeks: 112 - 12 = 100 stamps
8. Weekly collection rate for Jamie: 100 stamps / 4 weeks = 25 stamps/week

Jamie needs to collect 25 stamps per week to ensure they reach their goal of 200 stamps by the end of the vacation.

How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Current Total Signatures:**
   Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures.
   Total signatures so far = 36 (Jasmine) + 31 (Mia) = 67 signatures.

2. **Goal:**
   They want to reach 145 signatures by the end of the 2 weeks.

3. **Remaining Signatures Needed:**
   145 (goal) - 67 (current total) = 78 signatures needed in the next 2 weeks.

4. **Jasmine's Collection Rate:**
   Jasmine's weekly collection rate is reduced by 5 signatures per week due to collecting only on weekends.
   If Jasmine was collecting 5 signatures per week, her new rate is 5 - 5 = 0 signatures per week.

5. **Mia's Collection Rate:**
   Let's denote Mia's new weekly collection rate as \( x \) signatures per week.

6. **Total Collection in 2 Weeks:**
   In 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect \( 0 \times 2 = 0 \) signatures.
   In 2 weeks, Mia will collect \( 2x \) signatures.

7. **Equation for Total Signatures:**
   The total signatures collected in 2 weeks by both sisters should be 78.
   So, \( 0 + 2x = 78 \).

8. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \( 2x = 78 \)
   \( x = \frac{78}{2} \)
   \( x = 39 \)

Therefore, Mia needs to collect 39 signatures per week to ensure they reach their goal of 145 signatures by the end of the 2 weeks.",2.0,0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of signatures Jasmine and Mia will have after the remaining 2 weeks and then determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week to reach their goal of 145 signatures.

1. **Calculate the total number of signatures they currently have:**
   Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   Mia has 31 signatures.
   So, the total number of signatures they have together is 36 + 31 = 67.

2. **Determine the number of signatures they need to reach their goal:**
   They want to reach 145 signatures in total.
   So, the number of signatures they still need is 145 - 67 = 78.

3. **Calculate the number of signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks:**
   Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week.
   So, for 2 weeks, her collection will be reduced by 5 * 2 = 10.
   Jasmine's current weekly collection is not specified, but we know she will collect 10 fewer signatures over the 2 weeks.

4. **Calculate the total number of signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks:**
   Since we don't know her current weekly collection, let's assume it's X signatures per week.
   Over 2 weeks, she will collect 2X signatures.
   But since she collects 10 fewer signatures over the 2 weeks, she will collect 2X - 10 signatures.

5. **Determine the number of signatures Mia needs to collect to reach the goal:**
   The total number of signatures needed is 78.
   Jasmine will collect 2X - 10 signatures.
   So, Mia needs to collect 78 - (2X - 10) signatures.

6. **Calculate the number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week:**
   Mia needs to collect 78 - (2X - 10) signatures over 2 weeks.
   Therefore, per week, Mia needs to collect (78 - (2X - 10)) / 2.

Since we don't have the value of X (Jasmine's current weekly collection), we cannot determine the exact number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week. However, we can express it in terms of X:

Mia needs to collect (78 - (2X - 10)) / 2 signatures per week.

To find the exact number, we would need the value of X.",2.0,0,3.0,0.0,38.0,"--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

When they reach the gym, they remember they forgot their wallets at home, so they have to return to pick up their wallets and then walk all the way back to the gym again. Once they reach the gym for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the mall without being late?",42.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sofia and Benjamin start with 246 minutes to get to the mall.
2. It takes them 16 minutes to get to the corner where the cinema is.
3. It takes them another 52 minutes to get to the gym.

So far, they have spent:
16 minutes (to the cinema) + 52 minutes (to the gym) = 68 minutes

4. They realize they forgot their wallets and have to go back home. It will take them another 68 minutes to return home and then go back to the gym.
So, another 68 minutes.

5. They now have to walk from home to the gym again, which is another 68 minutes.

So, the total time spent so far is:
68 minutes (first trip to the gym) + 68 minutes (returning home and coming back) = 136 minutes

6. They have already spent 136 minutes, so the time remaining to get to the mall is:
246 minutes (initial time) - 136 minutes (time spent) = 110 minutes

Therefore, Sofia and Benjamin have 110 minutes left to get to the mall without being late.",110.0,0,"First, let's calculate the total time Sofia and Benjamin have spent walking before they realize they forgot their wallets.

They spend 16 minutes to get to the cinema.
Then they spend another 52 minutes to get to the gym.
So, the total time spent walking before returning is 16 + 52 = 68 minutes.

Next, they have to walk back to their home to pick up their wallets. This means they will walk the same distance of 52 min from the gym to their home.

After getting their wallets, they have to walk back to the gym, which is another 52 minutes.

So, the total time spent walking to the gym and back home and then back to the gym is 68 + 52 + 52 = 172 minutes.

Now, let's find out how much time they have left to get to the mall.

They started with 246 minutes.

You have incorrectly answered the following question:

**Adapted Example Question:**
Emma and Oliver have 300 minutes to walk to the park together starting from their house. It takes them 20 minutes to get to the library. It takes them another 40 minutes to get to the bakery. When they reach the bakery, they remember they forgot their keys at home, so they have to return to pick up their keys and then walk all the way back to the bakery again. Once they reach the bakery for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the park without being late?

**Wrong Answer:**
They have 300 - (20 + 40) = 240 minutes left after reaching the bakery for the first time. Since they have to walk back to the bakery, they will use up another 60 minutes.

How many ounces of water does Leon have left?",122.0,"First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for each size of ice cube.

For giant cubes:
10 giant cubes * 12 ounces per cube = 120 ounces

For medium cubes:
12 medium cubes * 5 ounces per cube = 60 ounces

For small cubes:
14 small cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 7 ounces

Now, let's determine the size of the tiny cubes. Since tiny cubes are half the size of small cubes, they use:
0.5 ounces / 2 = 0.25 ounces per tiny cube

Next, we need to find out how many tiny cubes Leon made. We know the total number of ice cubes is 48, so:

1. First, let's find out how many students like to bake. We know that the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football. Since 13 students like to play football, the number of students who like to bake is:
   4 * 13 - 3 = 52 - 3 = 49 students

What percentage of the students like to play video games if the number of the students that like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football?",5.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find out how many students like to bake. We know that the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football. Since 13 students like to play football, the number of students who like to bake is:
   4 * 13 - 3 = 52 - 3 = 49 students

2. Now, let's find out the total number of students who have hobbies other than playing video games. We add up the number of students who like to hike, play chess, swim, play football, and bake:
   69 (hike) + 8 (chess) + 13 (swim) + 13 (football) + 49 (bake) = 152 students

3. To find out how many students like to play video games, we subtract the number of students with other hobbies from the total number of students:
   160 (total students) - 152 (students with other hobbies) = 8 students

4. Finally, to find the percentage of students who like to play video games, we divide the number of students who like to play video games by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
   (8 / 160) * 100 = 5%

So, 5% of the students like to play video games.",5.0,1,"First, let's find out how many students like to bake. We know that the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football.

Question: A class of 160 students has various hobbies. 69 like to hike, 8 like to play chess, 13 like to swim, 13 like to play football, and the rest like to either play video games or bake. What percentage of the students like to play video games if the number of the students that like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football?
Your initial answer was: First, let's find out how many students like to bake. We know that the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football.

Number of students who like to play football = 13
Four times the number of students who like to play football = 4 * 13 = 52
Number of students who like to bake = 52 - 3 = 49

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who have hobbies other than playing video games:

Number of students who like to hike = 69
Number of students who like to play chess = 8
Number of students who like to swim = 13
Number of students who like to play football = 13
Number of students who like to bake = 49

Total number of students with these hobbies = 69 + 8 + 13 + 13 + 49 = 152

However, this total (152) exceeds the total number of students in the class (160), which means there's an inconsistency in the problem as presented. Let's re-evaluate the steps to ensure accuracy.

Let's re-calculate the total number of students with the given hobbies:

Total number of students with given hobbies = 69 (hiking) + 8 (chess) + 13 (swimming) + 13 (football) + 49 (baking) = 152

This total (152) is still greater than the total number of students in the class (160), indicating an error in the problem's setup. Therefore, we cannot accurately determine the percentage of students who like to play video games based on the given information.
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the total number of students with given hobbies could exceed the total number of students in the class, which led to an inconsistency. I misinterpreted the problem by not considering the overlap in hobbies.

Error Keywords:
- Assumption error
- Overlap error
- Misinterpretation
- Calculation error
Solution:
1. First, let's find out how many students like to bake.
   Number of students who like to play football = 13
   Four times the number of students who like to play football = 4 * 13 = 52
   Number of students who like to bake = 52 - 3 = 49

2. Calculate the total number of students with the given hobbies (excluding video games and considering overlaps):
   Number of students who like to hike = 69
   Number of students who like to play chess = 8
   Number of students who like to swim = 13
   Total number of students with these hobbies = 69 + 8 + 13 = 90

3. Subtract the number of students with given hobbies from the total number of students to find those who like playing video games:
   Total number of students = 160
   Number of students with given hobbies = 90
   Total number of students who like to bake or play video games = 160 - 69 - 8 -13 = 70

4. Subtract the number of students who like to bake from the total number of students who like to bake or play video games:
   Number of students who like to bake = 49
   Number of students who like to play video games = 70 - 49 = 21

5. Calculate the percentage of students who like to play video games:
   Percentage of students who like to play video games = (21 / 160) * 100 = 13.125%

The final answer is 13.125%

Question: A school has 200 students. 70 like to read, 30 like to draw, 25 like to play basketball, and the rest like to either sing or dance. What percentage of the students like to sing if the number of students that like to dance is 5 more than three times the number that prefer playing basketball?

Wrong answer: I calculated the number of students who like to dance as 5 more than three times the number that prefer playing basketball, which is 5 + 3*25 = 80. Then, I subtracted the number of students who like to read, draw, and play basketball from the total number of students to find the number of students who like to sing or dance, which is 200 - 70 - 30 - 25 = 75. Finally, I calculated the percentage of students who like to sing as (75 - 80) / 200 * 100% = -2.5%, which is not possible.

Now, look at this question:
Question: A class of 160 students has various hobbies. 69 like to hike, 8 like to play chess, 13 like to swim, 13 like to play football, and the rest like to either play video games or bake. What percentage of the students like to play video games if the number of the students that like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 160.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Reflection

**Explanation:**
I incorrectly calculated the number of students who like to bake and made an error in the final percentage calculation. I should have correctly interpreted the problem statement and set up the algebraic expressions accurately.

**Error Keywords:**
- Misinterpretation of the problem
- Incorrect algebraic setup
- Mistake in calculating percentages

### Solution

1. **Calculate the number of students who like to bake:**
   - The number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football.
   - Number of students who like to play football = 13
   - Therefore, the number of students who like to bake = 4 * 13 - 3 = 52 - 3 = 49

2. **Calculate the total number of students who like to hike, play chess, swim, and play football:**
   - Number of students who like to hike = 69
   - Number of students who like to play chess = 8
   - Number of students who like to swim = 13
   - Number of students who like to play football = 13
   - Total = 69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103

3. **Calculate the number of students who like to play video games or bake:**
   - Total number of students = 160
   - Number of students who like to hike, play chess, swim, and play football = 103
   - Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games or bake = 160 - 103 = 57

4. **Calculate the number of students who like to play video games:**
   - Number of students who like to bake = 49
   - Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games = 57 - 49 = 8

5. **Calculate the percentage of students who like to play video games:**
   - Percentage = (Number of students who like to play video games / Total number of students) * 100
   - Percentage = (8 / 160) * 100 = 5%

### Instructions

1. **Carefully read the problem statement** to understand the relationships between the different groups of students.
2. **Set up the algebraic expressions correctly** based on the given information.
3. **Calculate the number of students who like to bake** using the correct algebraic expression.
4. **Subtract the number of students who like to hike, play chess, swim, and play football from the total number of students** to find the number of students who like to play video games or bake.
5. **Calculate the number of students who like to play video games** by subtracting the number of students who like to bake from the total number of students who like to play video games or bake.
6. **Calculate the percentage of students who like to play video games** using the correct formula.

[Example Input]
Question: A school has 200 students. 70 like to read, 30 like to draw, 25 like to play basketball, and the rest like to either sing or dance. What percentage of the students like to sing if the number of students that like to dance is 5 more than three times the number that prefer playing basketball?

Wrong answer: I calculated the number of students who like to dance as 5 more than three times the number that prefer playing basketball, which is 5 + 3*25 = 80. Then, I subtracted the number of students who like to read, draw, and play basketball from the total number of students to find the number of students who like to sing or dance, which is 200 - 70 - 30 - 25 = 75. Finally, I calculated the percentage of students who like to sing as (75 - 80) / 200 * 100% = -2.5%, which is not possible. I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of students who like to dance and in the final percentage calculation.

   - Hotel cost for 2 days: 2 * ₣100 = ₣200
   - Food cost for 2 days: 2 * ₣20 = ₣40
   - Transportation cost for 2 days: 2 * ₣10 = ₣20
   - Total cost: ₣200 + ₣40 + ₣20 = ₣260

2. **Oliver's contribution:**
   - Oliver has ₣85.

3. **Friends' contribution:**
   - Friends will cover the cost of all the food, which is ₣40.

4. **Charity's contribution:**
   - The charity will cover 1/10 of the remaining cost after Oliver's and his friends' contributions.

Let's calculate the remaining cost after Oliver's and his friends' contributions:
- Remaining cost after Oliver's contribution: ₣260 - ₣85 = ₣175
- Remaining cost after friends' contribution: ₣175 - ₣40 = ₣135

Now, calculate the charity's contribution:
- Charity's contribution: 1/10 * ₣135 = ₣13.5

Finally, calculate the amount Oliver is still missing:
- Remaining cost after charity's contribution: ₣135 - ₣13.5 = ₣121.5

The answer is ₣121.5.

[Example Input]
Question: Emma is planning a 3-day trip. Each day costs $150 for accommodation, $30 for meals, and $15 for local transportation. Emma only has $200. Her family has agreed to cover the cost of all meals for the trip. Emma has also applied for a travel grant, which has decided to cover 1/5 of the remaining cost of the trip. How much money is Emma still missing?

Wrong answer: Emma is missing $225. I calculated the total cost for 3 days as $150 + $30 + $15 = $195 per day, which totals $585 for 3 days. Since her family covers the meals, the cost reduces to $150 + $15 = $165 per day, or $495 for 3 days. Emma's $200 plus the grant covering 1/5 of the remaining $295 leaves her with $200 + $59 = $259, so she is still missing $225.

Explanation:
I miscalculated the remaining cost after the family's contribution and incorrectly applied the grant percentage.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect application of percentages
- Budgeting errors
- Financial planning mistakes

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total cost for the trip without any contributions.
2. Subtract the cost covered by family or friends.
3. Determine the remaining cost.
4. Calculate the grant amount based on the remaining cost.
5. Subtract the grant amount from the remaining cost to find the final amount Emma is missing.

Advice:
- Always double-check calculations for each component of the cost.
- Ensure correct application of percentages for grants or contributions.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid errors in complex calculations.

Solution:
1. Total cost for 3 days: $150 + $30 + $15 = $195 per day, so $195 * 3 = $585.
2. Family covers meals: $585 - ($30 * 3) = $585 - $90 = $495.
3. Remaining cost after family's contribution: $495.
4. Grant covers 1/5 of the remaining cost: $495 * 1/5 = $99.
5. Emma's contribution: $200.
6. Final amount missing: $495 - $99 - $200 = $196.

Emma is still missing $196.

p2,gsm-symbolic,mistralai/mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501,"Elena and Jamal went to a construction supply store. Jamal is a member, but Elena is not. Elena has $98.39 and wants to buy 15 anchors from a bin at the store. She also needs 9 nails, each costing $0.61. Each anchor costs $0.26. Additionally, Elena picks up 10 gallons of paint. Jamal starts with $80 and wants 10 gallons of paint, each priced at $7.0, and 3 carpenter pencils, each costing $2. The store offers a 10% discount on paint for members. How much more money does Elena have left than Jamal after they leave the store?",8.0,"Let's calculate the total cost for Elena and Jamal separately.

**Elena's Purchases:**
1. Anchors: 15 anchors * $0.26 each = $3.90
2. Nails: 9 nails * $0.61 each = $5.49
3. Paint: 10 gallons * $7.00 each = $70.00 (since Elena is not a member, she does not get a discount)

Total cost for Elena = $3.90 + $5.49 + $70.00 = $79.39

Elena starts with $98.39, so after her purchases, she has:
$98.39 - $79.39 = $19.00 left.

**Jamal's Purchases:**
1. Paint: 10 gallons * $7.00 each = $70.00
   - Member discount: 10% of $70.00 = $7.00
   - Discounted paint cost: $70.00 - $7.00 = $63.00
2. Carpenter pencils: 3 pencils * $2.00 each = $6.00

Total cost for Jamal = $63.00 + $6.00 = $69.00

Jamal starts with $80.00, so after his purchases, he has:
$80.00 - $69.00 = $11.00 left.

**Comparison:**
Elena has $19.00 left, and Jamal has $11.00 left.

Elena has $19.00 - $11.00 = $8.00 more than Jamal after they leave the store.",8.0,1,"First, let's calculate how much Elena spends at the store.

Elena buys 15 anchors at $0.26 each:
15 anchors * $0.26 = $3.90

She also buys 9 nails at $0.61 each:
9 nails * $0.61 = $5.49

The cost of the anchors and nails together is:
$3.90 + $5.49 = $9.39

Since the problem doesn't specify the price per gallon of paint for non-members, we can only add the cost of the anchors and nails to Elena's spending. The price of paint for Elena is not given.

Now let's calculate how much Jamal spends at the store.

Jamal buys 10 gallons of paint at $7.00 each, but with a 10% discount:
10 gallons * $7.00 = $70.00

The discount on the paint is:
10% of $70.00 = 0.10 * $70.00 = $7.00

So, the discounted price for the paint is:
$70.00 - $7.00 = $63.00

Jamal also buys 3 carpenter pencils at $2.00 each:
3 pencils * $2.00 = $6.00

The total cost for Jamal is:
$63.00 (paint) + $6.00 (pencils) = $69.00

Now let's calculate how much money each person has left.

Elena starts with $98.39 and spends $9.39 on anchors and nails:
$98.39 - $9.39 = $89.00

Jamal starts with $80.00 and spends $69.00:
$80.00 - $69.00 = $11.00

Jamal starts with $80 and wants 10 gallons of paint, each priced at $7.0, and 3 carpenter pencils, each costing $2. The store offers a 10% discount on paint for members. How much more money does Elena have left than Jamal after they leave the store?",8.0,"Let's calculate the total cost for Elena and Jamal separately.

**Elena's Purchases:**
1. Anchors: 15 anchors * $0.26 each = $3.90
2. Nails: 9 nails * $0.61 each = $5.49
3. Paint: 10 gallons * $7.00 each = $70.00 (since Elena is not a member, she does not get a discount)

Total cost for Elena = $3.90 + $5.49 + $70.00 = $79.39

Elena starts with $98.39, so after her purchases, she has:
$98.39 - $79.39 = $19.00 left.

**Jamal's Purchases:**
1. Paint: 10 gallons * $7.00 each = $70.00
   - Member discount: 10% of $70.00 = $7.00
   - Discounted paint cost: $70.00 - $7.00 = $63.00
2. Carpenter pencils: 3 pencils * $2.00 each = $6.00

Total cost for Jamal = $63.00 + $6.00 = $69.00

Jamal starts with $80.00, so after his purchases, he has:
$80.00 - $69.00 = $11.00 left.

**Comparison:**
Elena has $19.00 left, and Jamal has $11.00 left.

Elena has $19.00 - $11.00 = $8.00 more than Jamal after they leave the store.",8.0,1,"First, let's calculate how much Elena spends at the store.

Elena buys 15 anchors at $0.26 each:
15 anchors * $0.26 = $3.90

She also buys 9 nails at $0.61 each:
9 nails * $0.61 = $5.49

The cost of the anchors and nails together is:
$3.90 + $5.49 = $9.39

Since the problem doesn't specify the price per gallon of paint for non-members, we can only add the cost of the anchors and nails to Elena's spending. The price of paint for Elena is not given.

Now let's calculate how much Jamal spends at the store.

Jamal buys 10 gallons of paint at $7.00 each, but with a 10% discount:
10 gallons * $7.00 = $70.00

The discount on the paint is:
10% of $70.00 = 0.10 * $70.00 = $7.00

So, the discounted price for the paint is:
$70.00 - $7.00 = $63.00

Jamal also buys 3 carpenter pencils at $2.00 each:
3 pencils * $2.00 = $6.00

The total cost for Jamal is:
$63.00 (paint) + $6.00 (pencils) = $69.00

Now, look at this question:
Question: Elena and Jamal went to a construction supply store. Jamal is a member, but Elena is not. Elena has $98.39 and wants to buy 15 anchors from a bin at the store. She also needs 9 nails, each costing $0.61. Each anchor costs $0.26. Additionally, Elena picks up 10 gallons of paint. Jamal starts with $80 and wants 10 gallons of paint, each priced at $7.0, and 3 carpenter pencils, each costing $2. The store offers a 10% discount on paint for members. How much more money does Elena have left than Jamal after they leave the store?
Your initial answer was: First, let's calculate how much Elena spends at the store.

Elena buys 15 anchors at $0.26 each:
15 anchors * $0.26 = $3.90

She also buys 9 nails at $0.61 each:
9 nails * $0.61 = $5.49

The cost of the anchors and nails together is:
$3.90 + $5.49 = $9.39

Since the problem doesn't specify the price per gallon of paint for non-members, we can only add the cost of the anchors and nails to Elena's spending. The price of paint for Elena is not given.

Now let's calculate how much Jamal spends at the store.

Jamal buys 10 gallons of paint at $7.00 each, but with a 10% discount:
10 gallons * $7.00 = $70.00

The discount on the paint is:
10% of $70.00 = 0.10 * $70.00 = $7.00

So, the discounted price for the paint is:
$70.00 - $7.00 = $63.00

Jamal also buys 3 carpenter pencils at $2.00 each:
3 pencils * $2.00 = $6.00

The total cost for Jamal is:
$63.00 (paint) + $6.00 (pencils) = $69.00

Now let's calculate how much money each person has left.

Elena starts with $98.39 and spends $9.39 on anchors and nails:
$98.39 - $9.39 = $89.00

Jamal starts with $80.00 and spends $69.00:
$80.00 - $69.00 = $11.00

Finally, let's find out how much more money Elena has left than Jamal:
$89.00 (Elena) - $11.00 (Jamal) = $78.00

The answer is $78.00.

","### Reflection

**Explanation:**
I incorrectly answered the question because I did not account for the cost of the paint for Elena. I assumed that the price of paint for non-members was not given, which led to an incomplete calculation of Elena's total spending. Additionally, I did not consider the cost of the paint for Jamal correctly, as I did not include the cost of the pencils in the final calculation.

**Error Keywords:**
- Omission error
- Calculation error
- Misinterpretation of problem constraints
- Incomplete problem solving

### Corrected Solution

1. **Calculate Elena's total spending:**
   - **Anchors:** 15 anchors * $0.26 each = $3.90
   - **Nails:** 9 nails * $0.61 each = $5.49
   - **Paint:** 10 gallons * $7.00 each (no discount for non-members) = $70.00
   - **Total for Elena:** $3.90 (anchors) + $5.49 (nails) + $70.00 (paint) = $79.39

2. **Calculate Jamal's total spending:**
   - **Paint:** 10 gallons * $7.00 each = $70.00
   - **Discount:** 10% of $70.00 = $7.00
   - **Discounted paint cost:** $70.00 - $7.00 = $63.00
   - **Carpenter pencils:** 3 pencils * $2.00 each = $6.00
   - **Total for Jamal:** $63.00 (paint) + $6.00 (pencils) = $69.00

3. **Calculate the remaining money for each person:**
   - **Elena:** $98.39 - $79.39 = $19.00
   - **Jamal:** $80.00 - $69.00 = $11.00

4. **Calculate the difference:**
   - **Difference:** $19.00 (Elena) - $11.00 (Jamal) = $8.00

Question: Alex and Jordan went to an electronics store. Alex is a member, but Jordan is not. Alex has $200 and wants to buy 5 smartphones, each costing $30, and 2 chargers, each costing $15. Jordan has $150 and wants to buy 3 smartphones, each costing $30, and 4 chargers, each costing $15. The store offers a 15% discount on smartphones for members. How much more money does Alex have left than Jordan after they leave the store?

Wrong answer: Alex has $50 more than Jordan. I calculated the total cost for Alex as $150 (5 smartphones * $30 each + 2 chargers * $15 each) and for Jordan as $135 (3 smartphones * $30 each + 4 chargers * $15 each). I did not apply the discount correctly for Alex, and I did not compare the remaining money accurately.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total cost for Alex by not applying the 15% discount on the smartphones correctly. I also did not accurately compare the remaining money for both Alex and Jordan.

Error Keywords:
- Arithmetic error
- Discount application error
- Comparison error

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total cost of items for each person before any discounts.
2. Apply the discount correctly for the member.
3. Subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money each person has to find the remaining money.
4. Compare the remaining money for both people to determine who has more left.

Advice:

- Ava can eat twice as much as Arash, so Ava can eat 5 * 2 = 10 pieces a day.
- DeShawn can eat twice as much as Ava, so DeShawn can eat 10 * 2 = 20 pieces a day.

For the first 2 days, they all eat at their initial rates. So, the total consumption for the first 2 days is:

- Arash: 5 pieces/day * 2 days = 10 pieces
- Ava: 10 pieces/day * 2 days = 20 pieces
- DeShawn: 20 pieces/day * 2 days = 40 pieces

Total consumption in the first 2 days = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 pieces

After 2 days, the cake has 120 - 70 = 50 pieces left.

Now, DeShawn cuts his consumption by half, so he will eat 20 / 2 = 10 pieces a day.

The new daily consumption rate for all three is:

- Arash: 5 pieces/day
- Ava: 10 pieces/day
- DeShawn: 10 pieces/day

Total daily consumption after the first 2 days = 5 + 10 + 10 = 25 pieces/day

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to eat the remaining 50 pieces at the rate of 25 pieces per day:

50 pieces / 25 pieces/day = 2 days

So, it will take an additional 2 days to finish the cake after the first 2 days.

Therefore, the total number of days to finish the cake is 2 (initial days) + 2 (additional days) = 4 days.",4.0,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Daily Consumption Rates:**
   - Arash eats 5 pieces per day.
   - Ava eats twice as much as Arash, so Ava eats 5 * 2 = 10 pieces per day.
   - DeShawn eats twice as much as Ava, so DeShawn eats 10 * 2 = 20 pieces per day.

   - Ava eats 10 pieces/day * 2 days = 20 pieces.
   - DeShawn eats 20 pieces/day * 2 days = 40 pieces.
   - Total eaten in 2 days = 10 (Arash) + 20 (Ava) + 40 (DeShawn) = 70 pieces.

3. **Remaining Pieces After 2 Days:**
   - Total pieces = 120.
   - Pieces eaten in 2 days = 70.
   - Remaining pieces = 120 - 70 = 50 pieces.

4. **DeShawn's Reduced Consumption:**
   - DeShawn cuts his consumption by half, so he now eats 20 / 2 = 10 pieces per day.

5. **Total Daily Consumption After DeShawn's Diet:**
   - Arash eats 5 pieces per day.
   - Ava eats 10 pieces per day.
   - DeShawn eats 10 pieces per day.
   - Total daily consumption = 5 (Arash) + 10 (Ava) + 10 (DeShawn) = 25 pieces per day.

6. **Days to Eat the Remaining Pieces:**
   - Remaining pieces = 50.
   - Daily consumption = 25 pieces.
   - Days needed = 50 / 25 = 2 days.

So, after 3 weeks, there will be 530 unoccupied rooms in the care facility.",530.0,1,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks, considering the initial occupancy and the rooms out of service.

1. **Calculate the number of occupied rooms initially:**
   The facility has 1900 rooms, and 1/4 of them are occupied.
   Occupied rooms = 1900 * (1/4) = 475 rooms.

2. **Calculate the number of rooms out of service:**
   1/4 of the rooms are out of service.
   Rooms out of service = 1900 * (1/4) = 475 rooms.

3. **Calculate the number of rooms available for new admissions:**
   Total rooms - Occupied rooms - Rooms out of service = 1900 - 475 - 475 = 950 rooms.

4. **Calculate the number of new admissions over 3 weeks:**
   20 patients are admitted each day.
   Days in 3 weeks = 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.
   Total new admissions = 20 patients/day * 21 days = 420 patients.

5. **Calculate the number of unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks:**
   Available rooms - New admissions = 950 - 420 = 530 rooms.

On Wednesday, he sold 27 boxes of muffin and 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie, than on Thursday. On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday and 21 boxes of apricot pie. On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?",796.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

First, let's find out how many boxes of each item Faisal sold on each day.

**Wednesday:**
- Muffins: 27 boxes
- Apricot pies: 27 - 13 = 14 boxes

**Thursday:**
- Muffins: 27 + 11 = 38 boxes
- Apricot pies: 21 boxes

**Friday:**
- Total boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday: (27 + 14) + (38 + 21) = 41 + 59 = 100 boxes
- Since he sold as much on Friday as he did in the past two days combined, he also sold 100 boxes on Friday.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day.

**Wednesday's earnings:**
- Muffins: 27 boxes * ₺9/box = ₺243
- Apricot pies: 14 boxes * ₺21/box = ₺294
- Total for Wednesday: ₺243 + ₺294 = ₺537

**Thursday's earnings:**
- Muffins: 38 boxes * ₺9/box = ₺342
- Apricot pies: 21 boxes * ₺21/box = ₺441
- Total for Thursday: ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783

**Friday's earnings:**
Since we don't know the breakdown of muffins and apricot pies for Friday, we'll assume he sold the same ratio as the total from Wednesday and Thursday. The total number of boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday is 100, with 59 muffins and 41 pies.

- Muffins on Friday: (59/100) * 100 boxes = 59 boxes
- Apricot pies on Friday: (41/100) * 100 boxes = 41 boxes

- Muffins: 59 boxes * ₺9/box = ₺531
- Apricot pies: 41 boxes * ₺21/box = ₺861

Question: Faisal is selling muffins and apricot pies for a fundraiser. On Wednesday, he sold 27 boxes of muffin and 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie, than on Thursday. On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday and 21 boxes of apricot pie. On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?
Your initial answer was: To find Faisal's average daily earning, we need to calculate the total earnings for each day and then find the average.

**Wednesday:**
- Muffins sold: 27 boxes
- Apricot pies sold: 27 - 13 = 14 boxes

**Thursday:**
- Muffins sold: 27 + 11 = 38 boxes
- Apricot pies sold: 21 boxes

**Friday:**
- Total boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday: (27 + 14) + (38 + 21) = 41 + 59 = 100 boxes
- Since Friday's sales are the same as the combined total of Wednesday and Thursday, Friday's sales are also 100 boxes.

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each day:

**Wednesday's earnings:**
- Muffins: 27 boxes * ₺9 = ₺243
- Apricot pies: 14 boxes * ₺21 = ₺294
- Total for Wednesday: ₺243 + ₺294 = ₺537

**Thursday's earnings:**
- Muffins: 38 boxes * ₺9 = ₺342
- Apricot pies: 21 boxes * ₺21 = ₺441
- Total for Thursday: ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783

**Friday's earnings:**
- Since the total number of boxes sold on Friday is the same as the combined total of Wednesday and Thursday, we can assume the earnings are also the same.
- Total for Friday: ₺537 + ₺783 = ₺1320

**Total earnings for the three days:**
- Total earnings: ₺537 (Wednesday) + ₺783 (Thursday) + ₺1320 (Friday) = ₺2640

**Average daily earning:**
- Average = Total earnings / Number of days
- Average = ₺2640 / 3 = ₺880

The answer is ₺880.

2. **Thursday's Sales:**
   - Muffins sold: 27 + 11 = 38 boxes
   - Apricot pies sold: 21 boxes

3. **Friday's Sales:**
   - Total boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday: (27 + 14) + (38 + 21) = 41 + 59 = 100 boxes
   - Since Friday's sales are the same as the combined total of Wednesday and Thursday, Friday's sales are also 100 boxes.

4. **Earnings Calculation:**
   - **Wednesday's Earnings:**
     - Muffins: 27 boxes * ₺9 = ₺243
     - Apricot pies: 14 boxes * ₺21 = ₺294

     - Apricot pies: 21 boxes * ₺21 = ₺441
     - Total for Thursday: ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783

   - **Friday's Earnings:**
     - We need to distribute the 100 boxes sold on Friday between muffins and apricot pies.
     - Let's assume the distribution is the same as the combined average of Wednesday and Thursday.
     - Total boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday: 100 boxes
     - Average boxes sold per day: 100 boxes / 2 days = 50 boxes per day
     - Muffins sold on Friday: 50 boxes
     - Apricot pies sold on Friday: 50 boxes
     - Earnings for Friday:
       - Muffins: 50 boxes * ₺9 = ₺450
       - Apricot pies: 50 boxes * ₺21 = ₺1050
       - Total for Friday: ₺450 + ₺1050 = ₺1500

5. **Total Earnings for the Three Days:**
   - Total earnings: ₺537 (Wednesday) + ₺783 (Thursday) + ₺1500 (Friday) = ₺2820

6. **Average Daily Earning:**
   - Average = Total earnings / Number of days
   - Average = ₺2820 / 3 = ₺940

**The answer is ₺940.**

Question: A bakery sold 15 loaves of bread and 8 fewer croissants than bread on Monday. On Tuesday, they sold 5 more loaves of bread than on Monday and 12 croissants. On Wednesday, they sold as much as they did in the past two days combined. If the bread cost $3 and the croissant cost $5, what was the bakery's average daily earning?
Wrong answer: I calculated the total earnings for each day and then divided by 3, but I forgot to account for the difference in the number of croissants sold on Monday and Tuesday. I got an average daily earning of $54.

On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?",796.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

First, let's find out how many boxes of each item Faisal sold on each day.

**Wednesday:**
- Muffins: 27 boxes
- Apricot pies: 27 - 13 = 14 boxes

**Thursday:**
- Muffins: 27 + 11 = 38 boxes
- Apricot pies: 21 boxes

**Friday:**
- Total boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday: (27 + 14) + (38 + 21) = 41 + 59 = 100 boxes
- Since he sold as much on Friday as he did in the past two days combined, he also sold 100 boxes on Friday.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day.

**Wednesday's earnings:**
- Muffins: 27 boxes * ₺9/box = ₺243
- Apricot pies: 14 boxes * ₺21/box = ₺294
- Total for Wednesday: ₺243 + ₺294 = ₺537

**Thursday's earnings:**
- Muffins: 38 boxes * ₺9/box = ₺342
- Apricot pies: 21 boxes * ₺21/box = ₺441
- Total for Thursday: ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783

**Friday's earnings:**
Since we don't know the breakdown of muffins and apricot pies for Friday, we'll assume he sold the same ratio as the total from Wednesday and Thursday. The total number of boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday is 100, with 59 muffins and 41 pies.

- Muffins on Friday: (59/100) * 100 boxes = 59 boxes
- Apricot pies on Friday: (41/100) * 100 boxes = 41 boxes

- Muffins: 59 boxes * ₺9/box = ₺531
- Apricot pies: 41 boxes * ₺21/box = ₺861
- Total for Friday: ₺531 + ₺861 = ₺1392

Now, let's find the total earnings for the three days and then the average daily earning.

Total earnings for the three days: ₺537 + ₺783 + ₺1392 = ₺2712

Average daily earning: Total earnings / 3 days = ₺2712 / 3 = ₺904

Faisal's average daily earning is ₺904.",904.0,0,"To find Faisal's average daily earning, we need to calculate the total earnings for each day and then find the average.

**Wednesday:**
- Muffins sold: 27 boxes
- Apricot pies sold: 27 - 13 = 14 boxes

**Thursday:**
- Muffins sold: 27 + 11 = 38 boxes
- Apricot pies sold: 21 boxes

**Friday:**
- Total boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday: (27 + 14) + (38 + 21) = 41 + 59 = 100 boxes
- Since Friday's sales are the same as the combined total of Wednesday and Thursday, Friday's sales are also 100 boxes.

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each day:

**Wednesday's earnings:**
- Muffins: 27 boxes * ₺9 = ₺243
- Apricot pies: 14 boxes * ₺21 = ₺294
- Total for Wednesday: ₺243 + ₺294 = ₺537

**Thursday's earnings:**
- Muffins: 38 boxes * ₺9 = ₺342
- Apricot pies: 21 boxes * ₺21 = ₺441
- Total for Thursday: ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783

**Friday's earnings:**
- Since the total number of boxes sold on Friday is the same as the combined total of Wednesday and Thursday, we can assume the earnings are also the same.
- Total for Friday: ₺537 + ₺783 = ₺1320

**Total earnings for the three days:**
- Total earnings: ₺537 (Wednesday) + ₺783 (Thursday) + ₺1320 (Friday) = ₺2640

**Average daily earning:**
- Average = Total earnings / Number of days
- Average = ₺2640 / 3 = ₺880

Question: Maria is selling cookies and brownies for a bake sale. On Monday, she sold 18 boxes of cookies and 9 fewer boxes of brownies than on Tuesday. On Tuesday, she sold 15 more boxes of cookies than on Monday and 16 boxes of brownies. On Wednesday, she sold as much as she did in the past two days combined. If the cookies cost $5 and the brownies cost $8, what was Maria's average daily earning?

Wrong answer: Maria sold 18 + 9 = 27 boxes of cookies on Monday. On Tuesday, she sold 18 + 15 = 33 boxes of cookies. The total number of boxes sold on Monday and Tuesday is 27 + 33 = 60. On Wednesday, she sold 60 boxes. The total number of boxes sold over the three days is 60 + 60 = 120. The total earnings are 120 * $5 = $600. The average daily earning is $600 / 3 = $200. (The mistake here is not accounting for the different prices of cookies and brownies, and not correctly calculating the total number of boxes sold each day.)

Correct answer: Maria sold 18 boxes of cookies on Monday and 18 - 9 = 9 boxes of brownies. On Tuesday, she sold 18 + 15 = 33 boxes of cookies and 16 boxes of brownies. On Wednesday, she sold 18 + 9 + 33 + 16 = 76 boxes in total. The total earnings are (18 + 33 + 76) * $5 + (9 + 16 + 76) * $8 = $1090. The average daily earning is $1090 / 3 = $363.33.

**Explanation:**
I incorrectly calculated the total number of boxes sold each day and did not account for the different prices of muffins and apricot pies. Additionally, I misinterpreted the phrase ""as much as he did in the past two days combined"" to mean the total number of boxes, rather than the total earnings.

### Solution:

1. **Calculate the number of boxes sold each day:**
   - **Wednesday:**
     - Muffins: 27 boxes
     - Apricot pies: 27 - 13 = 14 boxes
   - **Thursday:**
     - Muffins: 27 + 11 = 38 boxes
     - Apricot pies: 21 boxes
   - **Friday:**
     - Total earnings on Wednesday: (27 * ₺9) + (14 * ₺21) = ₺243 + ₺294 = ₺537
     - Total earnings on Thursday: (38 * ₺9) + (21 * ₺21) = ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783
     - Total earnings on Friday: ₺537 + ₺783 = ₺1320

2. **Calculate the total earnings over the three days:**
   - Total earnings: ₺537 (Wednesday) + ₺783 (Thursday) + ₺1320 (Friday) = ₺2640

3. **Calculate the average daily earning:**
   - Average daily earning: ₺2640 / 3 = ₺880

### Instructions:

1. Identify the number of boxes sold each day for both items.
2. Calculate the total earnings for each day by multiplying the number of boxes sold by their respective prices.
3. Sum the total earnings for each day to find the total earnings over the three days.
4. Divide the total earnings by the number of days to find the average daily earning.

[Example Input]

Question: Maria is selling cookies and brownies for a bake sale. On Monday, she sold 18 boxes of cookies and 9 fewer boxes of brownies than on Tuesday. On Tuesday, she sold 15 more boxes of cookies than on Monday and 16 boxes of brownies. On Wednesday, she sold as much as she did in the past two days combined. If the cookies cost $5 and the brownies cost $8, what was Maria's average daily earning?

Wrong answer: Maria sold 18 + 9 = 27 boxes of cookies on Monday. On Tuesday, she sold 18 + 15 = 33 boxes of cookies. The total number of boxes sold on Monday and Tuesday is 27 + 33 = 60. On Wednesday, she sold 60 boxes. The total number of boxes sold over the three days is 60 + 60 = 120. The total earnings are 120 * $5 = $600. The average daily earning is $600 / 3 = $200. (The mistake here is not accounting for the different prices of cookies and brownies, and not correctly calculating the total number of boxes sold each day.)

Correct answer: Maria sold 18 boxes of cookies on Monday and 18 - 9 = 9 boxes of brownies. On Tuesday, she sold 18 + 15 = 33 boxes of cookies and 16 boxes of brownies. On Wednesday, she sold 18 + 9 + 33 + 16 = 76 boxes in total. The total earnings are (18 + 33 + 76) * $5 + (9 + 16 + 76) * $8 = $1090. The average daily earning is $1090 / 3 = $363.33.

Olga's flowers grow 3meters wide so she needs to leave 12 meters between every plant (including the plants width). Olga already owns 7 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ₣9 at the store. However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",31.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many plants Olga needs to fill her flower bed and then calculate the cost based on the given conditions.

### Step 1: Determine the number of plants needed

Olga's flower bed is 132 meters long. Each plant, including the space between them, requires 12 meters (3 meters for the plant width + 9 meters for the space between plants).

To find out how many plants Olga needs, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:

\[ \text{Number of plants} = \frac{\text{Total length of flower bed}}{\text{Space per plant}} = \frac{132 \text{ meters}}{12 \text{ meters}} = 11 \]

So, Olga needs 11 plants to fill her flower bed.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of plants to buy

Olga already owns 7 plants. Therefore, she needs to buy:

\[ \text{Plants to buy} = \text{Total plants needed} - \text{Plants already owned} = 11 - 7 = 4 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost

Each plant costs ₣9. If Olga buys more than 2 plants, she receives a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase.

Since Olga is buying 4 plants, she qualifies for the discount.

The cost without the discount would be:

\[ \text{Cost without discount} = 4 \text{ plants} \times ₣9 \text{ per plant} = ₣36 \]

The discount is ₣5, so the total cost with the discount is:

\[ \text{Total cost with discount} = ₣36 - ₣5 = ₣31 \]

Olga will spend ₣31 at the store to fill up her flower bed.",31.0,1,"To solve this, we need to determine how many plants Olga needs to fill her flower bed and then calculate the cost.

1. **Determine the space each plant requires:**

Question: Olga has a flower bed that is 132 meters long. Olga wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Olga's flowers grow 3meters wide so she needs to leave 12 meters between every plant (including the plants width). Olga already owns 7 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ₣9 at the store. However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?
Your initial answer was: To solve this, we need to determine how many plants Olga needs to fill her flower bed and then calculate the cost.

1. **Determine the space each plant requires:**
   Each plant requires 3 meters for itself and 12 meters of space between plants.
   So, each plant effectively takes up 3 + 12 = 15 meters of space.

2. **Calculate the number of plants needed:**
   The flower bed is 132 meters long.
   To find out how many plants Olga needs, we divide the length of the flower bed by the space each plant requires:
   132 meters / 15 meters per plant = 8.8
   Since Olga can't plant a fraction of a plant, she needs 9 plants to cover the entire length of the flower bed.

3. **Calculate the number of plants Olga needs to buy:**
   Olga already owns 7 flowers.
   So, the number of plants she needs to buy is 9 (total needed) - 7 (already owned) = 2 plants.

4. **Calculate the cost:**
   Each plant costs ₣9.
   Since Olga is buying 2 plants, she does not qualify for the ₣5 discount.
   So, the total cost is 2 plants * ₣9 per plant = ₣18.

The answer is ₣18.

1. **Determine the space each plant requires:**
   Each plant requires 3 meters for itself and 12 meters of space between plants.
   So, each plant effectively takes up 3 + 12 = 15 meters of space.

2. **Calculate the number of plants needed:**
   The flower bed is 132 meters long.
   To find out how many plants Olga needs, we divide the length of the flower bed by the space each plant requires:
   132 meters / 15 meters per plant = 8.8
   Since Olga can't plant a fraction of a plant, she needs 9 plants to cover the entire length of the flower bed.

3. **Calculate the number of plants Olga needs to buy:**
   Olga already owns 7 flowers.
   So, the number of plants she needs to buy is 9 (total needed) - 7 (already owned) = 2 plants.

4. **Calculate the cost:**
   Each plant costs ₣9.
   Since Olga is buying 2 plants, she does not qualify for the ₣5 discount.
   So, the total cost is 2 plants * ₣9 per plant = ₣18.

### Instructions for Future Problems

1. **Read the problem carefully** to understand all requirements and constraints.
2. **Identify the key variables** and their relationships.
3. **Calculate the space each plant requires** by adding the plant's width and the space between plants.
4. **Determine the total number of plants needed** by dividing the length of the flower bed by the space each plant requires.
5. **Round up** the number of plants if the result is a fraction, as you can't plant a fraction of a plant.
6. **Calculate the number of plants to buy** by subtracting the number of plants already owned from the total number of plants needed.
7. **Apply the discount rule correctly**:
   - If the number of plants to buy is more than 2, apply the ₣5 discount.
   - If the number of plants to buy is 2 or fewer, do not apply the discount.
8. **Calculate the total cost** by multiplying the number of plants to buy by the cost per plant and subtracting the discount if applicable.
9. **Double-check your calculations** to ensure accuracy.
10. **Choose the answer** that matches your calculated result.

p2,gsm-symbolic,mistralai/mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501,"Olga has a flower bed that is 132 meters long. Olga wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Olga's flowers grow 3meters wide so she needs to leave 12 meters between every plant (including the plants width). Olga already owns 7 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ₣9 at the store. However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",31.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many plants Olga needs to fill her flower bed and then calculate the cost based on the given conditions.

### Step 1: Determine the number of plants needed

Olga's flower bed is 132 meters long. Each plant, including the space between them, requires 12 meters (3 meters for the plant width + 9 meters for the space between plants).

To find out how many plants Olga needs, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:

\[ \text{Number of plants} = \frac{\text{Total length of flower bed}}{\text{Space per plant}} = \frac{132 \text{ meters}}{12 \text{ meters}} = 11 \]

So, Olga needs 11 plants to fill her flower bed.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of plants to buy

Olga already owns 7 plants. Therefore, she needs to buy:

\[ \text{Plants to buy} = \text{Total plants needed} - \text{Plants already owned} = 11 - 7 = 4 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost

Each plant costs ₣9. If Olga buys more than 2 plants, she receives a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase.

Since Olga is buying 4 plants, she qualifies for the discount.

The cost without the discount would be:

\[ \text{Cost without discount} = 4 \text{ plants} \times ₣9 \text{ per plant} = ₣36 \]

The discount is ₣5, so the total cost with the discount is:

\[ \text{Total cost with discount} = ₣36 - ₣5 = ₣31 \]

Olga will spend ₣31 at the store to fill up her flower bed.",31.0,1,"To solve this, we need to determine how many plants Olga needs to fill her flower bed and then calculate the cost.

Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.

For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below):

[Example Input]
Question: Maria wants to plant a row of trees along a fence that is 200 meters long. Each tree requires 5 meters of space, including the tree's width and the space between trees. Maria already has 5 trees. Each tree costs ₣15 at the store, but if she buys more than 3 trees, she gets a ₣10 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Maria spend at the store?
Wrong answer: First, I calculated the number of trees needed by dividing the length of the fence by the space required per tree (200 / 5 = 40 trees). Then, I subtracted the trees Maria already has (40 - 5 = 35 trees). Since Maria is buying more than 3 trees, she gets a ₣10 discount. So, the total cost would be (35 * ₣15) - ₣10 = ₣515.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of trees needed by not accounting for the fact that the first tree starts at the beginning of the fence, so the space required for the last tree is not needed. I also incorrectly applied the discount before subtracting the trees Maria already has.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect application of discount
- Misinterpretation of problem constraints

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total space required for the trees, including the space between them.
2. Determine the number of trees that can fit in the total space.
3. Subtract the number of trees Maria already has.
4. Calculate the cost of the trees needed.
5. Apply the discount if the number of trees to be bought is more than 3.

Advice:
- Always read the problem carefully to understand the constraints and requirements.
- Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with discounts and multiple steps.
- Be mindful of the order of operations and the correct application of discounts.

Solution:
First, calculate the total space required for the trees, including the space between them: 200 meters.
Since each tree requires 5 meters of space, the number of trees that can fit is (200 / 5) = 40 trees.
However, since the first tree starts at the beginning of the fence, we need to account for the space for the last tree, so the actual number of trees needed is 40 - 1 = 39 trees.
Maria already has 5 trees, so she needs to buy (39 - 5) = 34 trees.
The cost of 34 trees is (34 * ₣15) = ₣510.
Since Maria is buying more than 3 trees, she gets a ₣10 discount.
So, the total cost is ₣510 - ₣10 = ₣500.

I incorrectly calculated the number of plants needed by not accounting for the space required between the plants and the width of the plants. I also misapplied the discount by not considering the correct number of plants to purchase after accounting for the plants Olga already has.

**Error Keywords:**
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect application of discount
- Misinterpretation of problem constraints
- Incorrect total value calculation

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them:**
   Each plant requires 3 meters of space for the plant itself and 12 meters of space between each plant, making a total of 15 meters per plant.

2. **Determine the number of plants that can fit in the total space:**
   The length of the flower bed is 132 meters. Therefore, the number of plants that can fit is:
   \[
   \frac{132}{15} = 8.8
   \]
   Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 8 plants.

3. **Subtract the number of plants Olga already has:**
   Olga already has 7 plants, so she needs to buy:
   \[
   8 - 7 = 1 \text{ plant}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the plants needed:**
   The cost of 1 plant is:
   \[
   1 \times ₣9 = ₣9
   \]

5. **Apply the discount if the number of plants to be bought is more than 2:**
   Since Olga is buying only 1 plant, she does not receive the ₣5 discount.

Olga's flower bed is 132 meters long. Each plant, including the space between them, requires 12 meters (3 meters for the plant width + 9 meters for the space between plants).

To find out how many plants Olga needs, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:

\[ \text{Plants to buy} = \text{Total plants needed} - \text{Plants already owned} = 11 - 7 = 4 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost

Each plant costs ₣9. If Olga buys more than 2 plants, she receives a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase.

Since Olga is buying 4 plants, she qualifies for the discount.

The cost without the discount would be:

\[ \text{Cost without discount} = 4 \text{ plants} \times ₣9 \text{ per plant} = ₣36 \]

The discount is ₣5, so the total cost with the discount is:

\[ \text{Total cost with discount} = ₣36 - ₣5 = ₣31 \]

### Conclusion

Olga will spend ₣31 at the store to fill up her flower bed.",31.0,1,"To solve this, we need to determine how many plants Olga needs to fill her flower bed and then calculate the cost.

1. **Determine the space each plant requires:**
   Each plant requires 3 meters for itself and 12 meters of space between plants.
   So, each plant effectively takes up 3 + 12 = 15 meters of space.

2. **Calculate the number of plants needed:**
   The flower bed is 132 meters long.
   To find out how many plants Olga needs, we divide the length of the flower bed by the space each plant requires:
   132 meters / 15 meters per plant = 8.8
   Since Olga can't plant a fraction of a plant, she needs 9 plants to cover the entire length of the flower bed.

3. **Calculate the number of plants Olga needs to buy:**
   Olga already owns 7 flowers.
   So, the number of plants she needs to buy is 9 (total needed) - 7 (already owned) = 2 plants.

4. **Calculate the cost:**
   Each plant costs ₣9.
   Since Olga is buying 2 plants, she does not qualify for the ₣5 discount.
   So, the total cost is 2 plants * ₣9 per plant = ₣18.

The answer is ₣18.",18.0,0,3.0,0.0,18.0,"--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

[Example Input]
Question: Maria has a garden that is 150 meters long. Maria wants to fill her garden with trees. Maria's trees grow 4 meters wide so she needs to leave 14 meters between every tree (including the trees width). Maria already owns 5 trees. Each tree costs ₣12 at the store. However, if she buys more than 3 trees, she'll receive a ₣7 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Maria spend at the store to fill up her garden?

Wrong answer: Maria needs to plant 11 trees to fill the garden. She already has 5, so she needs to buy 6 more. The cost without discount is 6 * ₣12 = ₣72. Since she is buying more than 3 trees, she gets a ₣7 discount. So, the total cost is ₣72 - ₣7 = ₣65. However, this answer is incorrect because it does not account for the width of the trees and the space between them correctly.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of trees needed by not accounting for the width of the trees and the space between them correctly. I should have considered the total space each tree occupies (4 meters for the tree + 14 meters for the space = 18 meters per tree).

Error Keywords:
- Arithmetic error
- Misinterpretation of spacing requirements
- Incorrect application of discount rules

Instructions:
1. Determine the total space required for each tree, including the space between them.
2. Calculate the number of trees needed by dividing the total length of the garden by the total space required per tree.
3. Round up to the nearest whole number if necessary, as you cannot plant a fraction of a tree.
4. Subtract the number of trees Maria already owns from the total number of trees needed.
5. Calculate the cost of the additional trees needed.
6. Apply the discount if the number of trees to be bought exceeds the discount threshold.
7. Calculate the total cost.

Advice:
- Always double-check the spacing requirements and the total space each plant or tree will occupy.
- Be careful with rounding when calculating the number of plants or trees needed.
- Ensure you correctly apply any discounts based on the number of items purchased.

Solution:
1. Total space per tree = 4 meters (tree width) + 14 meters (space) = 18 meters.
2. Number of trees needed = 150 meters / 18 meters per tree = 8.33. Round up to 9 trees.
3. Maria already has 5 trees, so she needs to buy 9 - 5 = 4 more trees.
4. Cost without discount = 4 trees * ₣12 per tree = ₣48.
5. Since Maria is buying more than 3 trees, she gets a ₣7 discount.
6. Total cost = ₣48 - ₣7 = ₣41.

Maria will spend ₣41 at the store to fill up her garden.

**First Month:**
1. The uncle eats 10 pizzas per day.
2. The spouse eats 20 pizzas per day.
3. Together, they eat 10 + 20 = 30 pizzas per day.
4. The grandchild eats two-fourths of the combined number of pizzas, which is (2/4) * 30 = 15 pizzas per day.
5. The total number of pizzas eaten per day by the family is 30 (uncle and spouse) + 15 (grandchild) = 45 pizzas.

**Second Month (Diet):**
1. For the first half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by 60%. So they eat 40% of 45 pizzas per day.
2. 40% of 45 pizzas is 0.40 * 45 = 18 pizzas per day.

5. 50% of 18 pizzas is 0.50 * 18 = 9 pizzas per day.
6. In the second half of the month, they eat 9 pizzas/day * 15 days = 135 pizzas.

3. The grandchild eats two-fourths (which is the same as one-half) of the combined number of pizzas eaten by the uncle and spouse per day.

First, calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by the uncle and spouse per day:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \text{ pizzas per day} \]

Next, calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the grandchild per day:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ pizzas per day} \]

Now, calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by the family per day:
\[ 30 + 15 = 45 \text{ pizzas per day} \]

For the first half of the month, the total number of pizzas eaten is:
\[ 18 \times 15 = 270 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, calculate the number of pizzas eaten per day after an additional 50% reduction (which is 90% reduction from the original amount):
\[ 45 \times (1 - 0.90) = 45 \times 0.10 = 4.5 \text{ pizzas per day} \]

For the second half of the month, the total number of pizzas eaten is:
\[ 4.5 \times 15 = 67.5 \text{ pizzas} \]

Question: An uncle eats 10 pizzas per day, his spouse eats 20 pizzas per day, and their grandchild eats two-fourths of the combined number of pizzas they eat per day. After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 50% for the second half. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?
Your initial answer was: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by the family in two months, considering the changes in their diet.

**Month 1:**
1. The uncle eats 10 pizzas per day.
2. The spouse eats 20 pizzas per day.
3. The grandchild eats two-fourths (which is the same as one-half) of the combined number of pizzas eaten by the uncle and spouse per day.

First, calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by the uncle and spouse per day:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \text{ pizzas per day} \]

Next, calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the grandchild per day:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ pizzas per day} \]

Now, calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by the family per day:
\[ 30 + 15 = 45 \text{ pizzas per day} \]

Since there are 30 days in a month, the total number of pizzas eaten in the first month is:
\[ 45 \times 30 = 1350 \text{ pizzas} \]

**Month 2 (Diet Phase):**
1. For the first half of the month (15 days), the family reduces their food consumption by 60%.
2. For the second half of the month (15 days), the family reduces their food consumption by an additional 50%.

First, calculate the number of pizzas eaten per day after a 60% reduction:
\[ 45 \times (1 - 0.60) = 45 \times 0.40 = 18 \text{ pizzas per day} \]

For the first half of the month, the total number of pizzas eaten is:
\[ 18 \times 15 = 270 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, calculate the number of pizzas eaten per day after an additional 50% reduction (which is 90% reduction from the original amount):
\[ 45 \times (1 - 0.90) = 45 \times 0.10 = 4.5 \text{ pizzas per day} \]

For the second half of the month, the total number of pizzas eaten is:
\[ 4.5 \times 15 = 67.5 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, calculate the total number of pizzas eaten in the second month:
\[ 270 + 67.5 = 337.5 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, calculate the total number of pizzas eaten in two months:
\[ 1350 + 337.5 = 1687.5 \text{ pizzas} \]

Since the family cannot eat half a pizza, we should round to the nearest whole number. However, the problem does not specify how to handle fractions of pizzas, so we will keep the exact value.

The answer is 1687.5 pizzas.

","### Reflection

**Explanation:**
I incorrectly calculated the total number of pizzas eaten in the second month. Specifically, I misinterpreted the additional 50% reduction as a 90% reduction from the original amount, rather than a 50% reduction from the already reduced amount. This led to an incorrect calculation for the second half of the second month.

**Error Keywords:**
- Calculation error
- Misinterpretation of percentage reduction
- Arithmetic error
- Multiplication error
- Incorrect application of sequential reductions

### Corrected Solution

**Month 1:**
1. The uncle eats 10 pizzas per day.
2. The spouse eats 20 pizzas per day.
3. The grandchild eats two-fourths (which is the same as one-half) of the combined number of pizzas eaten by the uncle and spouse per day.

First, calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by the uncle and spouse per day:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \text{ pizzas per day} \]

Next, calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the grandchild per day:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ pizzas per day} \]

Now, calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by the family per day:
\[ 30 + 15 = 45 \text{ pizzas per day} \]

Since there are 30 days in a month, the total number of pizzas eaten in the first month is:
\[ 45 \times 30 = 1350 \text{ pizzas} \]

**Month 2 (Diet Phase):**
1. For the first half of the month (15 days), the family reduces their food consumption by 60%.
2. For the second half of the month (15 days), the family reduces their food consumption by an additional 50%.

First, calculate the number of pizzas eaten per day after a 60% reduction:
\[ 45 \times (1 - 0.60) = 45 \times 0.40 = 18 \text{ pizzas per day} \]

For the first half of the month, the total number of pizzas eaten is:
\[ 18 \times 15 = 270 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, calculate the number of pizzas eaten per day after an additional 50% reduction from the already reduced amount:
\[ 18 \times (1 - 0.50) = 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \text{ pizzas per day} \]

For the second half of the month, the total number of pizzas eaten is:
\[ 9 \times 15 = 135 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, calculate the total number of pizzas eaten in the second month:
\[ 270 + 135 = 405 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, calculate the total number of pizzas eaten in two months:
\[ 1350 + 405 = 1755 \text{ pizzas} \]

The answer is 1755 pizzas.

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 50% for the second half. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?",1755.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**First Month:**
1. The uncle eats 10 pizzas per day.
2. The spouse eats 20 pizzas per day.
3. Together, they eat 10 + 20 = 30 pizzas per day.
4. The grandchild eats two-fourths of the combined number of pizzas, which is (2/4) * 30 = 15 pizzas per day.
5. The total number of pizzas eaten per day by the family is 30 (uncle and spouse) + 15 (grandchild) = 45 pizzas.
6. In one month (assuming 30 days), the family eats 45 pizzas/day * 30 days = 1350 pizzas.

**Second Month (Diet):**
1. For the first half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by 60%. So they eat 40% of 45 pizzas per day.
2. 40% of 45 pizzas is 0.40 * 45 = 18 pizzas per day.
3. In the first half of the month, they eat 18 pizzas/day * 15 days = 270 pizzas.
4. For the second half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by an additional 50%.
5. 50% of 18 pizzas is 0.50 * 18 = 9 pizzas per day.
6. In the second half of the month, they eat 9 pizzas/day * 15 days = 135 pizzas.

**Total for Two Months:**
1. First month: 1350 pizzas.
2. Second month: 270 pizzas (first half) + 135 pizzas (second half) = 405 pizzas.
3. Total for two months: 1350 pizzas (first month) + 405 pizzas (second month) = 1755 pizzas.",1755.0,1,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by the family in two months, considering the changes in their diet.

3. The grandchild eats two-fourths (which is the same as one-half) of the combined number of pizzas eaten by the uncle and spouse per day.

First, calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by the uncle and spouse per day:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \text{ pizzas per day} \]

Next, calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the grandchild per day:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ pizzas per day} \]

Now, calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by the family per day:

Since there are 30 days in a month, the total number of pizzas eaten in the first month is:
\[ 45 \times 30 = 1350 \text{ pizzas} \]

**Month 2 (Diet Phase):**
1. For the first half of the month (15 days), the family reduces their food consumption by 60%.
2. For the second half of the month (15 days), the family reduces their food consumption by an additional 50%.

First, calculate the number of pizzas eaten per day after a 60% reduction:

For the first half of the month, the total number of pizzas eaten is:
\[ 18 \times 15 = 270 \text{ pizzas} \]

\[ 45 \times (1 - 0.90) = 45 \times 0.10 = 4.5 \text{ pizzas per day} \]

For the second half of the month, the total number of pizzas eaten is:
\[ 4.5 \times 15 = 67.5 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, calculate the total number of pizzas eaten in the second month:
\[ 270 + 67.5 = 337.5 \text{ pizzas} \]

[Example Input]

Question: A family consists of a parent who eats 15 burgers per day, a sibling who eats 25 burgers per day, and a pet who eats one-third of the combined number of burgers they eat per day. After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by 40% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 30% for the second half. How many burgers does this family eat in two months?

Wrong answer: The family eats 1,800 burgers in two months. I calculated the daily consumption incorrectly by not accounting for the pet's consumption based on the combined total of the parent and sibling. I also miscalculated the reduction in consumption during the diet period.

[Example Output]

Explanation:
I miscalculated the daily consumption by not correctly accounting for the pet's consumption based on the combined total of the parent and sibling. Additionally, I incorrectly applied the percentage reductions for the diet period.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation of combined consumption
- Incorrect application of percentage reductions
- Overlooking the dependency of the pet's consumption on the combined total

Instructions:
1. Calculate the daily consumption of the parent and sibling.
2. Determine the pet's daily consumption based on the combined total of the parent and sibling.
3. Calculate the total daily consumption for the family.
4. Calculate the total consumption for the first month.
5. Apply the 40% reduction for the first half of the second month.
6. Apply the additional 30% reduction for the second half of the second month.
7. Sum the total consumption for both months.

Advice:

Solution:
1. Parent's daily consumption: 15 burgers
2. Sibling's daily consumption: 25 burgers
3. Combined daily consumption of parent and sibling: 15 + 25 = 40 burgers
4. Pet's daily consumption: 1/3 of 40 = 13.33 burgers (rounded to two decimal places)
5. Total daily consumption for the family: 40 + 13.33 = 53.33 burgers
6. Total consumption for the first month (30 days): 53.33 * 30 = 1,599.9 burgers
7. First half of the second month (15 days) with 40% reduction: 53.33 * 0.6 * 15 = 479.98 burgers
8. Second half of the second month (15 days) with additional 30% reduction: 53.33 * 0.6 * 0.7 * 15 = 335.986 burgers

1. **Calculate the number of emails that don't require a response:**
   - Mohammed receives 30 emails a day.
   - 20% of these emails don't require any response.
   - So, the number of emails that don't require a response is 20% of 30.
   - 20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6 emails.

2. **Calculate the number of emails that require a response:**
   - Total emails = 30
   - Emails that don't require a response = 6
   - So, the number of emails that require a response is 30 - 6 = 24 emails.

3. **Calculate the number of emails Mohammed can respond to on a normal day:**
   - Mohammed can respond to 2 less than half of the emails that require a response.
   - Half of 24 is 24 / 2 = 12.
   - So, Mohammed can respond to 12 - 2 = 10 emails on a normal day.

4. **Calculate the number of emails Mohammed responds to in a 5-day work week:**
   - On a normal day, Mohammed responds to 10 emails.
   - In a 5-day work week, he responds to 10 * 5 = 50 emails.

5. **Calculate the number of emails Mohammed responds to on the overtime day:**
   - On the overtime day, he responds to 10% more emails than usual.
   - 10% of 10 is 0.10 * 10 = 1.
   - So, on the overtime day, he responds to 10 + 1 = 11 emails.

On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?",85.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Calculate Ananya's original speed on the beach and sidewalk:**

   Let \( v_b \) be Ananya's original speed on the beach in miles per hour. Then her original speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v_b \).

2. **Determine the time spent on the beach:**

   Ananya walks 10 miles on the beach. Given that she spends 50 minutes on the beach, we can convert 50 minutes to hours:
   \[
   50 \text{ minutes} = \frac{50}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{5}{6} \text{ hours}
   \]

   Therefore, her original speed on the beach \( v_b \) can be calculated as:
   \[
   v_b = \frac{10 \text{ miles}}{\frac{5}{6} \text{ hours}} = 10 \times \frac{6}{5} = 12 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

3. **Calculate the original speed on the sidewalk:**

   Since her original speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v_b \):
   \[
   2v_b = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

4. **Adjust for the injury:**

   Due to the injury, her speed on the beach is halved:
   \[
   \text{New speed on the beach} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

   Similarly, her speed on the sidewalk is also halved:
   \[
   \text{New speed on the sidewalk} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

5. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**

   Ananya walks 14 miles on the sidewalk. Using her new speed on the sidewalk:
   \[
   \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{14 \text{ miles}}{12 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{14}{12} \text{ hours} = \frac{7}{6} \text{ hours}
   \]

   Convert this time to minutes:
   \[
   \frac{7}{6} \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 70 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**

   The total time is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 50 \text{ minutes (beach)} + 70 \text{ minutes (sidewalk)} = 120 \text{ minutes}

The first 2 have 100 apartments each and the last one is 35% bigger than the other 2 combined. However, this week, 9 apartments from each of the first 2 complexes were vacant and did not require collection service. Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each place and he gets paid ₣0.5 per collection for each apartment. He also earns an additional 10% in tips. How much money does he make in a week?",1243.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

First, let's find out the total number of apartments in the third complex.

The first two complexes have 100 apartments each, so combined they have:
100 + 100 = 200 apartments

The third complex is 35% bigger than the other two combined, so:
35% of 200 = 0.35 * 200 = 70

So, the third complex has:
200 + 70 = 270 apartments

Now, let's find out the total number of apartments that Oscar collects garbage from.

From the first two complexes, 9 apartments each are vacant, so:
100 - 9 = 91 apartments per complex

Since there are two complexes with 91 apartments each:
91 * 2 = 182 apartments

Adding the third complex:
182 + 270 = 452 apartments

Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week, so:
452 apartments * 5 collections = 2260 collections per week

Oscar gets paid ₣0.5 per collection, so:
2260 collections * ₣0.5 = ₣1130

Now, let's calculate the additional 10% in tips:
10% of ₣1130 = 0.10 * ₣1130 = ₣113

Adding the tips to the base pay:
₣1130 + ₣113 = ₣1243

Therefore, Oscar makes ₣1243 in a week.",1243.0,1,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:**
   - Each of the first two complexes has 100 apartments.
   - Total apartments in the first two complexes = 100 + 100 = 200 apartments.

2. **Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex:**
   - The third complex is 35% bigger than the first two combined.
   - Increase in apartments = 35% of 200 = 0.35 * 200 = 70 apartments.

   - Total apartments = 200 (first two complexes) + 270 (third complex) = 470 apartments.

4. **Calculate the number of apartments that require collection service:**
   - 9 apartments from each of the first two complexes were vacant.
   - Vacant apartments = 9 + 9 = 18 apartments.
   - Apartments requiring service = 470 - 18 = 452 apartments.

1. ₺0.8 per minute for the first 10 minutes
2. ₺0.7 per minute from 10 to 40 minutes
3. ₺0.1 per 2 minutes (which is ₺0.05 per minute) after 40 minutes

Let's calculate the cost for each segment:

1. Cost for the first 10 minutes:
   10 minutes * ₺0.8/minute = ₺8

2. Cost from 10 to 40 minutes (30 minutes):
   30 minutes * ₺0.7/minute = ₺21

3. Cost from 40 to 60 minutes (20 minutes):
   20 minutes / 2 = 10 intervals of 2 minutes
   10 intervals * ₺0.1/interval = ₺1

Now, let's add up the costs for each segment to get the total cost before any discount:
Total cost = ₺8 + ₺21 + ₺1 = ₺30

Since the total bill is more than ₺25, a 20% discount is applied:
Discount amount = 20% of ₺30 = 0.20 * ₺30 = ₺6

Finally, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost:
Final cost = ₺30 - ₺6 = ₺24

1. **Calculate the new time it takes to clean one room:**
   Since the janitor is now slower and it takes them twice as long, the new time per room is:
   6 minutes/room * 2 = 12 minutes/room

2. **Calculate the total time needed to clean all rooms:**

   Keisha's age is 20 years, and the average age is 38 years. Therefore, Keisha is:
   \[
   38 - 20 = 18 \text{ years younger}
   \]

So, Keisha is 18 years younger than the average age of all three.",18.0,1,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Olivia, Bodhi, and Keisha, and then find out how much younger Keisha is than the average age of all three.

1. **Determine Olivia's current age:**
   Olivia will be 42 years old in 7 years. Therefore, her current age is:
   42 - 7 = 35 years.

2. **Determine Bodhi's current age:**
   Olivia and Bodhi are 24 years apart in age. Since Olivia is younger, Bodhi's current age is:
   35 + 24 = 59 years.

3. **Determine Keisha's current age:**
   Olivia and Keisha are 15 years apart in age. Since Olivia is older, Keisha's current age is:
   35 - 15 = 20 years.

4. **Calculate the average age of all three:**
   The sum of their ages is:
   35 (Olivia) + 59 (Bodhi) + 20 (Keisha) = 114 years.
   The average age is:
   114 / 3 = 38 years.

5. **Determine how much younger Keisha is than the average age:**
   Keisha's age is 20 years, and the average age is 38 years. Therefore, Keisha is:
