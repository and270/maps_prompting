She bought 6 dozen eclairs which cost $18 per dozen, 7 dozen cookies which cost $74 per dozen, and 8 dozen muffins for $116 per dozen. How much was the total cost?",1554.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.  
Sofia's purchases are broken down as follows:

• For the eclairs:  
She bought 6 dozen eclairs at $18 per dozen.  
So, the cost for eclairs is 6 × 18 = 108.

• For the cookies:  
She bought 7 dozen cookies at $74 per dozen.  
So, the cost for cookies is 7 × 74 = 518.

• For the muffins:  
She bought 8 dozen muffins at $116 per dozen.  
So, the cost for muffins is 8 × 116 = 928.

Now, we add up all the costs:  
Total cost = 108 + 518 + 928 = 1554.

1. You start with 20 liters of peach drink, but you spill 5 liters. So, the remaining peach drink is 20 - 5 = 15 liters.
2. The peach drink is 1/5 water. This means that in 15 liters, the water amount is 15 × (1/5) = 3 liters.
3. You also have 16 liters of lemon drink, which is 1/4 water. So, the water in the lemon drink is 16 × (1/4) = 4 liters.
4. Now, add the water amounts from both drinks: 3 liters (peach drink) + 4 liters (lemon drink) = 7 liters.

If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 6 hours if she spends 2/4 of the time running and three-sixths of the time walking?",36.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Let Jasmine’s walking speed be x mph.  
   - Since she runs 5 times faster than she walks, her running speed = 5x mph.  
   - Since she skips at 3/5 as fast as she runs, her skipping speed = (3/5) * (5x) = 3x mph.

2. We are told her skipping speed is 6 mph.  
   - So, 3x = 6.  
   - Solving for x, we get x = 6 / 3 = 2 mph.

3. Now, we know:  
   - Walking speed = 2 mph  
   - Running speed = 5 * 2 = 10 mph

4. Jasmine runs for 2/4 (which is 1/2) of the 6 hours, and she walks for 3/6 (which also is 1/2) of the time.  
   - Running time = 1/2 * 6 hours = 3 hours  
   - Walking time = 1/2 * 6 hours = 3 hours

5. Calculate the distance traveled for each activity:  
   - Distance running = running speed * running time = 10 mph * 3 hours = 30 miles  
   - Distance walking = walking speed * walking time = 2 mph * 3 hours = 6 miles

6. Total distance = 30 miles + 6 miles = 36 miles

1. First, find the remaining calories you can consume for the day:
   Daily calorie target = 2360 calories  
   Calories already consumed = 1700 calories  
   Remaining calories = 2360 - 1700 = 660 calories

2. Next, determine how many servings of bread you can eat with the remaining 660 calories:

1. First, we determine the probability that Umar rolls a number greater than 3 on one six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 (or 50%).

2. Next, we calculate the probability that he rolls an even number twice in a row. The even numbers on a die are 2, 4, and 6. For one roll, the probability of an even number is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5. Since the two rolls are independent, the probability for both rolls is 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.25 (or 25%).

3. Now, we compare the two probabilities. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25. To find how much more likely the first event is compared to the second, we can see that 0.5 is twice as great as 0.25.

1. Let T be the total amount of money Liam had. According to the problem, he did not spend all his money – he got back 8% of T as change. This means he spent the remaining 92% of his money. In equation form, the cost of the items is 0.92T.

2. We are told that Liam’s spending (the cost of the items he bought) was ₣1000. Thus, we have  
  0.92T = 1000.

3. (Although we do not need T to answer the question, this confirms our understanding of the percentages.)

4. Now, the items Liam purchased were 4 bags of popcorn and some pretzels. The cost per bag of popcorn is 25 cents and the cost per pretzel is 100 cents. Therefore, the total cost is  
  Cost = (4 × 25) + (number of pretzels × 100).

1. The care facility has a total of 1900 rooms.

1. On Friday, Oscar sold 29 boxes of brownie.  
2. The question states that on Friday, he sold 12 fewer boxes of kiwi pie than he did on Saturday.
3. It is also given that on Saturday, he sold 26 boxes of kiwi pie.
4. So, the number of kiwi pie boxes sold on Friday is 26 – 12 = 14 boxes.
5. Additionally, on Saturday, he sold 11 more boxes of brownies than he did on Friday.

Each flowering plant costs ¥3 at the store, how much money will Kimia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",3.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Each plant occupies its own width of 3 feet, and between every pair of adjacent plants, Kimia must leave a 15‑foot gap. When planting several plants in a row, only the gaps between plants count (the end gaps, if any, can be extra). Thus, if Kimia plants n plants, the total length used is  
  (n × 3) + [(n – 1) × 15].

2. This total must be no more than the length of her flower bed, which is 180 feet. So we have the inequality:  
  (n × 3) + [(n – 1) × 15] ≤ 180.

3. Simplify the expression:  
  3n + 15n – 15 ≤ 180  
  18n – 15 ≤ 180.

  18n ≤ 180 + 15  
  18n ≤ 195  
  n ≤ 195/18 ≈ 10.83.

Since n must be a whole number (you can’t plant a fraction of a plant), the maximum number of plants that can be placed is 10.

5. Kimia already owns 11 flowering plants. Since she only needs 10 plants to fill her flower bed following the spacing rules, she does not need to buy any additional plants.

6. At the store, each flowering plant costs ¥3. The number of plants Kimia needs to purchase is 10 (required) – 11 (already owned) = 0.

If 66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 27-mile walk, in minutes?",90.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Emma walks 11 miles on the beach and spends 66 minutes doing so.
  • Therefore, her speed on the beach is 11 miles / 66 minutes = 1/6 mile per minute.
2. On the sidewalk, Emma walks at four times her beach speed.
  • So, her sidewalk speed is 4 × (1/6) = 4/6 = 2/3 mile per minute.
3. The sidewalk distance is 16 miles.
  • The time taken on the sidewalk is distance / speed = 16 miles / (2/3 mile per minute) = 16 × (3/2) = 24 minutes.

Winnie eats 4 eggs a day for the first 60 days.
Each day she eats 4 eggs, so in 60 days she eats 4 × 60 = 240 eggs.
Then, she increases her consumption to 5 eggs a day for the next 96 days.
In 96 days she eats 5 × 96 = 480 eggs.
So, the total number of eggs she eats is 240 + 480 = 720 eggs.

First, convert dozens to eggs:
Tariq has 9 dozen eggs, and since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, there are 9 * 12 = 108 eggs in total.

Next, determine the eggs found by each:
Noah finds 5 eggs.
Emma finds four times as many as Noah, so she finds 4 * 5 = 20 eggs.
Olivia finds 2 less than Emma, so she finds 20 - 2 = 18 eggs.
Alejandro finds 1/2 as many as Olivia, so he finds 18 / 2 = 9 eggs.

Now, add up all the eggs that were found:
Total eggs found = Noah's + Emma's + Olivia's + Alejandro's

1. Ali starts with 96 marbles.
2. He drops three-sixths (which is the same as one-half) of them when he trips. So, the number of marbles dropped is 96 × (3/6) = 96 ÷ 2 = 48.
3. The marbles that did not fall remain with him. That is 96 − 48 = 48 marbles.
4. When Ali searches for the dropped marbles, he only finds 18 of them.
5. Now, the total marbles he recovers or still has is the sum of the ones that never dropped (48) and the ones he found (18): 48 + 18 = 66.
