p2,gsm-symbolic,o3-mini-2025-01-31,"Sophia went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, and 60 mini cheesecakes. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, convert the quantity of each pastry into dozens. Since there are 60 items of each type and 12 items make a dozen:
   - Number of dozens for each = 60 ÷ 12 = 5 dozens.

2. Calculate the cost for donuts and mini cupcakes:
   - Donuts: 5 dozens cost 5 × $19 = $95.
   - Mini cupcakes: 5 dozens cost 5 × $33 = $165.

3. Let the cost per dozen of mini cheesecakes be x dollars. Thus, the cost for 5 dozens of mini cheesecakes is 5x.

4. The total cost before discount is the sum of the costs for all pastries:
   - Total before discount = $95 + $165 + 5x = $260 + 5x.

5. Sophia actually paid $1500 after a 20% discount. This means she paid 80% of the total original price:
   - 0.8 × (Total before discount) = $1500.
   - Substitute the total cost: 0.8 × ($260 + 5x) = $1500.

6. Solve for x:
   - Divide both sides by 0.8: $260 + 5x = $1500 ÷ 0.8 = $1875.
   - Subtract $260 from both sides: 5x = $1875 - $260 = $1615.
   - Divide both sides by 5: x = $1615 ÷ 5 = $323.

The cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is $323.",323.0,1
p2,gsm-symbolic,o3-mini-2025-01-31,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving. A 300 grams bag has 6 servings. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?",350.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, determine the total calories for a full bag of popcorn.  
 • The nutritional info states 200 calories per serving and there are 6 servings in a 300‑gram bag.  
 • Total calories in the bag = 200 × 6 = 1200 calories.

2. Next, find out how many calories per gram the popcorn has.  
 • The bag weighs 300 grams with 1200 calories, so calories per gram = 1200 ÷ 300 = 4 calories per gram.

3. Now, calculate each person’s healthy daily calorie target.  
 • The target is 15 calories per pound.  
 • Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs: Target = 15 × 220 = 3300 calories.  
 • Tara weighs 140 lbs: Target = 15 × 140 = 2100 calories.

4. Determine how many net calories they have already taken in.  
 • Hiroshi has consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise.  
  – Net calories for Hiroshi = 1100 − 200 = 900 calories.  
 • Tara has consumed 900 calories in food plus 200 calories in ice cream.  
  – Net calories for Tara = 900 + 200 = 1100 calories.

5. Find the remaining calories each needs to reach their healthy target.  
 • Hiroshi’s remaining calories = 3300 − 900 = 2400 calories.  
 • Tara’s remaining calories = 2100 − 1100 = 1000 calories.

6. Calculate the grams of popcorn needed by each (using 4 calories per gram).  
 • For Hiroshi: grams = 2400 ÷ 4 = 600 grams.  
 • For Tara: grams = 1000 ÷ 4 = 250 grams.

7. Finally, determine how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs compared to Tara.  
 • Difference = 600 grams − 250 grams = 350 grams.

She already has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges of her large country home. She also purchased 200 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Daphne remain with?",335.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Daphne has plants on her window ledges. There are 56 ledges, with 8 plants on each, which gives a total of 56 * 8 = 448 plants.

2. Two days ago, she received 23 new potted plants, so her total increased to 448 + 23 = 471 plants.

3. Yesterday, she purchased 200 new plants. Now, the total number of plants is 471 + 200 = 671 plants.

4. Tomorrow, she will give away 6 plants from each of her 56 ledges. The total number of plants she will give away is 56 * 6 = 336 plants.

However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The city is 80 miles across, so 1/4 of the city equals 80/4 = 20 miles.

2. Initially, the fog bank moves at a rate such that it covers 4 miles in 60 minutes. This means the initial speed is 4 miles per hour.

3. In the first 60 minutes, the fog bank covers the first 4 miles.

4. After one hour, the wind speed (and hence the fog's speed) is halved. So the new speed becomes 4/2 = 2 miles per hour.

5. The remaining distance to cover is 20 miles - 4 miles = 16 miles.

6. At 2 miles per hour, the time needed to cover 16 miles is 16 miles / 2 mph = 8 hours. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 8 hours equal 8 × 60 = 480 minutes.

7. Adding the initial 60 minutes, the total time is 60 minutes + 480 minutes = 540 minutes.

On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 2-hour episodes. On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?",6.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. On Tuesday, Santiago watched a 4-hour episode and on Wednesday, he watched another 4-hour episode. So, these two days add up to 4 + 4 = 8 hours.

2. On Friday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. Since 45 minutes is 0.75 hours, Friday's total is 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.

3. On Saturday, he watched three 2-hour episodes, which adds up to 3 × 2 = 6 hours.

4. On Sunday, he watched three 15-minute episodes. Since 15 minutes is 0.25 hours, Sunday’s total is 3 × 0.25 = 0.75 hours.

5. Let x be the number of 15-minute episodes he watched on Thursday. Each episode is 0.25 hours, so the total time for Thursday is 0.25x hours.

6. Adding up the hours from all days, we get:
   8 (Tue & Wed) + 3.75 (Fri) + 6 (Sat) + 0.75 (Sun) + 0.25x (Thu) = 20 hours.

7. Simplify the constant hours:
   8 + 3.75 + 6 + 0.75 = 18.5 hours.

In the span of two years, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?",1764.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, we determine the yield of bananas for one harvest.  
 • Ravi’s banana field is 10 square yards.  
 • It is given that there are 36 bananas in (4/5) of a square yard.  
 • To find the number of bananas per square yard, we divide 36 by (4/5):  
  36 ÷ (4/5) = 36 × (5/4) = 45 bananas per square yard.  
 • So, in one harvest, the banana field yields:  
  10 square yards × 45 bananas/square yard = 450 bananas.

2. Next, we calculate the yield of apricots for one harvest.  
 • Ravi’s apricot field is 13 square yards, which produces 12 apricots per square yard.  
 • Thus, one harvest from the apricot field yields:  
  13 square yards × 12 apricots/square yard = 156 apricots.

3. Ravi harvests every 4 months. In 2 years (which is 24 months), the number of harvests is:  
  24 months ÷ 4 months per harvest = 6 harvests.

1. For a twenty-sided die, the outcomes greater than 5 are the numbers 6 through 20. There are 15 such outcomes out of 20, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 in one roll is 15/20 = 3/4.

2. The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16, which is 0.5625 or 56.25%.

3. For even numbers on a twenty-sided die, there are 10 even outcomes (2, 4, 6, …, 20) out of 20. Thus, the probability of rolling an even number in one roll is 10/20 = 1/2.

4. The probability of rolling an even number four times in a row is (1/2)^4 = 1/16, which is 0.0625 or 6.25%.

1. Priya bought 21 kgs of fudge. The sale offer is: Buy 15 kgs at ₺22 per kg, and get 4 kgs at 1/4 off (i.e., 25% discount). Since she bought more than 19 kgs (15 + 4), the breakdown is:
 • 15 kgs at full price: 15 × ₺22 = ₺330.
 • 4 kgs at 1/4 off. The discounted price is ¾ of ₺22, which is ₺16.50 per kg. So, 4 × ₺16.50 = ₺66.

   - Total puppies = 131.
   - Initially, puppies with spots = 23.
   - Unspotted puppies = 131 - 23 = 108.
   - After the vet's visit, half of these unspotted puppies are found to have spots. That number is 108 / 2 = 54.
   - Updated spotted puppies for Jamal = 23 + 54 = 77.

2. For Gabriel's dog:
   - Total puppies = 47.
   - Puppies with spots = 13.

3. For Yuki:
   - Yuki has 54 dogs.
   - Each dog has 13 puppies with spots, so total spotted puppies = 54 * 13 = 702.

4. Now, combine the totals:
   - Total puppies overall = Jamal's 131 + Gabriel's 47 + Yuki's 702 = 880.
   - Total spotted puppies overall = Jamal's 77 + Gabriel's 13 + Yuki's 702 = 792.

5. To find the percentage of puppies that have spots:
   - Percentage = (Total spotted puppies / Total puppies) * 100 = (792 / 880) * 100.
   - Simplify: 792 ÷ 880 = 0.9, so 0.9 * 100 = 90%.

p2,gsm-symbolic,o3-mini-2025-01-31,"A farmer is buying feed for his pigs. He buys a variety of hay, corn, cucumbers and apples. Since apples are a rare treat, he only buys four 3-kg boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys twelve 6-kg bags. Hay are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys thirty four 39-kg packs. Corn are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 17-kg sacks. Finally, he buys 43 kgs of groceries, and 27 kgs of tools, and 100 kgs of wood. A farm truck can carry 160 kgs at a time. If the farmer has three trucks, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the purchased items?",4.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, calculate the total weight of each type of item:
   - Apples: 4 boxes at 3 kg each → 4 × 3 = 12 kg.
   - Cucumbers: 12 bags at 6 kg each → 12 × 6 = 72 kg.
   - Hay: 34 packs at 39 kg each → 34 × 39 = 1,326 kg.
   - Corn: 20 sacks at 17 kg each → 20 × 17 = 340 kg.
   - Groceries: 43 kg.
   - Tools: 27 kg.
   - Wood: 100 kg.

2. Now, sum up all the weights:
   - Sum of apples and cucumbers: 12 + 72 = 84 kg.
   - Add hay: 84 + 1,326 = 1,410 kg.
   - Add corn: 1,410 + 340 = 1,750 kg.
   - Add groceries: 1,750 + 43 = 1,793 kg.
   - Add tools: 1,793 + 27 = 1,820 kg.
   - Add wood: 1,820 + 100 = 1,920 kg.
   So, the total weight is 1,920 kg.

3. Each truck can carry 160 kg at a time and the farmer has 3 trucks. Therefore, in one trip, all three trucks can carry:
   3 × 160 kg = 480 kg.

4. Finally, calculate the number of trips needed:
   Divide the total weight by the capacity per trip:
   1,920 kg ÷ 480 kg/trip = 4 trips.

Later, Uma saw another 10-foot shark with 6 remoras, each 8 inches long, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?",45.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

Step 1: Consider the 40-foot shark.  
• It has 18 remoras, each 16 inches long.  
• Total initial remora length = 18 × 16 = 288 inches.  
• However, 1/6 of the remoras swam away. 1/6 of 18 = 3, so 18 − 3 = 15 remoras remain.  
• Total remaining remora length = 15 × 16 = 240 inches.  
• Convert the shark's length to inches: 40 feet × 12 = 480 inches.  
• Percentage of the shark’s body covered by remoras = (240 / 480) × 100 = 50%.

Step 2: Now, consider the 10-foot shark.  
• It has 6 remoras, each 8 inches long.  
• Total remora length = 6 × 8 = 48 inches.  
• Convert the shark's length to inches: 10 feet × 12 = 120 inches.  
• Percentage of the shark’s body covered by remoras = (48 / 120) × 100 = 40%.

Step 3: Find the average percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras.  
• Average percentage = (50% + 40%) / 2 = 45%.

Unfortunately, 2 tables break. Carlos then eats one-fifth of all the almonds. How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?",14.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Carlos starts with 720 almonds.
2. Each bowl can hold 24 almonds.
3. Each table can hold three times as many almonds as a bowl, so each table holds 3 × 24 = 72 almonds.
4. Initially, Carlos has 7 bowls and 3 tables. However, 2 tables break, so only 1 table remains.
5. After the breakage, the total container capacity he has available is:
  • Bowls: 7 × 24 = 168 almonds
  • Table: 1 × 72 = 72 almonds
  • Total capacity = 168 + 72 = 240 almonds.
6. Next, Carlos eats one-fifth of all the almonds. One-fifth of 720 is 720 / 5 = 144 almonds.
7. The remaining almonds are 720 − 144 = 576 almonds.
8. To place all 576 almonds, he currently has capacity for 240 almonds. The additional capacity needed is 576 − 240 = 336 almonds.

1. Diego is currently 19 years old.

2. In 9 years, Aisha's age will be twice Diego's current age. Diego's current age is 19, so twice that is 2 × 19 = 38.  
   Therefore, in 9 years, Aisha will be 38 years old.

3. To find Aisha’s current age, subtract 9 years from 38:  
   38 − 9 = 29.  
   So, Aisha is currently 29 years old.

4. Diego’s brother, Esteban, is 6 years younger than Diego.  
   Since Diego is 19, Esteban is 19 − 6 = 13 years old.

5. Nadia, Aisha’s sister, is 10 years older than Esteban.  
   Since Esteban is 13, Nadia is 13 + 10 = 23 years old.

 • A sweater that needs 6 skeins  
 • A poncho that needs 8 skeins  
 • A pair of gloves that needs 8 skeins

The store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs; any additional rice is sold at the regular price. Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2. How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Mohammed normally buys rice at ¥15 per kg, but his preferred brand is sold out. He must buy a more expensive brand, which costs 20% more. This means the price per kg for the new rice is:
  15 + (20% of 15) = 15 + 3 = ¥18 per kg.

2. He uses 3 kgs of rice per day, and he wants to buy a week's worth. Since there are 7 days in a week, he needs:
  3 kgs/day × 7 days = 21 kgs of rice.

3. The store offers a 40% discount on rice for up to 10 kgs. With a 40% discount, the cost per kg is reduced by 40%, meaning he pays 60% of the price:
  60% of ¥18 = 0.6 × 18 = ¥10.8 per kg.
  So, for the first 10 kgs, the cost is:
  10 kgs × ¥10.8 = ¥108.

4. For the remaining rice, the discount doesn’t apply. The extra rice is:
  21 kgs - 10 kgs = 11 kgs.
  At the regular price of ¥18 per kg, the cost is:
  11 kgs × ¥18 = ¥198.

5. Adding the cost for both portions of the rice:
  Total rice cost = ¥108 + ¥198 = ¥306.

1. First, add the signatures each sister already has.
  Jasmine: 36 signatures

2. They want to reach 145 signatures by the end of spring break, so the signatures needed in the remaining 2 weeks are:
  145 - 67 = 78 signatures

3. Jasmine’s situation changes during the last 2 weeks. During the first 6 weeks, Jasmine collected 36 signatures. That means she collected an average of:
  36 / 6 = 6 signatures per week
  However, because she is only able to collect on weekends in the last 2 weeks, her weekly collection is reduced by 5, so she will now collect:

1. They start at home and take 16 minutes to reach the corner.
2. From the corner, it takes another 52 minutes to get to the gym.
  So, the time taken to reach the gym the first time is 16 + 52 = 68 minutes.
3. At the gym, they realize they forgot their wallets, so they go back home.

Leon starts with 312 ounces of water.

1. Compute the water used for giant cubes:
   • There are 10 giant cubes.
   • Each giant cube uses 12 ounces.
   • Total water for giant cubes = 10 * 12 = 120 ounces.

2. Compute the water used for medium cubes:
   • There are 12 medium cubes.
   • Each medium cube uses 5 ounces.
   • Total water for medium cubes = 12 * 5 = 60 ounces.

3. Compute the water used for small cubes:
   • There are 14 small cubes.
   • Each small cube uses 1/2 ounce.
   • Total water for small cubes = 14 * (1/2) = 7 ounces.

4. Determine the number of tiny cubes:
   • Leon makes 48 cubes in total.
   • Given cubes: 10 (giant) + 12 (medium) + 14 (small) = 36 cubes.
   • Number of tiny cubes = 48 - 36 = 12 cubes.
   • Each tiny cube is half the size of a small cube, so it uses (1/2) / 2 = 1/4 ounce.
   • Total water for tiny cubes = 12 * (1/4) = 3 ounces.

5. Calculate the total water used:
   • Total water used = 120 (giant) + 60 (medium) + 7 (small) + 3 (tiny) = 190 ounces.

1. The bag of building blocks has 43 blocks.
2. The bin of stuffed animals has 5 animals.
3. The total number of blocks and stuffed animals is 43 + 5 = 48.
4. The number of action figures is twice that, so 2 * 48 = 96.
5. The crayon box has 12 crayons.
6. The sticker book has 6 pages with 12 stickers on each page, which is 6 * 12 = 72 stickers.
7. The tower of stacking rings has 29 rings.
8. Let the number of bouncy balls be x.

Now, adding up all the items:
43 (blocks) + 5 (stuffed animals) + 96 (action figures) + 12 (crayons) + 72 (stickers) + 29 (rings) + x (bouncy balls) = 320.

Calculating the known total:
43 + 5 = 48  
48 + 96 = 144  
144 + 12 = 156  
156 + 72 = 228  
228 + 29 = 257

To find x, subtract 257 from 320:
x = 320 - 257 = 63.

Due to the pandemic, 20 patients are admitted into the care facility each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks.",530.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The care facility has a total capacity of 1900 rooms.

2. Out of these, 1/4 of the rooms are initially occupied. This gives:
  Occupied rooms = 1900 ÷ 4 = 475 rooms.

3. Also, 1/4 of the rooms are out of service. This gives:
  Out-of-service rooms = 1900 ÷ 4 = 475 rooms.

4. The remaining rooms are in service. So the number of in‑service rooms is:
  In-service rooms = 1900 - 475 = 1425 rooms.

5. Initially, of these in‑service rooms, 475 are already occupied. Hence, the number of unoccupied in‑service rooms is:
  Unoccupied in‑service rooms = 1425 - 475 = 950 rooms.

6. Due to the pandemic, 20 patients are admitted each day. Over 3 weeks, and knowing that 3 weeks = 21 days, the total new admissions are:
  New admissions = 20 × 21 = 420 patients.

7. These 420 new patients will occupy 420 of the available 950 in‑service rooms. Therefore, the new number of occupied in‑service rooms becomes:
  Final occupied in‑service rooms = 475 (initial) + 420 (new) = 895 rooms.

8. So, the remaining unoccupied in‑service rooms are:
  Unoccupied in‑service rooms now = 1425 - 895 = 530 rooms.

9. Finally, the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility includes both the unoccupied in‑service rooms and the out‑of‑service rooms:
  Total unoccupied rooms = 530 (in‑service) + 475 (out‑of‑service) = 1005 rooms.

On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday and 21 boxes of apricot pie. On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?",796.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. On Wednesday, Faisal sold:
 • Muffins: 27 boxes.
 • Apricot pies: The problem states he sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie than he did on Thursday. Since on Thursday he sold 21 boxes of apricot pie, on Wednesday he sold 21 – 13 = 8 boxes.

2. On Thursday, his sales were:
 • Muffins: He sold 11 more boxes than he did on Wednesday. Since Wednesday he sold 27 boxes, on Thursday he sold 27 + 11 = 38 boxes.
 • Apricot pies: 21 boxes.

3. The problem states that on Friday he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. For similar items we assume:
 • Muffins on Friday = Wednesday’s muffins + Thursday’s muffins = 27 + 38 = 65 boxes.
 • Apricot pies on Friday = Wednesday’s apricot pies + Thursday’s apricot pies = 8 + 21 = 29 boxes.

4. Next, we calculate the earning for each day knowing that:
 • Each muffin earns ₺9.
 • Each apricot pie earns ₺21.

 Wednesday's earnings:
  – Muffins: 27 boxes × ₺9 = ₺243.
  – Apricot pies: 8 boxes × ₺21 = ₺168.
  – Total = ₺243 + ₺168 = ₺411.

 Thursday's earnings:
  – Muffins: 38 boxes × ₺9 = ₺342.
  – Apricot pies: 21 boxes × ₺21 = ₺441.
  – Total = ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783.

 Friday's earnings:
  – Muffins: 65 boxes × ₺9 = ₺585.
  – Apricot pies: 29 boxes × ₺21 = ₺609.
  – Total = ₺585 + ₺609 = ₺1,194.

How many students are leaving early to the tournament?",66.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Mrs. Garcia’s class has 120 students.
2. 50% of these students are swimmers. That means there are 0.50 × 120 = 60 swimmers.
3. The remaining students = 120 – 60 = 60.
4. Out of these 60 remaining students, 45% are choir members and another 45% are dancers. (The wording “choir members or part of dancers” is interpreted as there being two separate groups, one of choir members and one of dancers.)
   • Number of choir members = 0.45 × 60 = 27.
   • Number of dancers = 0.45 × 60 = 27.
5. However, half of the swimmers are absent due to sickness, so only half of the swimmers will leave:
   • Swimmers leaving = 60 / 2 = 30.
6. Now we have three groups leaving early:
   • Swimmers: 30 students
   • Choir members: 27 students
   • Dancers: 27 students
   Adding these gives 30 + 27 + 27 = 84 students.

Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.,163.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, Olga washes each clam, and it takes 12 seconds per clam. For 150 clams, the total washing time is 150 × 12 seconds = 1800 seconds. Converting seconds to minutes: 1800 ÷ 60 = 30 minutes.

2. Next, she peels the clams. Since she can peel 6 clams per minute, for 150 clams the peeling time is 150 ÷ 6 = 25 minutes.

3. After peeling, Olga needs a 13-minute break before she starts sautéing.

4. Now, she sautés the clams. She can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes, so for 150 clams the time needed is 5 batches (because 150 ÷ 30 = 5), which takes 5 × 19 = 95 minutes.

5. Finally, add up all the times: washing (30 minutes) + peeling (25 minutes) + break (13 minutes) + sautéing (95 minutes) = 30 + 25 + 13 + 95 = 163 minutes.

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 50% for the second half. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?",1755.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, determine the normal daily consumption before any diet:
   - The uncle eats 10 pizzas per day.
   - The spouse eats 20 pizzas per day.
   - Their combined consumption is 10 + 20 = 30 pizzas per day.
   - The grandchild eats two‐fourths (which is 50%) of that combined number, so he eats 0.5 × 30 = 15 pizzas per day.
   - Therefore, the total normal daily consumption is 10 + 20 + 15 = 45 pizzas.

2. In the first month, the family sticks to their normal routine. Assuming a month has 30 days, the total pizzas eaten in the first month are:
   - 45 pizzas/day × 30 days = 1350 pizzas.

3. In the second month, the family goes on a diet with two phases:
   - For the first half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by 60%. This means they eat only 40% of what they normally would.
     • Daily consumption during this phase = 45 × 0.40 = 18 pizzas.
     • Total for the first half = 18 pizzas/day × 15 days = 270 pizzas.
   - For the second half of the month (the remaining 15 days), they reduce their consumption by an additional 50% relative to the already reduced amount. This means they now eat 50% of 18 pizzas per day.
     • Daily consumption during this phase = 18 × 0.50 = 9 pizzas.
     • Total for the second half = 9 pizzas/day × 15 days = 135 pizzas.

4. Now, add the two phases of the second month:
   - Total pizzas in the second month = 270 + 135 = 405 pizzas.

1. Mohammed receives 30 emails a day.
2. 20% of those emails don't require a response. So, the number of emails that don't need a response is 0.2 × 30 = 6.
3. This means the remaining emails that might require a response are 30 - 6 = 24.
4. From these 24 emails, Mohammed can respond to 2 less than half of them. Half of 24 is 12, so subtracting 2 gives 12 - 2 = 10.

1. First, denote Ananya's uninjured walking speeds:
  • Let her uninjured beach speed be v.
  • Then her uninjured sidewalk speed is 2v (since it’s twice the beach speed).

2. However, due to her injury, her speeds are halved:
  • Her effective beach speed becomes v/2.
  • Her effective sidewalk speed becomes 2v/2, which simplifies to v.

3. We are told that she spends 50 minutes on the beach covering 10 miles. Using the formula time = distance/speed:
  • Time on the beach = 10 ÷ (v/2) = 10 * (2/v) = 20/v minutes.
  • Setting this equal to 50 minutes gives:
    20/v = 50
    Solve for v: v = 20/50 = 0.4 miles per minute.

3. Third 10 seconds: 4 times the initial rate pop, so 4 × 70 = 280 kernels pop.
4. Final 10 seconds: The rate slows to half of the previous 10 seconds' count (which was 280), so 280 / 2 = 140 kernels pop.
5. After taking the skillet off the heat, residual heat causes a further ¼ of the final 10 seconds' kernels to pop, which is ¼ × 140 = 35 kernels.
6. Total kernels popped = 70 + 140 + 280 + 140 + 35 = 665.
7. Noah gives 1/5 of his popcorn to his brother Luca, so Luca gets 665 / 5 = 133 kernels.
8. The remaining popcorn with Noah = 665 - 133 = 532 kernels.
9. The difference in the amount Noah has to eat compared to his brother is 532 - 133 = 399.

The answer is 399.",399.0,1

1. The building has 5 white bricks.
2. It has twice as many orange bricks as white bricks, so there are 2 × 5 = 10 orange bricks.
3. Together, white and orange bricks add up to 5 + 10 = 15 bricks.
4. Since the total number of bricks is 30, the number of green bricks is 30 - 15 = 15.
5. The percentage of green bricks is (15/30) × 100 = 50%.
The answer is 50%.",50.0,1
p2,gsm-symbolic,o3-mini-2025-01-31,"Olivia, Bodhi are currently 24 years apart in age. Olivia and Keisha are currently 15 years apart. Olivia, who is younger than Bodhi but older than Keisha, will be 42 in 7 years. How much younger is Keisha than the average age of all three?",18.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. We are told that in 7 years Olivia will be 42. Therefore, her current age is 42 - 7 = 35.

2. Olivia and Bodhi are 24 years apart, with Bodhi being older than Olivia. So, Bodhi's age is 35 + 24 = 59.

3. Olivia and Keisha are 15 years apart, with Olivia being older than Keisha. Therefore, Keisha's age is 35 - 15 = 20.

4. Now, we find the average age of all three:
   Average age = (Olivia's age + Bodhi's age + Keisha's age) / 3
                = (35 + 59 + 20) / 3
                = 114 / 3
                = 38.

5. Finally, to determine how much younger Keisha is than the average age, we subtract Keisha's age from the average:
   38 - 20 = 18.

The answer is 18.",18.0,1
