p1,gsm-symbolic,o3-mini-2025-01-31,"Beatriz went to the patisserie and bought various types of baked goods. She bought 6 dozen croissants which cost $19 per dozen, 4 dozen macarons which cost $77 per dozen, and 3 dozen brownies for $118 per dozen. How much was the total cost if she received 25% discount on all purchases?",582.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, we calculate the cost for each type of baked good:
   - Croissants: 6 dozen at $19 per dozen = 6 × 19 = $114.
   - Macarons: 4 dozen at $77 per dozen = 4 × 77 = $308.
   - Brownies: 3 dozen at $118 per dozen = 3 × 118 = $354.

2. Next, add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
   Total cost = $114 + $308 + $354 = $776.

3. Beatriz received a 25% discount, which means she pays 75% of the total cost:
   Final cost = 75% of $776 = 0.75 × 776 = $582.

But as I pour it, I spill 7 liters of the mango drink. To make up for that, I add 7 liters of water to the mix. What percentage of the final mix is water?",50.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. We start with 16 liters of mango drink that is one‑ninth water. This means:
  • Water in mango drink = 16 × (1/9) = 16/9 liters.
  • Other components = 16 − 16/9 = 128/9 liters.

2. However, 7 liters of the mango drink are spilled. Assuming the spilled drink has the same water ratio:
  • Water spilled = 7 × (1/9) = 7/9 liters.
  • Other components spilled = 7 × (8/9) = 56/9 liters.

3. The remaining mango drink is 16 − 7 = 9 liters, which contains:
  • Water remaining = 16/9 − 7/9 = 9/9 = 1 liter.
  • Other components remaining = 128/9 − 56/9 = 72/9 = 8 liters.

4. Next, we have 14 liters of apple drink that is one‑half water:
  • Water in apple drink = 14 × (1/2) = 7 liters.
  • Other components = 14 − 7 = 7 liters.

5. Now, we mix the remaining mango drink with the apple drink:
  • Total volume = 9 liters + 14 liters = 23 liters.
  • Total water = 1 liter (from mango) + 7 liters (from apple) = 8 liters.
  • Total other components = 8 liters (from mango) + 7 liters (from apple) = 15 liters.

6. To make up for the spilled liquid, 7 liters of water are added to the mix. This adjusts the totals to:
  • New total volume = 23 liters + 7 liters = 30 liters.
  • New total water = 8 liters + 7 liters = 15 liters.
  • Other components remain 15 liters.

7. To find the percentage of water in the final mix:
  • Percentage of water = (Total water / Total volume) × 100
  • = (15 / 30) × 100 = 50%.

If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 10 hours if she spends 2/5 of the time running, 1/2 of the time skipping, and the remaining of the time walking?",27.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Let the walking speed be w miles per hour.
2. Since Mei runs four times as fast as she walks, her running speed is 4w.
3. Since she skips at 1/2 the speed of her running, her skipping speed is (1/2) × 4w = 2w.
4. We are given that her skipping speed is 2 miles per hour, so set 2w = 2. This gives w = 1 mile per hour.
5. Therefore, her walking speed is 1 mph, and her running speed is 4 mph.
6. Mei spends 2/5 of the 10 hours running, which is (2/5) × 10 = 4 hours. In that time, she covers 4 mph × 4 hours = 16 miles.
7. She spends 1/2 of the 10 hours skipping, which is (1/2) × 10 = 5 hours. In that time, she covers 2 mph × 5 hours = 10 miles.
8. The remaining time is for walking: 10 - (4 + 5) = 1 hour. In that time, she covers 1 mph × 1 hour = 1 mile.
9. Adding these distances together gives the total distance: 16 + 10 + 1 = 27 miles.

1. The bag is 150 oz and contains 5 servings. That means one serving weighs:
  150 oz ÷ 5 = 30 oz per serving.

2. Each serving has 200 calories, so the calories per ounce are:
  200 calories ÷ 30 oz ≈ 6.67 calories per oz.

3. Your daily calorie target is 2300 calories. You have already consumed 1200 calories, but because you exercised and burned 100 calories, your net consumption is:

Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 4 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Kayla remain with?",703.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, determine the number of potted plants already on the window ledges.  
   Since Kayla has 65 window ledges and there are 12 plants on each ledge, she has 65 × 12 = 780 plants.

2. Next, add the new plants she received and purchased.

1. On Saturday and Sunday, Noah watched 4-hour episodes each night, so he watched a total of 4 + 4 = 8 hours.
2. On Tuesday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. Since 45 minutes is 0.75 hours, Tuesday’s total is 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.

1. First, find the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 on a 20-sided die.  
 • Numbers greater than 10 are 11, 12, …, 20, which gives 10 outcomes.  
 • Therefore, the probability is 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5.

2. Next, find the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row.  
 • On a 20-sided die, there are 10 odd numbers, so the probability of an odd number on one roll is 10/20 = 1/2.  
 • For four consecutive rolls, the probability is (1/2)^4 = 1/16 = 0.0625.

3. Now, to compare how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 10:  
 • The probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is 0.5, and the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row is 0.0625.  
 • The ratio is 0.5 ÷ 0.0625 = 8. This means rolling a number greater than 10 is 8 times as likely as rolling four odd numbers in a row.

Step 1: Determine the number of boys and girls initially.
- Total fourth-graders = 80.
- Number of girls = 34.
- Therefore, number of boys = 80 - 34 = 46.

Step 2: Determine how many girls and boys were present on Thursday.

2. In the first purchase, Theo buys additional fruits:  
  • He bought 63 more kiwis.

1. First, consider the taffy purchase. The sale says: ""Buy 16 kgs at $23 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/2 off.""  
 • For the first 16 kgs, the cost is 16 × $23 = $368.  
 • For the next 4 kgs, the price per kg is half of $23, which is $11.50. So, 4 × $11.50 = $46.  
 • Thus, the deal for 20 kgs of taffy costs $368 + $46 = $414.

2. Ananya scooped up 23 kgs of taffy, which is 20 kgs (that used the deal) plus an extra 3 kgs. The extra 3 kgs are at the full price of $23 per kg, which costs 3 × $23 = $69.  
 • So, the total cost for 23 kgs of taffy is $414 + $69 = $483.

Andre starts with $100.
After his purchase he has 3% of his money left. Since 3% of $100 = $3, he spent 100 - 3 = $97 on his items.
He bought 4 bags of crackers, with each bag costing 75 cents. So, the cost for crackers is 4 × $0.75 = $3.
He also bought 7 packs of pretzels, with each pack costing $7. So, the cost for pretzels is 7 × $7 = $49.
Let the number of gum he bought be x. Each gum costs 100 cents, which is $1, so the cost for gum is x × $1 = $x.
The total spent on crackers, pretzels, and gum equals $97, so we can set up the equation:
  $3 + $49 + $x = $97
Combine the costs of crackers and pretzels:

  w² + 16w = 225.
4. Rearranging it into a quadratic equation:
  w² + 16w - 225 = 0.

2. Each plate holds twice as many crackers as a bowl. Since one bowl holds 21, each plate holds 2 × 21 = 42 crackers. With 4 plates, the plates can hold 4 × 42 = 168 crackers.
3. Together, the bowls and plates can hold 231 + 168 = 399 crackers.
4. Deshawn originally has 615 crackers, but he eats one third of them. The number of crackers he eats is 615 × (1/3) = 205. So after eating, he is left with 615 − 205 = 410 crackers.
5. Since he can only place 399 crackers into the bowls and plates, the number of crackers he cannot place is 410 − 399 = 11.

James is 8 years old.
In 4 years, Jasmine will be 4 times as old as James is now, so she will be 4 * 8 = 32 years old.
That means currently, Jasmine is 32 - 4 = 28 years old.
In 6 years, James will be 8 + 6 = 14 years old, and Jasmine will be 28 + 6 = 34 years old.

Emma wants to make two warm jackets for herself, each needing 11 skeins of wool. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?",318.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, calculate the wool needed for one grandchild's set of winter wear:
  • Poncho: 18 skeins  
  • Hat: 17 skeins  
  • Beanie: 15 skeins  
  • Booties: 8 skeins  
  • Gloves: 16 skeens  
  Adding these gives: 18 + 17 + 15 + 8 + 16 = 74 skeins

2. Since Emma has 4 grandchildren, the total skeins for the grandchildren is:
  74 skeins/child × 4 = 296 skeins

3. Next, calculate the wool needed for Emma’s two warm jackets:
  Each jacket needs 11 skeins, so:

He also decided to buy himself a bagel for ₣4. Since he shopped more than ₣50, he received a ₣23 discount. How much does Santiago have to pay?",275.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The normal price per kilogram of flour is ₣10, but Santiago had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 40% more.  
   - Increase in price = 40% of ₣10 = 0.40 × 10 = ₣4.  
   - New price per kilogram = ₣10 + ₣4 = ₣14.

2. Santiago uses 3 kilograms of flour per day and buys enough for a week (7 days).  
   - Total flour needed = 3 kg/day × 7 days = 21 kg.

3. The cost for the flour is calculated by multiplying the total kilograms by the new price per kilogram.  
   - Flour cost = 21 kg × ₣14/kg = ₣294.

Each cow eats as much as a goat and alpaca eat combined. If there are 21 goats, 7 alpacas, and 21 cows, how many kilograms of grain does Alejandro need?",798.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Each goat needs 9 kilograms of grain.
2. Each alpaca needs 3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs. Twice the amount for a goat is 2 × 9 = 18 kilograms, so an alpaca needs 18 - 3 = 15 kilograms.
3. Each cow eats as much as a goat and an alpaca combined, so a cow needs 9 + 15 = 24 kilograms.
4. Now, calculate the total grain for all animals:
   - Total for 21 goats: 21 × 9 = 189 kilograms.
   - Total for 7 alpacas: 7 × 15 = 105 kilograms.
   - Total for 21 cows: 21 × 24 = 504 kilograms.

1. Total number of beds in the hospital = 800.
2. One-fifth of the beds are out of service, so:
  Out-of-service beds = (1/5) × 800 = 160.
3. The remaining beds available for use (in service) = 800 - 160 = 640.
4. Initially, 1/8 of all beds are occupied. This means:
  Occupied beds = (1/8) × 800 = 100.
5. So, the available beds that are unoccupied initially in working beds = 640 - 100 = 540.
6. Due to the flu season, 35 patients are admitted each day. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of admissions is:

On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday and 28 boxes of orange pie. On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the cupcake cost ₺10 and the orange pie cost ₺22, how much was Andre's average daily earning?",980.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. On Monday, Andre sold 24 boxes of cupcakes.  
2. The problem tells us that on Monday he sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pies than he did on Tuesday. We are told that on Tuesday he sold 28 boxes of orange pie.  
   • Thus, Monday's orange pie sales = 28 − 16 = 12 boxes.

3. On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday.  
   • Thus, Tuesday's cupcake sales = 24 + 11 = 35 boxes.

4. For Wednesday, it is given that he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. We interpret this to mean that on Wednesday:
   • Cupcake sales = Monday's cupcakes + Tuesday's cupcakes = 24 + 35 = 59 boxes, and  
   • Orange pie sales = Monday's orange pies + Tuesday's orange pies = 12 + 28 = 40 boxes.

5. Next, we calculate the earnings for each day knowing that each cupcake box costs ₺10 and each orange pie box costs ₺22.

   • Monday’s earnings:
     - Cupcakes: 24 × ₺10 = ₺240
     - Orange pies: 12 × ₺22 = ₺264
     - Total for Monday = ₺240 + ₺264 = ₺504

   • Tuesday’s earnings:
     - Cupcakes: 35 × ₺10 = ₺350
     - Orange pies: 28 × ₺22 = ₺616
     - Total for Tuesday = ₺350 + ₺616 = ₺966

   • Wednesday’s earnings:
     - Cupcakes: 59 × ₺10 = ₺590
     - Orange pies: 40 × ₺22 = ₺880
     - Total for Wednesday = ₺590 + ₺880 = ₺1470

6. Finally, we find the average daily earning by summing the totals and dividing by 3:
   • Sum of earnings = ₺504 + ₺966 + ₺1470 = ₺2940  
   • Average daily earning = ₺2940 / 3 = ₺980

Out of the remaining class, 40% of the students are robotics club members or part of choir members. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away competition. Half of the volleyball players are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the competition?",62.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, we are told that 24% of the 125 students are volleyball players.  
  Number of volleyball players = 0.24 × 125 = 30.

2. However, half of the volleyball players are absent due to sickness.  
  That means only half of them (30 ÷ 2 = 15) will go to the competition.

3. Next, remove all volleyball players from the class to see how the remaining students are divided.  
  Remaining students = 125 – 30 = 95.

4. The problem states that “40% of the students are robotics club members or part of choir members.”  
  When the phrasing “or” is used in this context it can be interpreted as the rest of the class (i.e. the 95) being divided into two distinct groups—robotics club members and choir members. In fact, since there are three groups in total (volleyball, robotics, and choir) and we have already taken the volleyball group, it is natural to partition the remaining 95 students into robotics and choir groups.  
  A common way to split the remainder is to let 40% of them be in one group (robotics) and the remaining 60% be in the other group (choir).  
  Robotics club members = 0.40 × 95 = 38.  
  Choir members = 0.60 × 95 = 57.

5. Now, the three groups of students leaving early are:  
  •  Present volleyball players = 15  
  •  Robotics club members = 38  
  •  Choir members = 57  
  Their total is 15 + 38 + 57 = 110.

6. Finally, “3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups.”  
  Since there are 3 groups, the total number of cheerleaders is 3 × 3 = 9.

  110 + 9 = 119.

1. Washing: It takes Yara 19 minutes to wash all 60 clams.
2. Peeling: Yara can peel 6 clams per minute. For 60 clams, she will need 60 / 6 = 10 minutes.
3. Sautéing: Yara can sauté 20 clams in 8 minutes. This means her sautéing rate is 20/8 = 2.5 clams per minute. For 60 clams, she will need 60 / 2.5 = 24 minutes.
4. Since Yara cannot work on more than one task at a time, the total time required is the sum of the times for washing, peeling, and sautéing.

2. Due to her injury, both speeds are reduced by half. This gives:
  • Injured beach speed = b/2  
  • Injured sidewalk speed = (4b)/2 = 2b
3. The walk consists of 10 km on the beach and 10 km on the sidewalk.
4. The time spent on the beach is:
  Time (beach) = Distance / Speed = 10 ÷ (b/2) = 10 × (2/b) = 20/b minutes.
5. We are told that 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. Thus, we set:
  20/b = 60  
  Solving for b: b = 20/60 = 1/3 km per minute.
6. Next, calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:
  Time (sidewalk) = Distance / Speed = 10 ÷ (2b) = 10 ÷ [2 × (1/3)] = 10 ÷ (2/3) = 10 × (3/2) = 15 minutes.
7. Finally, the total time for the 20-kilometer walk is:
  Total time = Time (beach) + Time (sidewalk) = 60 + 15 = 75 minutes.

1. First, note that 10 weeks is equivalent to 70 days.
2. For the first 57 days, Arjun eats 3 pancakes daily. So, the number of pancakes for these days is 57 × 3 = 171.
3. The remaining days are 70 − 57 = 13 days. During these days, he increases his consumption to 9 pancakes a day. Thus, he eats 13 × 9 = 117 pancakes in this period.
4. The total number of pancakes needed is 171 + 117 = 288.
5. Since 1 dozen equals 12 pancakes, the total number of dozens required is 288 ÷ 12 = 24.

The answer is 24 dozens.",24.0,1

Noah finds half as many as Winnie, and Oscar finds four dozen eggs more than Tara and James combined. How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?",12.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, find the total number of eggs hidden. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 11 dozen eggs equals 11 × 12 = 132 eggs.
2. James finds 4 eggs.
3. Tara finds 5 times as many eggs as James, which is 5 × 4 = 20 eggs.
4. Winnie finds 4 eggs less than Tara, so she finds 20 - 4 = 16 eggs.
5. Noah finds half as many eggs as Winnie, so he finds 16 ÷ 2 = 8 eggs.
6. Oscar finds four dozen eggs more than Tara and James combined. First, combine Tara's and James's finds: 20 + 4 = 24 eggs. Four dozen eggs is 4 × 12 = 48 eggs. Therefore, Oscar finds 24 + 48 = 72 eggs.
7. Now, add up all the eggs found: 4 (James) + 20 (Tara) + 16 (Winnie) + 8 (Noah) + 72 (Oscar) = 120 eggs.

How much money does he make in a week?,1539.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The first two apartment complexes each have 300 apartments. Together, they have 300 + 300 = 600 apartments.
2. The third complex is 50% bigger than the other two combined. That means it has 600 + (50% of 600) = 600 + 300 = 900 apartments.
3. In total, there are 300 + 300 + 900 = 1500 apartments.
4. Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each apartment. So, he makes 1500 × 2 = 3000 collections per week.
5. He gets paid ¥0.45 per collection. Thus, his base earnings are 3000 × ¥0.45 = ¥1350.
6. He also earns 14% on tips. This means he earns an additional 14% of his base earnings as tips: 0.14 × ¥1350 = ¥189.

Leilani ate 3 slices.
Her sister ate 12 more than Leilani, so she ate 3 + 12 = 15 slices.
Her brother ate 3 more than her sister, so he ate 15 + 3 = 18 slices.
The total number of slices eaten is 3 + 15 + 18 = 36.
Since there are 3 people, the average number of slices eaten is 36 / 3 = 12.

1. For the first 10 minutes, the cost is ¥0.7 per minute.  
  Cost for the first 10 minutes = 10 × ¥0.7 = ¥7.0.

2. After 10 minutes and until 34 minutes, the cost is ¥0.5 per minute.  
  The number of minutes from 11 to 34 = 34 - 10 = 24 minutes.  
  Cost for these 24 minutes = 24 × ¥0.5 = ¥12.0.

3. After 34 minutes, the cost is ¥0.1 per two minutes.

1. Gabriel starts with 78 beads.
2. He drops one‐third of his beads. One‑third of 78 is 78 ÷ 3 = 26 beads.
3. So, he loses 26 beads and still has 78 – 26 = 52 beads in his bag.
4. Then, he scrambles to retrieve the beads he dropped but only finds 17 of them.
5. Upon inspection, he realizes that 9 of the 17 he picked up aren’t actual beads. This means he keeps only 17 – 9 = 8 of the recovered beads.

The kernels increase to 4 times the initial popping rate in the next 22 seconds. In the final 22 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 22 seconds. After Alejandro takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. Alejandro gives 1/5 of the made popcorns to his brother Tariq. How many pieces of popcorn does Alejandro have to eat?",756.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. In the first 22 seconds, 90 kernels pop.
2. In the next 22 seconds, the amount is 3 times that from the first phase: 3 × 90 = 270 kernels.
3. In the following 22 seconds, the amount is 4 times the initial rate: 4 × 90 = 360 kernels.
