AIME,AIME,google/gemma-2-27b-it,Find the sum of all integer bases $b>9$ for which $17_{b}$ is a divisor of $97_{b}$.,70,0,,,"Here's how to solve the problem:

**Understanding Place Value**

*  In base $b$, the number $17_b$ represents $(1 \times b^1) + (7 \times b^0) = b + 7$.
* Similarly, $97_b$ represents $(9 \times b^1) + (7 \times b^0) = 9b + 7$.

**Divisibility Condition**

For $17_b$ to be a divisor of $97_b$,  $97_b$ must be divisible by $17_b$. This means:

$$9b + 7 = k(b + 7)$$

for some integer $k$.

**Solving for b**

Let's simplify the equation:

* $9b + 7 = kb + 7k$
* $9b - kb = 7k - 7$
* $b(9 - k) = 7(k - 1)$

For this equation to hold, both sides must be divisible by the same factors. Since $b$ is an integer greater than 9, we need to find values of $k$ that make $(9-k)$ a factor of $7(k-1)$.

**Finding Possible Values of k**

* **Case 1:** $9-k = 7$. This gives us $k=2$.  Substituting into the equation, we get $b(7) = 7(1)$, so $b=1$. This solution is not valid since $b>9$.

* **Case 2:** $9-k = 1$. This gives us $k=8$. Substituting into the equation, we get $b(1) = 7(7)$, so $b=49$. This solution is valid.

* **Case 3:** $9-k = -7$. This gives us $k=16$. Substituting into the equation, we get $b(-7) = 7(15)$, which has no integer solutions for $b$.

**The Answer**

The only valid integer base $b > 9$ that satisfies the condition is $b = 49$. 

Therefore, the sum of all such bases is $\boxed{49}$.",49.0,0,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

* **Case 2:** 6 players chose chocolate.
* **Case 3:** 7 players chose chocolate.
* **Case 4:** 8 players chose chocolate.
* **Case 5:** 9 players chose chocolate.

**1. Factor the Equation**

The given equation is a quadratic in two variables. We can try to factor it:

*  Notice that we can rewrite the equation as:  
   (12x² - 6y²) - xy = 0
*  Factor out a 6 from the first two terms:
   6(2x² - y²) - xy = 0
*  Recognize the difference of squares pattern:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the number of 8-digit numbers formed by the digits 1 through 8 that are divisible by 22.  

**Divisibility Rules**

* **Divisibility by 2:** A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even.
* **Divisibility by 11:** A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits at odd places and the sum of the digits at even places is either 0 or a multiple of 11.

**Applying the Rules**

1. **Even Last Digit:** Since the number must be divisible by 2, the last digit can be 2, 4, 6, or 8. There are 4 choices for the last digit.

2. **Divisibility by 11:**  Let's consider the possible arrangements of the remaining digits to satisfy the divisibility rule for 11.

   * **Case 1:** The sum of digits at odd places minus the sum of digits at even places is 0.

   * **Case 2:** The sum of digits at odd places minus the sum of digits at even places is a multiple of 11 (which is not possible with the digits 1 through 8).

3. **Counting Arrangements:** For each of the 4 choices of the last digit, we need to count the number of ways to arrange the remaining 7 digits to satisfy the divisibility rule for 11. This can be done by trying out different combinations and checking if they meet the condition.

**Calculating N**

Due to the complexity of manually checking all combinations, it's best to use a computer program or calculator to help with the counting.

AIME,AIME,google/gemma-2-27b-it,"An isosceles trapezoid has an inscribed circle tangent to each of its four sides. The radius of the circle is 3, and the area of the trapezoid is 72. Let the parallel sides of the trapezoid have lengths $r$ and $s$, with $r \neq s$. Find $r^{2}+s^{2}$.",504,5,,,"Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Understanding the Setup**

* **Isosceles Trapezoid:**  A trapezoid with two sides of equal length.
* **Inscribed Circle:** A circle that fits perfectly inside the trapezoid, touching all four sides.
* **Tangents:** The circle is tangent to each side, meaning it touches each side at exactly one point.

**2. Key Properties**

* **Incenter:** The center of the inscribed circle is called the incenter. The incenter is the point where the angle bisectors of the trapezoid intersect.
* **Inradius:** The radius of the inscribed circle is called the inradius.

**3. Using the Area**

* The area of a trapezoid is given by:  Area = (1/2) * height * (base1 + base2)
* We know the area is 72 and the inradius is 3.

**4. Finding the Height**

* The inradius is also the perpendicular distance from the incenter to each side of the trapezoid. This means the inradius is the height of the trapezoid.

**5. Setting up the Equation**

Let's call the height of the trapezoid *h*. We know *h* = 3 (the inradius).

We can now write the area equation:

72 = (1/2) * 3 * (r + s)

Simplifying:

72 = (3/2) * (r + s)

144 = 3 * (r + s)

48 = r + s

**6. Using the Pythagorean Theorem**

* Draw a perpendicular line from the incenter to one of the bases (let's say the base of length *r*). This line will bisect the base, creating two right triangles.
* The hypotenuse of each right triangle is the radius of the circle (3).
* One leg of each triangle is half the length of the base (*r/2*).
* The other leg is the height of the trapezoid (3).

Using the Pythagorean Theorem:

3² = (r/2)² + 3²

9 = (r²/4) + 9

0 = (r²/4)

r² = 0

This tells us that *r* = 0, which is not possible for a trapezoid.  

**Let's re-examine our assumptions:**

The problem statement says that *r* ≠ *s*. This means we made a mistake in assuming that the perpendicular from the incenter bisects the base *r*.

**Correcting the Approach**

* Instead of bisecting *r*, the perpendicular from the incenter will divide *r* into two segments. Let's call these segments *x* and *r - x*.

* Now, apply the Pythagorean Theorem to the right triangle formed by the inradius, *x*, and a portion of the height:

3² = x² + 3²

9 = x² + 9

x² = 0

x = 0

This means the perpendicular from the incenter coincides with one of the vertices of the trapezoid. This implies that the trapezoid is actually a rectangle.

**Solving for the Rectangle**

* Since the trapezoid is a rectangle, *r = s*.
* We know the area is 72 and the height is 3.

72 = 3 * (r + r)

72 = 6r

r = 12

* Therefore, s = 12 as well.

r² + s² = 12² + 12² = 144 + 144 = **288**",288.0,0,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Find $m+n$.",821,6,,,"Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Total Possible Arrangements**

* There are 12 letters, so there are 11 choices for the first letter of the first pair, then 10 for the second, and so on. This gives us $11\cdot10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7\cdot6$ ways to form the pairs.
* However, we've overcounted since the order within each pair doesn't matter (AB is the same as BA). We need to divide by 2 for each pair, giving us a total of $\frac{11\cdot10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7\cdot6}{2^6}$ arrangements.

**2. Arrangements Ending in G**

* For the last word to contain G, G must be the second letter of its pair. This means the first letter of that pair can be any of the 11 remaining letters.
* The other 10 letters can be paired up in the same way as before, giving us $\frac{10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7\cdot6}{2^5}$ arrangements for the remaining pairs.

**3. Calculate the Probability**

The probability of the last word containing G is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements:

$$\frac{\frac{11\cdot10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7\cdot6}{2^6} \cdot \frac{10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7\cdot6}{2^5}}{\frac{11\cdot10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7\cdot6}{2^6}} = \frac{10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7\cdot6}{2^5} = \frac{30240}{32} = 945$$

**Understanding the Problem**

We're given two equations involving complex numbers:

* **Equation 1:**  $|25 + 20i - z| = 5$ 
* **Equation 2:** $|z - 4 - k| = |z - 3i - k|$

We need to find the values of the real number *k* such that these equations have exactly one solution for *z*.

**Solving the Equations**

* **Equation 1:** This equation represents all complex numbers *z* that are a distance of 5 from the complex number 25 + 20*i*. This describes a circle in the complex plane.

* **Equation 2:** This equation states that the distance from *z* to (4 + *k*) is equal to the distance from *z* to (3*i* + *k*). This describes the set of all points that are equidistant from these two points. This is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment connecting (4 + *k*) and (3*i* + *k*).

**Finding the Solution**

For the system to have exactly one solution, the circle from Equation 1 must intersect the perpendicular bisector from Equation 2 at exactly one point.

1. **Visualize:** Imagine the circle and the perpendicular bisector in the complex plane.

2. **Intersection:** The perpendicular bisector will intersect the circle at most two points. To have only one solution, the circle and the perpendicular bisector must be tangent to each other.

3. **Tangent Condition:** For tangency, the distance from the center of the circle to the perpendicular bisector must be equal to the radius of the circle.

**Calculating k**

Let's calculate the necessary distances:

* **Center of the circle:** 25 + 20*i*
* **Radius of the circle:** 5

Find $a+b+c$.",62,8,,,"Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Rotation and Parametric Equations**

Rotating a curve around the origin can be handled using parametric equations.  Let's represent the original parabola $y = x^2 - 4$ parametrically:

*  $x = t$
*  $y = t^2 - 4$

To rotate this counterclockwise by 60 degrees, we use the following rotation matrix:

```
[ cos(60)  -sin(60) ]
[ sin(60)   cos(60) ]
```

Multiplying the original parametric equations by this matrix gives us the parametric equations for the rotated parabola:

*  $x' = t \cos(60) - (t^2 - 4) \sin(60) = \frac{1}{2}t - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}(t^2 - 4)$
*  $y' = t \sin(60) + (t^2 - 4) \cos(60) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t + \frac{1}{2}(t^2 - 4)$

**2. Finding the Intersection**

The intersection point will have the same $x$ and $y$ coordinates in both the original and rotated parabolas.  We need to solve the following system of equations:

*  $t^2 - 4 = \frac{1}{2}t - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}(t^2 - 4)$
*  $t^2 - 4 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t + \frac{1}{2}(t^2 - 4)$

Simplifying these equations, we get:

*  $\frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{2}t^2 - \frac{1}{2}t - 4 + 2\sqrt{3} = 0$
*  $\frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2}t^2 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t = 0$

The second equation is easier to solve. Factoring out a $t/2$, we get:

*  $t (2 - \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{3}t) = 0$

This gives us two solutions: $t = 0$ and $t = \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}$.

We discard $t=0$ because it corresponds to the vertex of the parabola, not a point in the fourth quadrant.

**3. Finding the y-coordinate**

Substitute $t = \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}$ into the equation for $y$ in the original parabola:

*  $y = \left(\frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 - 4 = \frac{4 - 4\sqrt{3} + 3}{3} - 4 = \frac{7 - 4\sqrt{3}}{3} - 4 = \frac{7 - 4\sqrt{3} - 12}{3} = \frac{-5 - 4\sqrt{3}}{3}$

**4. The Answer**

Therefore, the $y$-coordinate of the intersection point is $\frac{-5 - 4\sqrt{3}}{3}$.  Matching this to the form $\frac{a-\sqrt{b}}{c}$, we have $a = -5$, $b = 48$, and $c = 3$.

* **Rows:** Each row must contain all nine digits.
* **Blocks:** Each 3x3 block must contain all nine digits.

**Solution Approach**

1. **Focus on the Blocks:** Since each 3x3 block must contain all nine digits, we can treat each block as a mini-Sudoku.

2. **Permutations within Blocks:**  There are 9! (9 factorial) ways to arrange the digits 1 through 9 within a single block.

3. **Combining Blocks:** We have three blocks.  Since the arrangement of blocks doesn't matter, we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange the three blocks, which is 3! (3 factorial).

4. **Total Arrangements:** The total number of arrangements is:

   (9! / 3!) * (9! / 3!) * (9! / 3!)

**Calculation**

* 9! = 362,880
* 3! = 6

Therefore, the total number of arrangements is:

(362,880 / 6) * (362,880 / 6) * (362,880 / 6) = 60,480 * 60,480 * 60,480

**1. Understanding the Function**

The function  *f(x)* is a piecewise linear function that repeats every 4 units.  It looks like a sawtooth wave.

**2. Finding the Intersection Points**

We need to find the points where the parabola *x = 34y²* intersects the sawtooth function *f(x)*. To do this, we'll substitute the expression for *x* from the parabola into the definition of *f(x)*:

* **Case 1: -1 ≤ 34y² < 1** 
   In this case, *f(x) = x = 34y²*.  Solving for *y*, we get:
   *y² = x/34*
   *y = ±√(x/34)*
   Since -1 ≤ 34y² < 1, we have -1/34 ≤ y² < 1/34. This means -1/√34 ≤ y ≤ 1/√34.

* **Case 2: 1 ≤ 34y² < 3**
   In this case, *f(x) = 2 - x = 2 - 34y²*. Solving for *y*, we get:
   *34y² + y - 2 = 0*
   This is a quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions for *y*.

* **Case 3: 3 ≤ 34y² < 7**
   This case and subsequent cases follow a similar pattern. We substitute *x = 34y²* into the appropriate piece of the piecewise function and solve for *y*.

**3. Summing the y-coordinates**

After finding the *y*-coordinates of all the intersection points, we simply add them up.

The sum of the *y*-coordinates will likely be a messy expression. We need to simplify it as much as possible to get it in the form  *(a + b√c) / d*.

The area of this finite region can be expressed in the form $a\sqrt{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $b$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a+b$.",510,11,,,"Here's a solution to the problem:

**1. Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with a plane in 3D space defined by the equation  *x + y + z = 75*.  Within this plane, we have a set of points that satisfy a system of inequalities:

* *x - yz < y - zx*
* *y - zx < z - xy*

These inequalities define three separate regions within the plane. We need to find the region with finite area and calculate its area.

**2. Simplifying the Inequalities**

Let's rearrange the inequalities to make them easier to work with:

* *x + zx - y - yz < 0*
* *y + xy - z - zx < 0*

**3. Geometric Interpretation**

The inequalities now resemble the form of a hyperbola.  Think about the equation *xy = k*. This represents a hyperbola in the *xy*-plane.  Our inequalities are similar, but with an additional *z* term.

Since we're working within the plane *x + y + z = 75*, we can express *z* in terms of *x* and *y*:

* *z = 75 - x - y*

Substitute this into the inequalities and simplify. You'll end up with inequalities that define regions within the *xy*-plane.

**4. Finding the Finite Region**

The three regions defined by the inequalities will likely be separated by lines or curves.  One of these regions will be bounded, meaning it has a finite area.

**5. Calculating the Area**

To find the area of the finite region, you'll need to:

* **Determine the boundaries:** Find the equations of the lines or curves that enclose the finite region.
* **Set up an integral:** Use a double integral to calculate the area enclosed by the boundaries.

**6. Expressing the Answer**

After calculating the area, express it in the form *a√b*, where *a* and *b* are positive integers and *b* is not divisible by the square of any prime.

**7. Finding a + b**

Finally, add *a* and *b* to get your answer.

Find the expected number of regions into which these 27 line segments divide the disk.",204,12,,,"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

Imagine a pizza cut into four quarters. Alex is drawing more lines across the pizza, randomly connecting points on opposite quarters. We want to know how many slices we expect to end up with.

**Key Idea:  Each New Line Creates New Regions**

* The initial four quadrants are our starting point (4 regions).
* Every time Alex draws a new line, it intersects existing lines, creating new regions.

**Calculating the Expected Number of Regions**

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **First Line:** The first line divides the disk into 5 regions.

2. **Second Line:** The second line will intersect the first line, creating 2 new regions. So, we now have 5 + 2 = 7 regions.

3. **Third Line:** The third line will intersect the previous two lines, creating 3 new regions. We now have 7 + 3 = 10 regions.

4. **General Pattern:**  Notice the pattern: each new line creates a number of new regions equal to the number of lines it intersects.

5. **Expected Value:** Since the lines are drawn randomly, we can't know exactly how many intersections each new line will have. However, we can calculate the *expected* number of intersections.

* **Intersection Probability:** The probability that a new line intersects a specific existing line is roughly proportional to the length of the existing line. Since all lines are drawn across the disk, we can assume a roughly equal probability of intersection for each existing line.

* **Expected Intersections:** With 25 new lines, we expect each new line to intersect, on average, about half of the existing lines (25/2 = 12.5).

* **Expected New Regions:**  Each new line creates a number of new regions equal to the number of intersections plus one. So, on average, each new line creates 12.5 + 1 = 13.5 new regions.

6. **Total Expected Regions:**

   * Start with the initial 4 regions.
   * Add the expected new regions from each of the 25 lines: 25 lines * 13.5 new regions/line = 337.5

   * Total expected regions: 4 + 337.5 = 341.5

**Answer:**

Since we can't have half a region, we round to the nearest whole number. The expected number of regions is **\boxed{342}**.",342.0,0,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Find $m+n+p$.",60,13,,,"Here's a solution to the problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're given a pentagon and a function that calculates the sum of distances from a point to each vertex. Our goal is to find the point that minimizes this sum. This type of problem often involves geometric intuition and the use of inequalities.

**Solution**

1. **Geometric Insight:**

   * Notice that the angles at vertices B and E are 60 degrees. This suggests we might be able to use equilateral triangles or 30-60-90 triangles in our solution.

2. **Constructing a Key Point:**

   * Let's construct a point $F$ such that $\triangle ABF$ is equilateral. This means $AF = AB = 14$ and $\angle AFB = 60^\circ$.

3. **Using the Triangle Inequality:**

   * Consider any point $X$ in the plane. By the Triangle Inequality:
      * $AX + XF \ge AF = 14$

4. **Minimizing the Sum:**

   * We want to minimize $f(X) = AX + BX + CX + DX + EX$.  Since $AX + XF \ge 14$, we can say:
      * $f(X) = AX + BX + CX + DX + EX \ge XF + BX + CX + DX + EX$

   * Now, focus on minimizing $XF + BX + CX + DX + EX$.  

5. **Strategic Placement of X:**

   * To minimize this sum, point $X$ should be as close as possible to all the vertices. Since we have a 60-degree angle at $B$, it's natural to try placing $X$ on line segment $BF$.

6. **Finding the Optimal X:**

   * Let $X$ be a point on $BF$ such that $BX = BF$. This makes $\triangle BFX$ equilateral.

7. **Calculating the Minimum:**

   * With this placement of $X$, we have:
      * $f(X) = XF + BX + CX + DX + EX = 14 + 14 + CX + DX + EX$

   * To minimize this further, we'd ideally want $X$ to be as close to $C$, $D$, and $E$ as possible. However, due to the pentagon's shape, we can't get $X$ perfectly aligned with these vertices.

8. **Approximation and Refinement:**

   * At this point, you'd likely need to use coordinate geometry or other techniques to find the precise location of $X$ on $BF$ that minimizes $f(X)$. This involves setting up equations based on the distances and using calculus or optimization methods.

**Important Notes:**

* The problem statement asks for the minimum value of $f(X)$ in the form $m + n\sqrt{p}$. This suggests that the optimal solution might involve a radical expression.
* The final steps of finding the exact minimum value and expressing it in the desired form are quite involved and require careful calculations.

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the number of triples $(a, b, c)$ where each number is less than or equal to $3^6 = 729$, and their sum of cubes is divisible by $3^7 = 2187$.

**Key Idea: Modular Arithmetic**

The key to solving this problem is to use modular arithmetic.  We'll work modulo $3^7$.

* **Fact:** If $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$, then $a^3 \equiv b^3 \pmod{m}$.

**Simplifying the Problem**

Let's consider the possible remainders when a positive integer less than or equal to $729$ is divided by $2187$. Since $2187 = 3^7$, the possible remainders are of the form $3^k$ where $0 \le k \le 6$.

We can classify the triples $(a, b, c)$ based on the remainders of $a^3$, $b^3$, and $c^3$ when divided by $2187$:

* **Case 1:** $a^3 \equiv 0 \pmod{2187}$, $b^3 \equiv 0 \pmod{2187}$, $c^3 \equiv 0 \pmod{2187}$
   This means $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all divisible by $3^7$. There are $\left(\frac{729}{2187}\right)^3 = 0$ such triples.

* **Case 2:**  Exactly one of $a^3$, $b^3$, or $c^3$ is congruent to 0 modulo 2187.
   Without loss of generality, let $a^3 \equiv 0 \pmod{2187}$. Then $b^3$ and $c^3$ must have remainders that add up to 0 modulo 2187. There are 7 choices for the remainder of $b^3$ modulo 2187, and for each choice, there's a unique choice for the remainder of $c^3$ to make the sum divisible by 2187. This gives us $7 \cdot 729 \cdot 729$ triples.

* **Case 3:** Exactly two of $a^3$, $b^3$, or $c^3$ are congruent to 0 modulo 2187.
   This case is similar to Case 2. There are 7 choices for the remainder of the non-zero cube modulo 2187, and for each choice, there's a unique choice for the other non-zero cube. This gives us $7 \cdot 729 \cdot 729$ triples.

* **Case 4:** None of $a^3$, $b^3$, or $c^3$ are congruent to 0 modulo 2187.
   In this case, the remainders of $a^3$, $b^3$, and $c^3$ modulo 2187 must add up to 0.  We can use a similar counting argument as in the previous cases.

**Calculating the Total Number of Triples**

You'll need to carefully count the triples in each case and add them up. Remember to take the remainders modulo 1000 at each step to avoid dealing with very large numbers.

* AF = 73

Our goal is to find the area of triangle BGE. To do this, we need its base and height.

* **Base:**  We can use BG as the base of the triangle.

* **Height:** The height of the triangle is the perpendicular distance from point E to line BG.

**4.  Finding the Height**

This is the trickiest part.  We need to use the given lengths and some geometry principles to find the height. Here's one approach:

* **Consider triangles BCG and DGE:** These triangles share a common angle at G.

* **Use the Law of Cosines:** We can use the Law of Cosines to find the angles in these triangles.

* **Find the height:** Once we know the angles, we can use trigonometry (sine or cosine) to find the height of triangle BGE.

**5. Calculate the Area**

Once you have the base (BG) and the height of triangle BGE, use the formula for the area of a triangle:

Area = (1/2) * base * height

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find all positive integers 'n' that satisfy a specific divisibility condition.  The condition is that the expression (n + 2) must divide the product 3(n + 3)(n² + 9).

**Using Modular Arithmetic**

Modular arithmetic is a powerful tool for divisibility problems. The statement ""a divides b"" is equivalent to saying ""b is congruent to 0 modulo a"". We can write this as:

b ≡ 0 (mod a)

Let's apply this to our problem:

* We want to find 'n' such that: 3(n + 3)(n² + 9) ≡ 0 (mod n + 2)

**Simplifying the Expression**

To make the modular arithmetic easier, let's try to simplify the expression 3(n + 3)(n² + 9):

* Expand the product: 3(n + 3)(n² + 9) = 3(n³ + 3n² + 9n + 27) = 3n³ + 9n² + 27n + 81

Now we have:

* 3n³ + 9n² + 27n + 81 ≡ 0 (mod n + 2)

**Using the Remainder Theorem**

The Remainder Theorem in polynomial division states that when a polynomial, p(x), is divided by (x - a), the remainder is p(a).

Let's apply this to our problem.  We want to find the remainder when (3n³ + 9n² + 27n + 81) is divided by (n + 2). According to the Remainder Theorem, this remainder is:

* 3(-2)³ + 9(-2)² + 27(-2) + 81 = -24 + 36 - 54 + 81 = 39

**Solving the Congruence**

We now have:

* 39 ≡ 0 (mod n + 2)

This means (n + 2) must be a divisor of 39. The divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, and 39.

Therefore, the possible values for n are:

* n + 2 = 1  =>  n = -1 (Not a positive integer)
* n + 2 = 3  =>  n = 1
* n + 2 = 13 =>  n = 11
* n + 2 = 39 =>  n = 37

**1. Focus on One Square**

Consider just one of the unit squares. There are  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways to choose which 2 sides will be red (the other 2 will automatically be blue).

**2.  The Chain Reaction**

* The color of the sides of one square directly influences the possible colorings of its neighboring squares. 
* For example, if the top side of a square is red, the bottom side of the square above it *must* be red.

**3.  Counting the Possibilities**

Let's analyze the possibilities systematically:

* **Case 1: Top Left Square**

   There are 15 ways to color the top-left square.  Each of these choices fixes the colors of some sides of the other squares.

* **Case 2: Subsequent Squares**

   For each of the remaining squares, the choices for coloring are restricted by the colors of the already-colored adjacent sides. You'll need to carefully consider the possibilities for each square, taking into account the restrictions.

Be careful not to overcount colorings that are essentially the same due to rotations or reflections.

* We have a triangle ABC with given angles.
* D, E, and F are midpoints of the sides.
* The circumcircle of triangle DEF intersects the sides of triangle ABC at G, H, and J.

**Key Observations**

1. **Angles in Triangle DEF:** Since D, E, and F are midpoints, triangle DEF is similar to triangle ABC. Therefore, the angles of triangle DEF are half the angles of triangle ABC:
   * ∠DEF = ∠ABC/2 = 30°
   * ∠EFG = ∠ACB/2 = 18°
   * ∠FDE = ∠BAC/2 = 42°

2. **Inscribed Angles:** An inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. This will be crucial for finding the arc measures.

**Calculations**

* **Arc DE:**  ∠DFE is an inscribed angle intercepting arc DE. Therefore, 
   * ∠DFE = 1/2 * arc DE
   * arc DE = 2 * ∠DFE = 2 * 42° = 84°

* **Arc HJ:** ∠HJG is an inscribed angle intercepting arc HJ.
   * ∠HJG = 1/2 * arc HJ

* **Equal Areas:** The fact that triangles $\triangle DGF$ and $\triangle CHG$ have equal areas will be crucial.

**3. Using Similar Triangles**

Let $x = EF = GH$ and $y = FG = EH$. From the similarity of triangles, we have:

* $\frac{BF}{BE} = \frac{BC}{BF} \Rightarrow BF^2 = BE \cdot BC$

Since $BC$ is a diameter of $\omega_2$, $BC = 2 \cdot 15 = 30$.

The greedy algorithm fails when there's a more efficient way to make change using fewer coins. This often happens when the target amount can be expressed as a sum of smaller coins in a way that the greedy algorithm wouldn't consider.

**Finding the Successful Cases**

It's difficult to directly find all the cases where the greedy algorithm succeeds. Instead, we can find the cases where it fails and subtract from the total number of possible values.

Here's a strategy:

1. **Identify Failure Patterns:** Look for patterns in the values of *N* where the greedy algorithm is guaranteed to fail. For example, consider values that are multiples of 5 but not multiples of 25.

2. **Count Failure Cases:** Count the number of values between 1 and 1000 that fit the failure patterns you identified.

3. **Subtract from Total:** Subtract the number of failure cases from 1000 to find the number of success cases.

**Let's start identifying failure patterns:**

* **Multiples of 5 but not 25:** The greedy algorithm will use a lot of 1-cent coins in these cases, while a more efficient solution might use more 5-cent coins.

* **Other Patterns:** There might be other patterns, but they become more complex to identify.

**Important Note:**

This problem requires careful analysis and potentially some programming to efficiently count the failure cases. It's a good example of a problem where a brute-force approach might be too time-consuming, and a more strategic approach is needed.

For $ t $ of these $ n $ values of $ x $, the graph of $ y = f(x) $ is tangent to the $ x $-axis. Find $ n + t $.",149,23,,,"Here's how to solve the problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Finding the zeros:** We need to find all the values of *x* between 0 and 2π where the sine function equals zero.
* **Tangent to the x-axis:** This means the derivative of the function will also be zero at those points.

**Solution**

1. **Zeros of the sine function:**

   The sine function is zero at multiples of π.  So, we need to find the values of *x* for which:

   7π * sin(5x) = kπ, where k is an integer.

   This simplifies to:

   sin(5x) = k/7

2. **Solving for x:**

   For each integer value of *k* from -7 to 7 (since the sine function has a range of -1 to 1), we need to solve the equation sin(5x) = k/7. This will give us multiple solutions for *x* within the interval 0 < *x* < 2π.

3. **Finding tangent points:**

   To determine where the graph is tangent to the x-axis, we need to find the derivative of *f(x)*:

   *f'(x) = 35π cos(7π sin(5x)) * cos(5x)*

   We need to find the values of *x* where both *f(x) = 0* and *f'(x) = 0*.

4. **Counting n and t:**

   *  *n* will be the total number of solutions for *x* found in step 2.
   *  *t* will be the number of those solutions that also satisfy *f'(x) = 0*.

5. **Calculating n + t:**

   Add the values of *n* and *t* to get the final answer.

**Important Notes:**

* This problem involves a lot of trigonometric calculations. You may need to use a calculator or computer to help you find the solutions for *x*.
* Be careful with the interval 0 < *x* < 2π. Make sure your solutions fall within this range.

Let $ N $ be the number of subsets of 16 chairs that could be selected. Find the remainder when $ N $ is divided by 1000.,907,24,,,"Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Visualize the Problem**

Imagine the 16 chairs as a line.  We need to choose 8 chairs where no two chosen chairs are adjacent.

**2. Think in Terms of Gaps**

Instead of focusing on the chairs themselves, think about the gaps between them. Since we can't have two people sitting together, there must be at least one empty chair between any two people.

* There are 15 gaps between the 16 chairs.

**3.  Represent the Problem with Stars and Bars**

We can represent the chosen chairs with stars (*) and the gaps with bars (|). For example:

*|*|***||*|*||*||*|*

This represents 3 people sitting in the first group, then a gap, then 3 people, and so on.

**4.  Set up the Equation**

We need to find the number of ways to arrange 8 stars (people) and 7 bars (gaps) to satisfy the condition. This is a classic ""stars and bars"" problem. The total number of arrangements is:

(8 + 7) choose 7 = 15 choose 7

**5. Calculate and Find the Remainder**

Calculate 15 choose 7 using the binomial coefficient formula or a calculator:

15 choose 7 = 6435

Finally, find the remainder when 6435 is divided by 1000:

6435 divided by 1000 leaves a remainder of **435**.

**1. Visualize the Problem**

Imagine a regular 24-gon.  We want to connect pairs of vertices with segments of equal length, ensuring every vertex is used exactly once.

**2.  Choosing the First Segment**

* We have 24 choices for the first vertex of our segment.
* Once we've chosen the first vertex, we have 23 choices for the second vertex.

This seems like there are $24 \times 23 = 552$ ways to choose the first segment. However, we've overcounted!

**3. Accounting for Overcounting**

* Since the segments have equal length, swapping the order of the two vertices in our first segment doesn't create a new arrangement. We've counted each segment twice (once for each order).

Therefore, there are actually $\frac{24 \times 23}{2} = 276$ ways to choose the first segment.

**4. Choosing Subsequent Segments**

* After choosing the first segment, we have 22 vertices remaining.  We need to choose a pair for our second segment. There are $\frac{22 \times 21}{2} = 231$ ways to do this.

* For the third segment, we have $\frac{20 \times 19}{2} = 190$ choices, and so on.

**5. The Final Calculation**

The total number of ways to draw the 12 segments is:

 $$276 \times 231 \times 190 \times 153 \times 120 \times 91 \times 66 \times 45 \times 28 \times 15 \times 6 \times 1$$

This is a very large number!  You can use a calculator to find the exact value.

**6. Simplifying (Optional)**

You can simplify this calculation by recognizing that it's a factorial:

$$24! / (12! \times 2^{12})$$

This formula represents the number of ways to arrange 24 objects, divided by the number of ways to arrange the 12 pairs (since the order within each pair doesn't matter).

**Understanding the Problem**

We're given an 11-sided polygon with specific properties related to its area, angles, and perimeter. Our goal is to find the value of  $A_1A_2 + A_1A_{11}$ and express it in the desired form.

**Solution**

1. **Area and Law of Cosines:**

   * The area of a triangle with sides $a$, $b$, and $c$ and angle $C$ opposite side $c$ is given by:
     
     Area = $\frac{1}{2}ab\sin C$

   * We know the area of each triangle $A_iA_1A_{i+1}$ is 1 and $\cos(\angle A_iA_1A_{i+1}) = \frac{12}{13}$. Let's denote $A_1A_i = a_i$, $A_1A_{i+1} = a_{i+1}$, and $A_iA_{i+1} = b_i$.

   * Using the Law of Cosines:
     
     $b_i^2 = a_i^2 + a_{i+1}^2 - 2a_ia_{i+1}\cdot \frac{12}{13}$

2. **Expressing Sides in Terms of Area:**

   * From the area formula:
     
     $1 = \frac{1}{2}a_ib_{i}\sin(\angle A_iA_1A_{i+1})$

   * We can express $\sin(\angle A_iA_1A_{i+1})$ in terms of $\cos(\angle A_iA_1A_{i+1})$:

     $\sin(\angle A_iA_1A_{i+1}) = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2(\angle A_iA_1A_{i+1})} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{144}{169}} = \frac{5}{13}$

   * Substituting back into the area formula:

     $1 = \frac{1}{2}a_ib_{i} \cdot \frac{5}{13}$

     $b_i = \frac{26}{5a_i}$

3. **Using the Perimeter:**

   * The perimeter of the polygon is 20:

     $a_2 + a_3 + ... + a_{11} + a_1 + a_2 = 20$

   * We can simplify this using the expressions for $b_i$ from step 2.

4. **Solving the System of Equations:**

   * We now have a system of equations involving the side lengths $a_i$. Solving this system will allow us to find the values of $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_{11}$.

5. **Calculating  $A_1A_2 + A_1A_{11}$:**

   * Once we have the values of $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_{11}$, we can directly calculate $A_1A_2 + A_1A_{11}$.

6. **Expressing the Answer in the Desired Form:**

   * Simplify the expression for $A_1A_2 + A_1A_{11}$ to match the form $\frac{m\sqrt{n} - p}{q}$.

**Note:** The actual calculations involved in solving the system of equations and simplifying the final expression can be quite tedious.

**Key Observation:**

The given recurrence relation has a special property. Let's define a new sequence $y_k = x_k^2$.  Then:

* $y_1 = x_1^2 = \left(\frac{25}{11}\right)^2 = \frac{625}{121}$

* $y_{k+1} = x_{k+1}^2 = \left(\frac{1}{3} \left( x_k + \frac{1}{x_k} - 1 \right)\right)^2$

Expanding the right side and simplifying, we get:

* $y_{k+1} = \frac{1}{9} \left( x_k^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{x_k^2} - 2x_k - \frac{2}{x_k} + 1 \right)$

* $y_{k+1} = \frac{1}{9} \left( y_k + 3 - 2x_k - \frac{2}{x_k} \right)$

* $y_{k+1} = \frac{1}{9} \left( y_k + 3 - 2\sqrt{y_k} \right)$  (since $x_k = \sqrt{y_k}$)

**Solving the Simplified Recurrence:**

Now we have a recurrence relation for $y_k$ which is easier to work with. Let's try to find a pattern:

1. **Calculate the first few terms:**

   * $y_2 = \frac{1}{9} \left( \frac{625}{121} + 3 - 2\sqrt{\frac{625}{121}} \right)$
   * $y_3 = \frac{1}{9} \left( y_2 + 3 - 2\sqrt{y_2} \right)$
   * ... and so on

2. **Look for a pattern:**

   You'll notice that the terms $y_k$ seem to be converging to a specific value.

3. **Find the limit:**

   If the sequence converges, let's say to the limit $L$. Then:

   * $L = \frac{1}{9} (L + 3 - 2\sqrt{L})$

   Solve this equation for $L$. You'll find a positive solution.

4. **Relate back to x_k:**

   Since $x_k = \sqrt{y_k}$, the limit of $x_k$ as $k$ approaches infinity will be the square root of the limit $L$ you found.

**Finding m + n:**

* Calculate the limit $L$ and find its square root. This will be the value of $x_{2025}$.

* Express the square root of $L$ as a fraction $\frac{m}{n}$ in lowest terms.

**2. Key Observations**

* **Equilateral Triangle:** Triangle KLC is equilateral, so all its angles are 60 degrees.
* **Right Angles:**  Angles AKB, ALC, and BKC are all right angles because AK = AL = BK = CL = 14.

**3. Finding Areas**

* **Area of Triangle KLC:** The area of an equilateral triangle with side length *s* is  (√3/4) * *s*². So, the area of triangle KLC is (√3/4) * 14² = 49√3.

defined over the positive real numbers achieves its minimum value at exactly two positive real numbers $ x $. Find the sum of these three values of $ k $.",240,29,,,"Here's a solution to the problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find three specific values of  'k' that make the function f(x) have two distinct minimum points within the domain of positive real numbers.

**Key Observations**

* **Rational Function:** The function f(x) is a rational function, meaning it's a ratio of two polynomials.
* **Zeros:** The numerator has zeros at x = 18, 72, 98, and k. These are points where the function crosses the x-axis.
* **Vertical Asymptote:** The denominator has a zero at x = 0, creating a vertical asymptote.

**Strategy**

1. **Derivative:** Find the derivative of f(x) to identify critical points (where the function might have a minimum or maximum).

2. **Second Derivative Test:** Use the second derivative to determine if the critical points are indeed minima.

3. **Two Minima:**  We need to find values of 'k' that result in exactly two critical points being minima.

**Solution**

1. **Derivative:**

   Using the quotient rule, the derivative of f(x) is:

   ```
   f'(x) = [(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k)]' * x - (x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k) * 1 / x^2
   ```

   This expression is quite complex, but we're primarily interested in where it equals zero (critical points).

2. **Critical Points:**

   Setting f'(x) = 0 and solving for x will give us the critical points. This will likely involve factoring and solving a polynomial equation.

3. **Second Derivative Test:**

   Calculate the second derivative, f''(x).  Evaluate f''(x) at each critical point found in step 2.

   * If f''(x) > 0 at a critical point, it's a local minimum.
   * If f''(x) < 0 at a critical point, it's a local maximum.

4. **Finding 'k':**

   Experiment with different values of 'k' and repeat steps 2 and 3. The goal is to find three values of 'k' that result in exactly two critical points being local minima.

* This problem involves a lot of algebraic manipulation. Be careful with signs and simplification.
* You might need to use numerical methods or graphing calculators to help visualize the function and find the critical points.
