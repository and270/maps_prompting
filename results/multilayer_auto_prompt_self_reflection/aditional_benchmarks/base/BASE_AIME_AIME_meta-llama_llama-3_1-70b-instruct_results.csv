AIME,AIME,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,Find the sum of all integer bases $b>9$ for which $17_{b}$ is a divisor of $97_{b}$.,70,0,,,"## Step 1: Understand the problem
We are asked to find the sum of all integer bases $b>9$ for which $17_{b}$ is a divisor of $97_{b}$. This means we need to find the values of $b$ where the representation of the number $17$ in base $b$ divides the representation of the number $97$ in base $b$.

## Step 2: Convert to base 10
First, let's convert $17_{b}$ and $97_{b}$ to base 10 to make the problem more manageable. $17_{b}$ in base 10 is $1 \times b + 7$, and $97_{b}$ in base 10 is $9 \times b + 7$.

## Step 3: Determine divisibility condition
For $17_{b}$ to be a divisor of $97_{b}$, the base 10 representation of $97_{b}$ must be divisible by the base 10 representation of $17_{b}$. This means $(9b + 7) / (b + 7)$ must be an integer.

## Step 4: Solve for b
To find the values of $b$ that satisfy the condition, we can solve the equation $(9b + 7) / (b + 7) = k$, where $k$ is an integer. This simplifies to $9b + 7 = k(b + 7)$.

## Step 5: Rearrange the equation
Rearranging the equation, we get $9b + 7 = kb + 7k$, which simplifies to $9b - kb = 7k - 7$.

## Step 6: Factor out b
Factoring out $b$, we get $b(9 - k) = 7(k - 1)$.

## Step 7: Solve for b
Dividing both sides by $(9 - k)$, we get $b = 7(k - 1) / (9 - k)$.

## Step 8: Find integer solutions for b
We need to find integer values of $b$ that satisfy the equation. Since $b > 9$, we can try different values of $k$ to find corresponding integer values of $b$.

## Step 9: Check for valid values of b
We can check for valid values of $b$ by plugging in different values of $k$ and seeing if $b$ is an integer greater than 9.

## Step 10: Sum the valid values of b
Once we find the valid values of $b$, we can sum them up to get the final answer.

## Step 11: Check for k = 2
If $k = 2$, then $b = 7(2 - 1) / (9 - 2) = 7 / 7 = 1$, which is not valid since $b > 9$.

## Step 12: Check for k = 3
If $k = 3$, then $b = 7(3 - 1) / (9 - 3) = 14 / 6 = 7/3$, which is not an integer.

## Step 13: Check for k = 4
If $k = 4$, then $b = 7(4 - 1) / (9 - 4) = 21 / 5$, which is not an integer.

## Step 14: Check for k = 5
If $k = 5$, then $b = 7(5 - 1) / (9 - 5) = 28 / 4 = 7$, which is not valid since $b > 9$.

## Step 15: Check for k = 6
If $k = 6$, then $b = 7(6 - 1) / (9 - 6) = 35 / 3$, which is not an integer.

## Step 16: Check for k = 7
If $k = 7$, then $b = 7(7 - 1) / (9 - 7) = 42 / 2 = 21$, which is a valid value of $b$.

## Step 17: Check for k = 8
If $k = 8$, then $b = 7(8 - 1) / (9 - 8) = 49 / 1 = 49$, which is a valid value of $b$.

## Step 18: Sum the valid values of b
The sum of the valid values of $b$ is $21 + 49 = 70$.

Each player had a singlescoop cone of chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry ice cream. At least one player chose each flavor, and the number of players who chose chocolate was greater than the number of players who chose vanilla, which was greater than the number of players who chose strawberry. Let $N$ be the number of different assignments of flavors to players that meet these conditions. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by 1000.",16,2,,,"## Step 1: Understand the problem and constraints
We have 9 players who can choose from 3 flavors of ice cream: chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. Each player must choose one flavor, and at least one player must choose each flavor. Additionally, the number of players who choose chocolate must be greater than the number who choose vanilla, which must be greater than the number who choose strawberry.

## Step 2: Determine the possible distributions of flavors
Given the constraints, we can start by determining the possible distributions of flavors among the 9 players. Let's denote the number of players who choose chocolate as $c$, vanilla as $v$, and strawberry as $s$. We know that $c > v > s$ and $c + v + s = 9$.

## Step 3: Enumerate the possible distributions
We can enumerate the possible distributions of flavors by considering the possible values of $c$, $v$, and $s$ that satisfy the constraints. We can start with the maximum possible value of $c$ and work our way down, ensuring that $v$ and $s$ are also valid.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways for each distribution
For each possible distribution of flavors, we need to calculate the number of ways to assign the flavors to the 9 players. This can be done using combinations, as we need to choose the players for each flavor.

## Step 5: Sum up the total number of assignments
Once we have calculated the number of ways for each distribution, we can sum up the total number of assignments that meet the conditions.

## Step 6: Calculate the remainder when divided by 1000
Finally, we need to calculate the remainder when the total number of assignments is divided by 1000.

## Step 7: Enumerate and calculate the number of ways for each distribution
We can have the following distributions: (5, 3, 1), (5, 2, 2), (4, 4, 1), (4, 3, 2). For each distribution, we can calculate the number of ways to assign the flavors using combinations.

## Step 8: Calculate the number of ways for (5, 3, 1)
For the distribution (5, 3, 1), we can choose 5 players for chocolate in $\binom{9}{5}$ ways, then choose 3 players for vanilla in $\binom{4}{3}$ ways, and the remaining player gets strawberry. This gives us $\binom{9}{5} \times \binom{4}{3} = 126 \times 4 = 504$ ways.

## Step 9: Calculate the number of ways for (5, 2, 2)
For the distribution (5, 2, 2), we can choose 5 players for chocolate in $\binom{9}{5}$ ways, then choose 2 players for vanilla in $\binom{4}{2}$ ways, and the remaining 2 players get strawberry. This gives us $\binom{9}{5} \times \binom{4}{2} = 126 \times 6 = 756$ ways.

## Step 10: Calculate the number of ways for (4, 4, 1)
For the distribution (4, 4, 1), we can choose 4 players for chocolate in $\binom{9}{4}$ ways, then choose 4 players for vanilla in $\binom{5}{4}$ ways, and the remaining player gets strawberry. This gives us $\binom{9}{4} \times \binom{5}{4} = 126 \times 5 = 630$ ways.

## Step 11: Calculate the number of ways for (4, 3, 2)
For the distribution (4, 3, 2), we can choose 4 players for chocolate in $\binom{9}{4}$ ways, then choose 3 players for vanilla in $\binom{5}{3}$ ways, and the remaining 2 players get strawberry. This gives us $\binom{9}{4} \times \binom{5}{3} = 126 \times 10 = 1260$ ways.

The total number of assignments is $504 + 756 + 630 + 1260 = 3150$.

The equation $12x^{2}-xy-6y^{2}=0$ can be factored as $(4x+3y)(3x-2y)=0$.

## Step 2: Solve for the first factor
Setting the first factor equal to zero, we get $4x+3y=0$. Solving for $y$, we find $y=-\frac{4}{3}x$. Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, $x$ must be a multiple of $3$ to ensure $y$ is an integer.

## Step 3: Find the range of x for the first factor
Given that $x$ is between $-100$ and $100$, inclusive, and $x$ must be a multiple of $3$, we can find the number of possible values of $x$. The multiples of $3$ in this range are $-99, -96,..., 96, 99$, for a total of $66$ possible values of $x$.

## Step 4: Solve for the second factor
Setting the second factor equal to zero, we get $3x-2y=0$. Solving for $y$, we find $y=\frac{3}{2}x$. Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, $x$ must be a multiple of $2$ to ensure $y$ is an integer.

## Step 5: Find the range of x for the second factor
Given that $x$ is between $-100$ and $100$, inclusive, and $x$ must be a multiple of $2$, we can find the number of possible values of $x$. The multiples of $2$ in this range are $-100, -98,..., 98, 100$, for a total of $101$ possible values of $x$.

## Step 6: Find the common solutions
However, we need to consider that some solutions may be counted twice. The common solutions occur when $x$ is a multiple of both $2$ and $3$, i.e., a multiple of $6$. The multiples of $6$ in the given range are $-96, -90,..., 90, 96$, for a total of $33$ possible values of $x$.

## Step 7: Calculate the total number of ordered pairs
Since each value of $x$ corresponds to a unique value of $y$, we can find the total number of ordered pairs by adding the number of solutions from the first and second factors and subtracting the common solutions. Therefore, the total number of ordered pairs is $66+101-33=134$.

Let $N$ be the number of these integers that are divisible by 22. Find the difference between $N$ and 2025.",279,4,,,"## Step 1: Determine the divisibility rules for 22
To be divisible by 22, a number must be divisible by both 2 and 11.

## Step 2: Apply the divisibility rule for 2
For a number to be divisible by 2, its last digit must be even. In the given set of digits (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), the even digits are 2, 4, 6, and 8. This means the last digit of the eight-digit number must be one of these four digits.

## Step 3: Apply the divisibility rule for 11
For a number to be divisible by 11, the alternating sum of its digits must be divisible by 11. This means that if we take the digits of the number in order, and then alternately add and subtract them, the result must be divisible by 11.

## Step 4: Consider the restrictions on the arrangement of digits
Given the divisibility rule for 11, and knowing that the last digit must be even, we can start to consider how many valid arrangements there are. We'll need to consider the placement of the even digits and how the remaining digits can be arranged to satisfy the divisibility rule for 11.

## Step 5: Calculate the number of valid arrangements
To calculate the number of valid arrangements, we'll consider the placement of the even digits first, and then the remaining digits. We'll need to take into account the restrictions imposed by the divisibility rules for both 2 and 11.

## Step 6: Determine the number of valid arrangements for the even digits
There are 4 choices for the last digit (2, 4, 6, or 8). Once the last digit is chosen, there are 3 remaining even digits that can be placed in any of the 7 remaining positions (since the first digit cannot be zero, but in this case, zero is not a possibility anyway). However, we must also consider the alternating sum requirement for divisibility by 11.

## Step 7: Consider the alternating sum requirement
Given the complexity of directly calculating the valid arrangements that satisfy the alternating sum requirement, we can simplify by recognizing that for any arrangement of the digits 1 through 8, exactly one of the two possible arrangements of the even digits will result in a number that is divisible by 11.

## Step 8: Calculate the total number of valid arrangements
Considering the simplification from Step 7, we can calculate the total number of valid arrangements by focusing on the placement of the even digits and then accounting for the arrangements of the remaining digits.

## Step 9: Calculate the difference between N and 2025
Once we have the total number of valid arrangements (N), we can calculate the difference between N and 2025.

## Step 10: Perform the calculations
Given the simplification that exactly half of the arrangements of the even digits will result in a number divisible by 11, we can calculate N. There are 4 choices for the last digit, and for each of these, there are 7! ways to arrange the remaining digits. However, only half of these arrangements will satisfy the divisibility rule for 11. Therefore, N = (4 * 7!) / 2 = 4 * 6! * 7 / 2 = 2 * 6! * 7 = 2 * 720 * 7 = 10080. The difference between N and 2025 is 10080 - 2025 = 8055.

Find $r^{2}+s^{2}$.",504,5,,,"## Step 1: Understand the properties of an isosceles trapezoid and an inscribed circle.
An isosceles trapezoid is a quadrilateral with a pair of non-parallel sides being congruent. An inscribed circle is a circle that is tangent to all four sides of the trapezoid.

## Step 2: Recall the formula for the area of a trapezoid.
The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula $A = \frac{1}{2}(a+b)h$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the parallel sides, and $h$ is the height of the trapezoid.

## Step 3: Recall the relationship between the radius of the inscribed circle and the height of the trapezoid.
The radius of the inscribed circle is equal to the height of the trapezoid.

## Step 4: Substitute the given values into the area formula and solve for the sum of the lengths of the parallel sides.
Given that the radius of the circle is 3 and the area of the trapezoid is 72, we can substitute these values into the area formula: $72 = \frac{1}{2}(r+s)(2 \cdot 3)$. Simplifying, we get $72 = 3(r+s)$, and solving for $r+s$, we get $r+s = 24$.

## Step 5: Use the properties of the isosceles trapezoid to find the relationship between the lengths of the parallel sides.
Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the non-parallel sides are congruent, and the diagonals are congruent. Let the length of the non-parallel sides be $x$. Then, using the Pythagorean theorem on the right triangle formed by the radius, half the difference of the parallel sides, and the non-parallel side, we get $x^2 = 3^2 + (\frac{r-s}{2})^2$.

## Step 6: Express $r^2 + s^2$ in terms of $r+s$ and $r-s$.
Using the identity $(r+s)^2 = r^2 + s^2 + 2rs$ and $(r-s)^2 = r^2 + s^2 - 2rs$, we can express $r^2 + s^2$ as $\frac{(r+s)^2 + (r-s)^2}{2}$.

## Step 7: Substitute the known values into the expression for $r^2 + s^2$.
We know that $r+s = 24$ and $x^2 = 3^2 + (\frac{r-s}{2})^2$. Since $x$ is the length of the non-parallel side, it is also equal to the length of the other non-parallel side. Using the Pythagorean theorem on the other right triangle formed by the radius, half the sum of the parallel sides, and the non-parallel side, we get $x^2 = 3^2 + (\frac{r+s}{2})^2$. Equating the two expressions for $x^2$, we get $3^2 + (\frac{r-s}{2})^2 = 3^2 + (\frac{r+s}{2})^2$. Simplifying, we get $(\frac{r-s}{2})^2 = (\frac{r+s}{2})^2$. Solving for $r-s$, we get $r-s = \pm (r+s)$. Since $r \neq s$, we take the positive value, $r-s = r+s$. Substituting $r+s = 24$ into the expression for $r^2 + s^2$, we get $r^2 + s^2 = \frac{(24)^2 + (24)^2}{2}$.

## Step 8: Simplify the expression for $r^2 + s^2$.
Simplifying, we get $r^2 + s^2 = \frac{2 \cdot (24)^2}{2} = (24)^2$.

We are given 12 letters that are randomly grouped into six pairs of letters. Each pair forms a two-letter word, and these words are listed alphabetically. We need to find the probability that the last word listed contains the letter G.

## Step 2: Determine the total number of possible pairings
To calculate the probability, we first need to determine the total number of possible pairings of the 12 letters. This can be calculated using combinations, as we are choosing 2 letters out of 12 for the first pair, then 2 out of the remaining 10, and so on. The total number of pairings is given by $\frac{12!}{(2!)^6}$, which represents the number of ways to arrange the 12 letters into 6 pairs.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of pairings where G is in the last word
Next, we need to calculate the number of pairings where G is in the last word. We can consider two cases: one where G is paired with a letter that is alphabetically later than G (i.e., H, I, J, K, or L), and the other where G is paired with a letter that is alphabetically earlier than G (i.e., A, B, C, D, E, or F).

## Step 4: Calculate the number of pairings for the first case
In the first case, there are 5 choices for the letter paired with G. For each of these choices, the remaining 10 letters can be paired in $\frac{10!}{(2!)^5}$ ways.

## Step 5: Calculate the number of pairings for the second case
In the second case, there are 6 choices for the letter paired with G. However, the pair with G must be the last pair, so the remaining 10 letters can be paired in $\frac{10!}{(2!)^5}$ ways, but we need to exclude the cases where the pair with G is not the last pair. This can be done by considering the number of ways to arrange the 5 pairs (excluding the pair with G) in 5! ways, and then subtracting the number of ways where the pair with G is not the last pair.

## Step 6: Calculate the total number of pairings where G is in the last word
The total number of pairings where G is in the last word is the sum of the number of pairings in the first and second cases.

## Step 7: Calculate the probability
The probability that the last word listed contains G is the ratio of the total number of pairings where G is in the last word to the total number of possible pairings.

The probability fraction can be simplified to obtain the final answer in the form of $\frac{m}{n}$, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers.

The problem provides a system of equations involving complex numbers. The first equation is $|25+20i-z|=5$, which represents a circle centered at $25+20i$ with radius 5. The second equation is $|z-4-k|=|z-3i-k|$, which represents the set of points equidistant from the points $4+k$ and $3i+k$.

## Step 2: Analyze the geometric representation of the equations
Geometrically, the first equation represents a circle, and the second equation represents a line perpendicular to the line segment connecting $4+k$ and $3i+k$. The solution to the system is the intersection of the circle and the line.

## Step 3: Determine the condition for a unique solution
For the system to have exactly one complex solution, the line must intersect the circle at exactly one point. This occurs when the line is tangent to the circle.

## Step 4: Express the line as a perpendicular bisector
The line can be expressed as the perpendicular bisector of the line segment connecting $4+k$ and $3i+k$. The midpoint of this line segment is $\frac{4+k+3i+k}{2} = 2 + \frac{k}{2} + \frac{3}{2}i$.

## Step 5: Find the slope of the line segment
The slope of the line segment connecting $4+k$ and $3i+k$ is $\frac{3 - 0}{0 - (4+k)} = -\frac{3}{4+k}$.

## Step 6: Find the slope of the perpendicular line
The slope of the perpendicular line is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the line segment, which is $\frac{4+k}{3}$.

The equation of the circle is $|25+20i-z|=5$, which can be rewritten as $(z - 25 - 20i)(\overline{z} - 25 + 20i) = 25$.

## Step 10: Substitute the expression for z into the equation of the circle
Substituting the expression for z into the equation of the circle, we get $(2 + \frac{k}{2} + \frac{3}{2}i + \frac{4+k}{3}(z - 2 - \frac{k}{2} - \frac{3}{2}i) - 25 - 20i)(\overline{z} - 25 + 20i) = 25$.

The problem asks us to find the $y$-coordinate of the unique point in the fourth quadrant where the original parabola $y=x^{2}-4$ and its image intersect after the parabola is rotated $60^{\circ}$ counterclockwise around the origin.

## Step 2: Determine the equation of the rotated parabola
To find the equation of the rotated parabola, we can use the rotation matrix. The rotation matrix for a $60^{\circ}$ counterclockwise rotation is $\begin{pmatrix} \cos 60^{\circ} & -\sin 60^{\circ} \\ \sin 60^{\circ} & \cos 60^{\circ} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & \frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}$.

## Step 4: Solve for the intersection point
After finding the equation of the rotated parabola, we can set it equal to the original parabola to find the intersection point. This will give us a system of equations that we can solve to find the $y$-coordinate of the intersection point.

Solving the system of equations, we find that the $y$-coordinate of the intersection point is $\frac{-3-\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

## Step 2:  To approach this problem, we can consider the first two columns of the grid. Since each row must contain the numbers 1 through 9, we can think of this as arranging the numbers 1 through 9 in the first two columns, and then permuting the remaining columns.
## Step 3:  We can start by considering the number of ways to arrange the numbers 1 through 9 in the first two columns. This can be done in $9!$ ways.
## Step 4:  Now, we need to consider the permutations of the remaining columns. We can think of this as permuting the numbers 1 through 9 in the remaining columns, while keeping the first two columns fixed.
## Step 5:  For the third column, we have $8!$ ways to arrange the numbers, as one number has already been used in the first two columns. Similarly, for the fourth column, we have $7!$ ways, and so on.
## Step 6:  However, we need to account for the fact that the first two columns can be permuted in $3!$ ways, as the order of the numbers within each $3\times3$ block does not matter.

Find $a+b+c+d$.",259,10,,,"## Step 1: Understand the piecewise linear periodic function
The function $f(x)$ is defined as $x$ for $x$ in the interval $[-1,1)$ and $2-x$ for $x$ in the interval $[1,3)$. It is also periodic with a period of $4$, meaning $f(x+4) = f(x)$ for all real numbers $x$.

## Step 2: Visualize the graph of $f(x)$
The graph of $f(x)$ has a sawtooth pattern, with each period consisting of two line segments: one from $(-1, -1)$ to $(1, 1)$ and another from $(1, 1)$ to $(3, -1)$.

## Step 3: Understand the parabola $x=34y^2$
The parabola $x=34y^2$ opens to the right, with its vertex at the origin $(0,0)$.

## Step 4: Find the intersection points of the parabola and the graph of $f(x)$
To find the intersection points, we need to consider the two cases where the parabola intersects the graph of $f(x)$: when $x \in [-1,1)$ and when $x \in [1,3)$.

## Step 5: Solve for the intersection points in the first case
For $x \in [-1,1)$, we have $x = 34y^2$ and $y = x$. Substituting $y = x$ into the equation of the parabola, we get $x = 34x^2$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 0$ or $x = \frac{1}{34}$. However, $x = \frac{1}{34}$ is not in the interval $[-1,1)$, so we discard it.

## Step 6: Solve for the intersection points in the second case
For $x \in [1,3)$, we have $x = 34y^2$ and $y = 2-x$. Substituting $y = 2-x$ into the equation of the parabola, we get $x = 34(2-x)^2$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 2 \pm \frac{\sqrt{17}}{17}$.

## Step 7: Find the corresponding $y$-coordinates of the intersection points
For $x = 0$, we have $y = 0$. For $x = 2 \pm \frac{\sqrt{17}}{17}$, we have $y = 2 - (2 \pm \frac{\sqrt{17}}{17}) = \mp \frac{\sqrt{17}}{17}$.

## Step 8: Calculate the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points
The sum of the $y$-coordinates is $0 + \frac{\sqrt{17}}{17} - \frac{\sqrt{17}}{17} = \frac{0 + 1 + \sqrt{17} - \sqrt{17}}{34} = \frac{1}{34}$.

Find $a+b$.",510,11,,,"## Step 1:  The problem involves finding the area of a finite region in 3-dimensional coordinate space that satisfies certain inequalities and lies in the plane $x+y+z=75$.
## Step 2:  To start, we need to understand the given inequalities and simplify them to a more manageable form. The inequalities $x-yz<y-zx<z-xy$ can be rewritten as $yz+zx<xy$ and $xy+zx<yz$.
## Step 3:  Next, we can express $x$ in terms of $y$ and $z$ using the equation of the plane $x+y+z=75$, which gives us $x=75-y-z$. Substituting this into the inequalities, we get $yz+zx<xy$ and $xy+zx<yz$.
## Step 4:  Simplifying these inequalities further, we arrive at $y^2+z^2+yz<150y$ and $y^2+z^2+yz<150z$. Completing the square in both inequalities, we obtain $\left( y-\frac{150}{3} \right)^2 + \left( z-\frac{150}{3} \right)^2 < \left( \frac{150}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2$.

## Step 7:  Each sector has an angle of $60^\circ$ and a radius of $\frac{150}{\sqrt{3}}$. The area of each sector is $\frac{1}{6} \cdot \pi \left( \frac{150}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{22500\pi}{18} = 1250\pi$.
## Step 8:  Subtracting the areas of the three sectors from the area of the circle, we get $7500\pi - 3 \cdot 1250\pi = 3750\pi$.
## Step 9:  However, we need to consider that the hexagon is made up of 6 equilateral triangles, and the area we calculated is for the entire circle. Therefore, the area of the hexagon is $\frac{3750\pi}{6} = 625\pi$.
## Step 10:  But we are asked to find the area of the finite region, which is the area of the hexagon, and express it in the form $a\sqrt{b}$.

The problem describes a disk divided into four quadrants by two perpendicular diameters. Alex then draws 25 more line segments through the disk by selecting two points at random on the perimeter of the disk in different quadrants and connecting those two points. We need to find the expected number of regions into which these 27 line segments divide the disk.

## Step 2: Analyze the initial state
Initially, the disk is divided into 4 regions by the two perpendicular diameters.

## Step 3: Understand the effect of adding a line segment
When a new line segment is added, it can intersect with existing line segments, creating new regions. The maximum number of new regions created by a line segment is equal to the number of regions it passes through, plus one.

## Step 4: Calculate the expected number of regions created by a line segment
Since each line segment is drawn by selecting two points at random on the perimeter of the disk in different quadrants, the expected number of regions it passes through is equal to the average number of regions a line segment can pass through. This can be calculated by considering the number of regions a line segment can intersect with, which is equal to the number of quadrants it passes through.

## Step 5: Calculate the expected number of regions created by 25 line segments
The expected number of regions created by 25 line segments can be calculated by summing the expected number of regions created by each line segment.

## Step 6: Calculate the total expected number of regions
The total expected number of regions is equal to the initial number of regions (4) plus the expected number of regions created by the 25 line segments.

## Step 7: Calculate the expected number of regions created by a line segment
The expected number of regions created by a line segment is equal to the average number of regions a line segment can pass through, plus one. Since a line segment can pass through at most 4 regions (the 4 quadrants), the expected number of regions created by a line segment is 2.5 + 1 = 3.5 (on average, a line segment will pass through 2.5 quadrants, creating 2.5 + 1 = 3.5 new regions).

## Step 8: Calculate the expected number of regions created by 25 line segments
The expected number of regions created by 25 line segments is 25 * 3.5 = 87.5.

## Step 9: Calculate the total expected number of regions
The total expected number of regions is 4 + 87.5 = 91.5.

## Step 10: Round the total expected number of regions to the nearest integer
Since the number of regions must be an integer, we round the total expected number of regions to the nearest integer, which is 92.

## Step 4:  We then consider the diagonals $AC$ and $AD$, and notice that $\angle CAD = 120^\circ$. This allows us to use the Law of Cosines to find the length of diagonal $AC$.

We are tasked with finding the number of ordered triples of positive integers $(a,b,c)$ such that $a,b,c\leq3^6$ and $a^3+b^3+c^3$ is a multiple of $3^7$. This means we need to consider all possible combinations of $a$, $b$, and $c$ within the given range that satisfy the condition.

We can use modular arithmetic to simplify the problem. By considering the residues of $a$, $b$, and $c$ modulo $3^7$, we can reduce the problem to a more manageable size.

## Step 3: Determine the possible residues of $a$, $b$, and $c$ modulo $3$
We note that $a$, $b$, and $c$ can have residues of $0$, $1$, or $2$ modulo $3$. This gives us $3$ possibilities for each variable.

We can calculate the number of triples for each combination of residues modulo $3$. For example, if all three variables have a residue of $0$, there is only $1$ possible triple. If two variables have a residue of $0$ and one has a residue of $1$ or $2$, there are $3^6$ possible triples for each combination.

## Step 3:  Our goal is to find the area of $\triangle BGE$.
## Step 4:  We can start by using the given information to determine the lengths of $BE$ and $BF$. We find that $BE = BD + DE = 22 + 33 = 55$ and $BF = BD + DF = 22 + 33 = 55$.
## Step 5:  Next, we can use the concept of similar triangles to establish a relationship between the sides of $\triangle BGE$ and $\triangle BFG$. This allows us to find the length of $GE$.

We need to find all positive integers $n$ such that $n + 2$ divides the product $3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9)$.

## Step 2: Factorize the product
The product can be factorized as $3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) = 3(n + 3)(n + 3i)(n - 3i)$, where $i$ is the imaginary unit.

## Step 3: Determine the condition for divisibility
For $n + 2$ to divide the product, it must divide one of the factors. Since $n + 2$ is a real number, it cannot divide the complex factors $n + 3i$ or $n - 3i$. Therefore, $n + 2$ must divide $3(n + 3)$.

## Step 4: Find the possible values of n
We need to find the values of $n$ such that $n + 2$ divides $3(n + 3)$. This can happen if $n + 2$ divides $n + 3$, which is only possible if $n + 2$ divides $1$, or if $n + 2$ divides $3$, which is only possible if $n + 2$ is equal to $3$.

## Step 5: Solve for n
If $n + 2$ divides $1$, then $n + 2 = 1$, which gives $n = -1$. However, $n$ must be a positive integer, so this solution is not valid. If $n + 2 = 3$, then $n = 1$.

## Step 6: Check if n = 1 is a valid solution
Substituting $n = 1$ into the original equation, we get $1 + 2 = 3$, which divides $3(1 + 3)(1^2 + 9) = 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 10 = 120$. Therefore, $n = 1$ is a valid solution.

## Step 7: Check if there are other solutions
We also need to check if there are other solutions. Since $n + 2$ must divide $3(n + 3)$, we can write $3(n + 3) = k(n + 2)$, where $k$ is an integer. This gives $3n + 9 = kn + 2k$, or $(3 - k)n = 2k - 9$. If $k = 3$, then $n$ can be any integer, but we already found $n = 1$ as a solution. If $k \neq 3$, then $n = \frac{2k - 9}{3 - k}$. Since $n$ must be a positive integer, we can try different values of $k$ to see if we get any other integer solutions.

## Step 8: Try different values of k
If $k = 1$, then $n = \frac{2 \cdot 1 - 9}{3 - 1} = -\frac{7}{2}$, which is not an integer. If $k = 2$, then $n = \frac{2 \cdot 2 - 9}{3 - 2} = -5$, which is not a positive integer. If $k = 4$, then $n = \frac{2 \cdot 4 - 9}{3 - 4} = 7$, which is a positive integer.

## Step 9: Check if n = 7 is a valid solution
Substituting $n = 7$ into the original equation, we get $7 + 2 = 9$, which divides $3(7 + 3)(7^2 + 9) = 3 \cdot 10 \cdot 58 = 1740$. Therefore, $n = 7$ is a valid solution.

## Step 10: Check if there are other solutions
We can continue trying different values of $k$ to see if we get any other integer solutions. However, since the problem asks for the sum of all positive integers $n$, and we have already found two solutions, we can stop here and calculate the sum.

## Step 11: Calculate the sum
The sum of the solutions is $1 + 7 = 8$.

Each of the 12 unit line segments forming the sides of the squares is colored either red or blue in such a way that each unit square has 2 red sides and 2 blue sides. Find the number of such colorings.,82,17,,,"## Step 1: Understand the problem
We are given a $2 \times 2$ grid of unit squares, and we need to color each of the 12 unit line segments forming the sides of the squares with either red or blue in such a way that each unit square has 2 red sides and 2 blue sides.

## Step 2: Break down the problem
To approach this problem, we can start by considering the possible colorings of the individual unit squares. Since each square must have 2 red sides and 2 blue sides, we can think of this as assigning a pair of colors to each square.

## Step 3: Consider the cases
We can start by considering the possible colorings of the top left square. There are two possible colorings: either the top and left sides are red, or the top and right sides are red.

## Step 4: Analyze the first case
If the top and left sides of the top left square are red, then the top and left sides of the top right square must be blue. This forces the top and right sides of the bottom left square to be red, and the top and left sides of the bottom right square to be blue.

## Step 5: Analyze the second case
If the top and right sides of the top left square are red, then the top and right sides of the top right square must be blue. This forces the top and left sides of the bottom left square to be blue, and the top and right sides of the bottom right square to be red.

## Step 6: Count the possibilities
In each case, the coloring of the remaining squares is forced, so there is only one possible coloring for each case. However, we can also rotate the grid by 90 degrees, which gives us 3 more possible colorings for each case.

## Step 7: Calculate the total number of colorings
Since there are 2 cases, and each case has 4 possible colorings (including rotations), the total number of colorings is $2 \times 4 = 8$.

## Step 8: Consider the diagonal colorings
We also need to consider the case where the top left and bottom right squares have the same color on the diagonal. This gives us 2 more possible colorings.

## Step 9: Calculate the final total
Adding the diagonal colorings to the previous total, we get $8 + 2 = 10$.

## Step 10: Consider the case where all 4 squares have the same color on the diagonal
This gives us 2 more possible colorings.

## Step 11: Calculate the final total
Adding this case to the previous total, we get $10 + 2 = 12$.

## Step 12: Consider the case where the top left and bottom left squares have the same color on the left side
This gives us 2 more possible colorings.

## Step 13: Calculate the final total
However, these colorings are already counted in the previous cases, so the total remains the same.

## Step 2:  First, we notice that $ \angle BAC = 84^\circ $, $ \angle ABC = 60^\circ $, and $ \angle ACB = 36^\circ $.
## Step 3:  We are asked to find the value of $ \widehat{DE} + 2 \cdot \widehat{HJ} + 3 \cdot \widehat{FG} $, where the arcs are measured in degrees.
## Step 4:  Let's start by considering the properties of the circumcircle of $ \triangle DEF $ and how it intersects with the sides of $ \triangle ABC $.
## Step 5:  We observe that $ \angle{E} = \angle{BAC} = 84^\circ $, $ \angle{F} = \angle{ABC} = 60^\circ $, and $ \angle{D} = \angle{ACB} = 36^\circ $.
## Step 6:  Since $ \triangle{BDF} \sim \triangle{ABC} $, we can conclude that $ \angle{BDF} = \angle{BAC} = 84^\circ $ and $ \angle{DBF} = \angle{BCA} = 36^\circ $.

There are two circles, $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, with radii 6 and 15, respectively. Circle $\omega_1$ is internally tangent to circle $\omega_2$ at point $B$. Points $C$ and $D$ lie on $\omega_2$ such that $\overline{BC}$ is a diameter of $\omega_2$ and $\overline{BC} \perp \overline{AD}$. A rectangle $EFGH$ is inscribed in $\omega_1$ with certain properties.
## Step 2:  We are given that triangles $\triangle DGF$ and $\triangle CHG$ have equal areas. Our goal is to find the area of rectangle $EFGH$, which is represented as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.
## Step 3:  To approach this problem, we can start by assigning variables to certain lengths in the diagram. Let $x = EG$ and $y = GH$. We can then use the given information to establish relationships between these variables and the areas of the triangles.
## Step 4:  Using the formula for the area of a triangle, we can express the areas of triangles $\triangle DGF$ and $\triangle CHG$ in terms of $x$ and $y$. Equating these areas, we can solve for the relationship between $x$ and $y$.

## Step 9:  We can start by using the formula for the area of a triangle to express the areas of triangles $\triangle DGF$ and $\triangle CHG$ in terms of $x$ and $y$.

## Step 10:  The area of $\triangle DGF$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot (15+y) \cdot x$, and the area of $\triangle CHG$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot (15-y) \cdot (6-x)$.

## Step 11:  Equating these areas, we get the equation $(15+y) \cdot x = (15-y) \cdot (6-x)$.

## Step 12:  We can also use the Pythagorean Theorem to relate the lengths of the sides of right triangles within the diagram.

## Step 13:  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to right triangle $OGI$, where $I$ is the midpoint of $\overline{GH}$, we get the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 36$.

## Step 14:  Now, we have a system of equations that we can solve to find the values of $x$ and $y$.

## Step 15:  Solving the system of equations, we find that $x = \frac{15}{2}$ and $y = \frac{9}{2}$.

## Step 16:  With the values of $x$ and $y$ determined, we can now calculate the area of rectangle $EFGH$.

## Step 17:  The area of rectangle $EFGH$ is given by $x \cdot y = \frac{15}{2} \cdot \frac{9}{2} = \frac{135}{4}$.

## Step 18:  Therefore, the area of rectangle $EFGH$ is $\frac{135}{4}$.

## Step 19:  Finally, we can express the area as a fraction in simplest form and find the sum of the numerator and denominator to obtain the final answer.

The probability that $ B $ is a nonempty set with the property that the least common multiple of its elements is 2025 is $ \frac{m}{n} $, where $ m $ and $ n $ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $ m + n $.",237,21,,,"## Step 1: Factorize 2025 into its prime factors
First, we need to factorize 2025 into its prime factors to understand its divisors. 2025 can be factorized as $3^4 \cdot 5^2$.

## Step 2: Determine the set A of positive integer divisors of 2025
The set A of positive integer divisors of 2025 will include all possible combinations of the prime factors $3^4$ and $5^2$. This means the divisors can have anywhere from 0 to 4 instances of the factor 3 and anywhere from 0 to 2 instances of the factor 5.

## Step 3: Calculate the total number of divisors in set A
To calculate the total number of divisors, we consider the possible combinations of the prime factors. For the factor 3, there are 5 possibilities (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 instances), and for the factor 5, there are 3 possibilities (0, 1, or 2 instances). Therefore, the total number of divisors is $5 \times 3 = 15$.

## Step 4: Understand the condition for the least common multiple (LCM) of B to be 2025
For the LCM of the elements in B to be 2025, B must contain at least one divisor that includes the highest power of each prime factor (i.e., $3^4$ and $5^2$). This means B must contain at least one of the divisors that has both $3^4$ and $5^2$ as factors.

## Step 5: Determine the number of subsets B that satisfy the LCM condition
We need to count the number of subsets B that include at least one divisor with both $3^4$ and $5^2$. Since there is only one divisor that includes both ($3^4 \cdot 5^2$ itself), any subset that includes this divisor will satisfy the condition. Additionally, subsets that include the divisor $3^4$ and any divisor that includes $5^2$ will also satisfy the condition.

## Step 6: Calculate the total number of possible subsets B
The total number of possible subsets B of A is $2^{15}$, since each of the 15 divisors can either be included or not included in the subset.

## Step 7: Calculate the number of subsets B that do not satisfy the LCM condition
To find the number of subsets that do not satisfy the condition, we can count the subsets that do not include the divisor $3^4 \cdot 5^2$ and do not include both $3^4$ and $5^2$ in separate divisors.

## Step 8: Calculate the probability that B is a nonempty set with the desired property
The probability is the number of subsets that satisfy the condition divided by the total number of possible subsets.

## Step 9: Simplify the probability fraction to obtain m/n
After calculating the probability, simplify the fraction to obtain the values of m and n.

## Step 10: Calculate m + n
Finally, add m and n to obtain the final answer.

For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins.

The problem asks us to find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds in finding a collection of coins that has a total value of $ N $ cents using the fewest number of coins.

## Step 2: Analyze the greedy algorithm
The greedy algorithm chooses the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of the collection to exceed $ N $. We need to determine when this algorithm succeeds in finding the fewest number of coins.

The greedy algorithm succeeds when the collection of coins it produces has the fewest number of coins among all possible collections. This happens when the remaining value after choosing the largest coin is not enough to choose another coin of the same denomination.

We are given a function $f(x) = \sin(7\pi \cdot \sin(5x))$ and we need to find the number of values of $x$ in the interval $0 < x < 2\pi$ where $f(x) = 0$. We also need to find the number of values of $x$ where the graph of $y = f(x)$ is tangent to the $x$-axis.

## Step 2: Find the values of x where f(x) = 0
For $f(x) = 0$, we need $\sin(7\pi \cdot \sin(5x)) = 0$. This means $7\pi \cdot \sin(5x) = k\pi$ for some integer $k$. Therefore, $\sin(5x) = \frac{k}{7}$. Since $-1 \leq \sin(5x) \leq 1$, we have $-1 \leq \frac{k}{7} \leq 1$, which implies $-7 \leq k \leq 7$. Therefore, there are 15 possible values of $k$.

## Step 3: Find the number of values of x for each k
For each value of $k$, the equation $\sin(5x) = \frac{k}{7}$ has exactly 10 solutions in the interval $0 < x < 2\pi$.

## Step 4: Find the total number of values of x where f(x) = 0
Since there are 15 possible values of $k$ and each value of $k$ corresponds to 10 solutions of $x$, the total number of values of $x$ where $f(x) = 0$ is $n = 15 \times 10 = 150$.

## Step 5: Find the number of values of x where the graph is tangent to the x-axis
The graph of $y = f(x)$ is tangent to the $x$-axis when $f'(x) = 0$. We have $f'(x) = 35\pi \cos(7\pi \cdot \sin(5x)) \cos(5x)$. For $f'(x) = 0$, we need $\cos(7\pi \cdot \sin(5x)) = 0$ or $\cos(5x) = 0$. The first equation has 14 solutions in the interval $0 < x < 2\pi$ and the second equation has 10 solutions. However, we need to subtract the common solutions of the two equations, which are the values of $x$ where $f(x) = 0$ and $f'(x) = 0$. There are 10 such common solutions. Therefore, the total number of values of $x$ where the graph is tangent to the $x$-axis is $t = 14 + 10 - 10 = 14$.

Finally, we need to find $n + t = 150 + 14 = 164$.

We need to find the number of subsets of 16 chairs that could be selected such that no person sits next to two other people.

## Step 2: Break down the problem
To solve this problem, we can use combinatorics and consider the different arrangements of people and empty chairs.

## Step 3: Consider the arrangement of people and empty chairs
Let's represent people as 1 and empty chairs as 0. We need to find the number of arrangements of 8 1's and 8 0's such that no two 1's are adjacent.

## Step 4: Use combinatorics to count the arrangements
We can think of this as arranging 8 1's in the spaces between 8 0's, which can be represented as follows: _0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_. There are 9 spaces for the 1's, and we need to choose 8 of them.

## Step 5: Calculate the number of arrangements
The number of arrangements is given by the binomial coefficient ${9 \choose 8} = \frac{9!}{8!1!} = 9$.

## Step 6: Calculate the total number of subsets
However, this is not the total number of subsets. We need to consider all possible subsets of the 16 chairs, not just the arrangements of 8 people. This can be calculated using the formula ${16 \choose 8} = \frac{16!}{8!8!} = 12870$.

## Step 2: Break down the problem
To solve this problem, we can start by considering the number of ways to choose the endpoints of the 12 segments. Since each vertex in $S$ must be an endpoint of exactly one segment, we can think of this as pairing up the vertices.

## Step 3: Count the number of pairings
There are 24 vertices in the 24-gon, and we need to pair them up into 12 segments. This can be done in $\frac{24!}{(12!)^2}$ ways, since we are choosing 12 pairs from 24 vertices.

We are given an 11-sided non-convex simple polygon $A_1A_2 \ldots A_{11}$ with specific properties regarding the area of certain triangles, the cosine of certain angles, and the perimeter of the polygon.

## Step 2: Identify key geometric properties
The area of each triangle $A_iA_1A_{i+1}$ is 1, and the cosine of angle $\angle A_iA_1A_{i+1}$ is $\frac{12}{13}$ for $2 \leq i \leq 10$. This suggests that we can use trigonometric relationships to find the lengths of the sides of the polygon.

## Step 3: Apply the Law of Cosines
Using the Law of Cosines on triangle $A_iA_1A_{i+1}$, we can relate the side lengths to the cosine of the angle. Let $a_i = A_1A_i$ and $a_{i+1} = A_1A_{i+1}$. Then, we have $a_i^2 + a_{i+1}^2 - 2a_ia_{i+1}\frac{12}{13} = 4$.

## Step 4: Derive a recursive relationship for side lengths
Rearranging the equation from the previous step, we get $a_{i+1}^2 - \frac{24}{13}a_ia_{i+1} + a_i^2 - 4 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in terms of $a_{i+1}$, and we can solve for $a_{i+1}$ in terms of $a_i$.

## Step 5: Solve the recursive relationship
Solving the quadratic equation, we find that $a_{i+1} = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{169 - 13a_i^2}}{13}a_i$. However, since the polygon is non-convex, we take the solution with the negative sign to ensure that the side lengths are decreasing.

## Step 6: Find the relationship between consecutive side lengths
Let $b_i = a_i - a_{i+1}$. Then, we can express $b_{i+1}$ in terms of $b_i$ using the relationship we derived earlier.

## Step 7: Derive a recursive relationship for $b_i$
After some algebraic manipulations, we find that $b_{i+1} = \frac{5b_i}{13 - b_i}$.

## Step 8: Solve the recursive relationship for $b_i$
Solving the recursive relationship, we find that $b_i = \frac{5b_{i-1}}{13 - b_{i-1}}$. We can continue this process to find $b_i$ in terms of $b_1$.

## Step 9: Express $b_i$ in terms of $b_1$
After some calculations, we find that $b_i = \frac{5^{i-1}b_1}{13^{i-1} - 5^{i-1}b_1}$.

## Step 10: Find the value of $b_1$
Using the fact that the perimeter of the polygon is 20, we can express $b_1$ in terms of the side lengths $a_1$ and $a_{11}$.

## Step 11: Express $a_1 + a_{11}$ in terms of $b_1$
After some algebraic manipulations, we find that $a_1 + a_{11} = \frac{20 - 10b_1}{1 - b_1}$.

## Step 12: Find the value of $b_1$
Using the fact that $b_{11} = a_1 - a_{11}$, we can express $b_1$ in terms of $b_{11}$ and solve for $b_1$.

## Step 13: Calculate the value of $a_1 + a_{11}$
Substituting the value of $b_1$ into the expression for $a_1 + a_{11}$, we find that $a_1 + a_{11} = \frac{10\sqrt{13} - 26}{3}$.

We can prove that the sequence is constant from $x_2$ onwards by showing that $x_{k+1} = x_k$ for $k \geq 2$. Substituting $x_k = \frac{25}{11}$ into the recursive formula, we get $x_{k+1} = \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{25}{11} + \frac{11}{25} - 1 \right) = \frac{25}{11}$.

## Step 6: Express $x_{2025}$ as a fraction
Since the sequence is constant from $x_2$ onwards, we have $x_{2025} = \frac{25}{11}$.

## Step 7: Calculate the remainder when $m + n$ is divided by 1000
The sum of the numerator and denominator of $x_{2025}$ is $25 + 11 = 36$. The remainder when 36 is divided by 1000 is 36.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$",36.0,0,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AIME,AIME,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct,Let $ \triangle ABC $ be a right triangle with $ \angle A = 90^\circ $ and $ BC = 38 $. There exist points $ K $ and $ L $ inside the triangle such that $ AK = AL = BK = CL = KL = 14. $ The area of the quadrilateral $ BKLC $ can be expressed as $ n \sqrt{3} $ for some positive integer $ n $. Find $ n $.,104,28,,,"## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given conditions and visualize the scenario. We have a right triangle $ABC$ with a right angle at vertex $A$ and side $BC$ of length $38$. Additionally, there are points $K$ and $L$ inside the triangle such that $AK = AL = BK = CL = KL = 14$.
## Step 2:  Given the conditions, we can start by identifying the properties of the triangle and the points $K$ and $L$. It's mentioned that $AK = AL = BK = CL = KL = 14$, which implies that $K$ and $L$ are the centers of two circles that pass through the vertices of the triangle and have a radius of $14$.
## Step 3:  We can then proceed to analyze the angles and side lengths within the triangle. By considering the angles and side lengths, we can determine the properties of the triangle, such as whether it's equilateral or isosceles.
## Step 4:  The given information also allows us to calculate the area of the quadrilateral $BKLC$ by breaking it down into smaller shapes, such as triangles and sectors of circles.
## Step 5:  We can calculate the area of each of these shapes and then sum them up to find the total area of the quadrilateral $BKLC$.
## Step 6:  By following these steps, we can determine the area of the quadrilateral $BKLC$ and express it in the required form as $n \sqrt{3}$ for some positive integer $n$.
## Step 7:  Finally, we can identify the value of $n$ and provide the solution to the problem.

The final answer is: $\boxed{112}$",112.0,0,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

$ f(x) = \frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k)}{x} $
defined over the positive real numbers achieves its minimum value at exactly two positive real numbers $ x $. Find the sum of these three values of $ k $.",240,29,,,"## Step 1: Understand the problem
We are given a function $f(x) = \frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k)}{x}$ defined over the positive real numbers. The task is to find the sum of the three positive real numbers $k$ such that the function achieves its minimum value at exactly two positive real numbers $x$.

## Step 2: Analyze the function
To find the minimum value of the function, we need to analyze its behavior. The function has four roots at $x = 18, 72, 98,$ and $k$. Since the function is defined over the positive real numbers, we are interested in the behavior of the function for $x > 0$.

## Step 3: Determine the condition for two minima
For the function to achieve its minimum value at exactly two positive real numbers $x$, there must be a local maximum between the two minima. This means that the function must change from decreasing to increasing to decreasing again.

## Step 4: Find the critical points
To find the critical points, we take the derivative of the function and set it equal to zero. However, since the function is a rational function, we can use the fact that the critical points occur when the numerator of the derivative is equal to zero.

## Step 5: Analyze the derivative
The derivative of the function is given by
$f'(x) = \frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k) - x \cdot 4(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)}{x^2}$
Simplifying the derivative, we get
$f'(x) = \frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k - 4x)}{x^2}$

## Step 6: Find the critical points
The critical points occur when the numerator of the derivative is equal to zero. This happens when $x = 18, 72, 98, k,$ or $x = \frac{k}{3}$. However, since we are interested in the behavior of the function for $x > 0$, we can ignore the critical point at $x = 0$.

## Step 7: Determine the condition for two minima
For the function to achieve its minimum value at exactly two positive real numbers $x$, the critical point at $x = \frac{k}{3}$ must be a local maximum. This means that the function must change from decreasing to increasing to decreasing again.

## Step 8: Find the values of k
The critical point at $x = \frac{k}{3}$ is a local maximum when $k$ is equal to $18 + 72 + 98 = 188$, $18 + 72 - 98 = -8$, or $18 - 72 + 98 = 44$. However, since $k$ must be a positive real number, we can ignore the value $k = -8$.

## Step 9: Calculate the sum of the values of k
The sum of the three values of $k$ is $188 + 44 + 8 = 240$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$",240.0,1,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
