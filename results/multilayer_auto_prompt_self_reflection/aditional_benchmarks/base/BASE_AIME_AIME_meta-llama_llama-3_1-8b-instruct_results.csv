## Step 2:  We are given the numbers $17_b$ and $97_b$, where $b$ is the base of the number system. We want to find the sum of all integer bases $b>9$ for which $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b$.
## Step 3:  To start, we need to convert the numbers $17_b$ and $97_b$ to base 10. The number $17_b$ in base 10 can be represented as $1\cdot b + 7$, and the number $97_b$ in base 10 can be represented as $9\cdot b + 7$.
## Step 4:  Now, we want to find the values of $b$ for which $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b$. This means that $9b + 7$ must be divisible by $b + 7$.
## Step 5:  To simplify this, we can use the property that if $a$ divides $b$, then $a$ divides $b - ka$ for any integer $k$. Applying this property, we get that $b + 7$ divides $2b + 7$.
## Step 6:  This simplifies to $b + 7$ dividing $14$, which gives us the possible values of $b$ as $7$ and $1$. However, we are only interested in bases greater than $9$, so the only valid value of $b$ is $7$.
## Step 7:  Therefore, the sum of all integer bases $b>9$ for which $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b$ is $\boxed{7}$.

Find the area of heptagon $AFNBCEM$.",588,1,,,"## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of reflections and how they relate to the areas of triangles and quadrilaterals.
## Step 2:  First, we are given that quadrilateral $DEGF$ has an area of 288. We know that the area of a quadrilateral can be found by dividing it into two triangles and summing their areas.
## Step 3:  The given area of quadrilateral $DEGF$ is equal to the sum of the areas of triangles $DEG$ and $EFG$. This is a key insight that will help us find the area of the heptagon $AFNBCEM$.
## Step 4:  We are also given that $M$ is the reflection of $D$ through $F$, and $N$ is the reflection of $G$ through $E$. This means that $MF$ is a line of reflection, and $NG$ is also a line of reflection.
## Step 5:  The area of a triangle can be found using the formula $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$. We can use this formula to find the areas of triangles $DEG$ and $EFG$.
## Step 6:  The area of triangle $DEG$ is $\frac{1}{2} \times 20 \times 24 = 240$, and the area of triangle $EFG$ is $\frac{1}{2} \times 20 \times 12 = 120$. Therefore, the area of quadrilateral $DEGF$ is $240 + 120 = 360$.
## Step 7:  However, we are given that the area of quadrilateral $DEGF$ is 288, which is less than the calculated area of 360. This discrepancy arises because the points $M$ and $N$ are reflections of $D$ and $G$ through $F$ and $E$, respectively.
## Step 8:  The area of the heptagon $AFNBCEM$ is equal to the sum of the areas of quadrilateral $DEGF$ and the two triangles $FNM$ and $CEN$.
## Step 9:  Since the area of quadrilateral $DEGF$ is 288, we can find the area of the heptagon by adding the areas of triangles $FNM$ and $CEN$ to 288.
## Step 10:  The area of triangle $FNM$ is equal to the area of triangle $DEF$, which is $\frac{1}{2} \times 20 \times 24 = 240$. Similarly, the area of triangle $CEN$ is equal to the area of triangle $CEG$, which is $\frac{1}{2} \times 20 \times 12 = 120$.

Let $N$ be the number of different assignments of flavors to players that meet these conditions. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by 1000.",16,2,,,"## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the different ways the 9 players can be assigned to the three flavors of ice cream: chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry.
## Step 2:  We are given that at least one player chose each flavor, and the number of players who chose chocolate was greater than the number of players who chose vanilla, which was greater than the number of players who chose strawberry.
## Step 3:  Let's start by considering the possible distributions of players among the three flavors. We can represent the number of players who chose chocolate as $c$, the number who chose vanilla as $v$, and the number who chose strawberry as $s$.
## Step 4:  Given the conditions, we know that $c > v > s$, and $c + v + s = 9$.
## Step 5:  We can use a stars and bars approach to find the number of ways to distribute the players among the flavors. This involves finding the number of ways to arrange 9 players into 3 distinct groups, where the order of the groups matters.
## Step 6:  We can represent this as a string of 9 stars (representing the players) and 2 bars (representing the divisions between the flavors). The number of ways to arrange these stars and bars is given by the binomial coefficient $\binom{9+2}{2} = \binom{11}{2} = 55$.
## Step 7:  However, not all of these arrangements satisfy the given conditions. We need to consider the cases where the number of players who chose chocolate is greater than the number who chose vanilla, which is greater than the number who chose strawberry.
## Step 8:  We can break this down into cases based on the number of players who chose chocolate, and then find the number of valid arrangements for each case.
## Step 9:  For $c = 5$, there are $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ ways to choose the players who chose chocolate, and the remaining 4 players must choose vanilla and strawberry. There are 2 ways to assign the remaining players to vanilla and strawberry, so there are $10 \cdot 2 = 20$ valid arrangements for this case.
## Step 10:  For $c = 6$, there are $\binom{6}{4} = 15$ ways to choose the players who chose chocolate, and the remaining 3 players must choose vanilla and strawberry. There are 2 ways to assign the remaining players to vanilla and strawberry, so there are $15 \cdot 2 = 30$ valid arrangements for this case.
## Step 11:  For $c = 7$, there are $\binom{7}{5} = 21$ ways to choose the players who chose chocolate, and the remaining 2 players must choose vanilla and strawberry. There is only 1 way to assign the remaining players to vanilla and strawberry, so there are $21 \cdot 1 = 21$ valid arrangements for this case.
## Step 12:  For $c = 8$, there are $\binom{8}{6} = 28$ ways to choose the players who chose chocolate, and the remaining 1 player must choose vanilla and strawberry. There is only 1 way to assign the remaining player to vanilla and strawberry, so there are $28 \cdot 1 = 28$ valid arrangements for this case.

This gives us $3(4x^{2}-xy-2y^{2})=0$.
## Step 2:  We can further factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses by finding two numbers that multiply to $-8$ and add to $-1$. These numbers are $-4$ and $2$, so we can factor the expression as $3(4x^{2}-4xy+2xy-2y^{2})$, which simplifies to $3(2x(2x-y)+y(2x-y))$.
## Step 3:  Factoring out the common term $(2x-y)$ from the expression gives us $3(2x-y)(2x-y)$, which simplifies to $3(2x-y)^{2}$.
## Step 4:  Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the equations $3(2x-y)^{2}=0$ and $2x-y=0$.
## Step 5:  Solving the first equation $3(2x-y)^{2}=0$ gives us $2x-y=0$, which simplifies to $y=2x$.
## Step 6:  Substituting $y=2x$ into the original equation $12x^{2}-xy-6y^{2}=0$ gives us $12x^{2}-2x^{2}-12x^{2}=0$, which simplifies to $0=0$. This means that any value of $x$ will satisfy this equation, so we have infinitely many solutions of the form $(x,2x)$.
## Step 7:  However, we are asked to find the number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ where both $x$ and $y$ are integers between $-100$ and $100$, inclusive. So, we need to find the number of integer solutions for $x$ in the range $-100 \leq x \leq 100$.

## Step 3:  The second equation $|z-4-k|=|z-3i-k|$ represents the set of points that are equidistant from the points $(4+k, 0)$ and $0, 3i)$.
## Step 4:  For the second equation to have exactly one solution, the line connecting the two points $(4+k, 0)$ and $(0, 3i)$ must be a diameter of the circle represented by the first equation.

Find $a+b+c$.",62,8,,,"## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the transformation that occurs when the parabola $y=x^{2}-4$ is rotated $60^{\circ}$ counterclockwise around the origin.
## Step 2:  The rotation of the parabola can be represented by the transformation $(x,y) \rightarrow \left(\frac{x-y}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{x+y}{\sqrt{2}}\right)$.
## Step 3:  We are looking for the point of intersection between the original parabola and its image after the rotation. This point will satisfy both the original equation $y=x^{2}-4$ and the equation of the rotated parabola.
## Step 4:  To find the point of intersection, we can substitute the expression for $y$ from the original equation into the equation of the rotated parabola.
## Step 5:  Substituting $y=x^{2}-4$ into the equation of the rotated parabola gives us $\frac{x^{2}-4-y}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{x+y}{\sqrt{2}}$.
## Step 6:  Simplifying this equation, we get $x^{2}-4-y = x+y$, which further simplifies to $x^{2}-x-4-y=0$.

## Step 12:  The $x$-coordinate of the point of intersection in the fourth quadrant is given by $\frac{8-60}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{-52}{\sqrt{2}}$.
## Step 13:  To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{2}$, giving us $\frac{-52\sqrt{2}}{2} = -26\sqrt{2}$.

However, some of these configurations are invalid because they do not contain all 18 different numbers that can be found in the first two rows. Therefore, we must divide the number of valid configurations by 9!. This leaves us with 9^9/9! possible configurations.

Now, we must determine the number of configurations for the first two rows so that they contain the correct values for the top left 2x2 area. We can choose the number in the top middle cell as 9, the second row has the same possibilities for numbers as the first row: 9!, define the number in the second column of the second row to replace the number from the first row, then for the third column the first row has nine possibilities, and again remove one possibility so that there is only one number left (being the one on the first row). After that we can compute the average number of cells the second row can fill, or set the same amount of restrictions by defining 9 more numbers not on the second row to remove for each standard combination. In essence, we then are solving for the original number of possible combinations for a map containing just the top left 2x2.
 Once we define how many combinations are valid left, the last 6 rows are filled in using exactly the same logic. Then we multiply the top left 2x2 by 9! four times to make the combinations not overlap. Finally, we compute p*q*r*s^d, and we get the final number.


Further breaking down the number of combinations in the top left 2x2 area into the results from this last manipulation as an example yields $p^a\cdot q^b$
 = (9^2*7)(8^2*4)

 9 is the result from choosing for the puzzle map 9 numbers which will not appear in the next row we create using a specific technique to divide combinations, essentially breaking them down by the number of numbers you can use for each row we're going to multiply that technique by 3

7 is the result from  not filling entire numbers in the top left 2x2 twice.

8 is the result from picking 8 over only 9 from each row when there still is a teeny tiny bit of randomness left.

4 stems from deciding to just place the elements from the second (or third column) of the row, leaving the bottom cells filled.

Find $a+b+c+d$.",259,10,,,"## Step 1:  To find the intersection points of the parabola $x=34y^2$ and the piecewise linear function $f(x)$, we need to solve the equation $f(x) = 34y^2$ for $x$ in the intervals $[-1,1)$ and $[1,3)$.
## Step 2:  In the interval $[-1,1)$, the function $f(x)$ is defined as $x$, so we have the equation $x = 34y^2$. Solving for $y$, we get $y = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{34}}\sqrt{x}$.

Find $a+b$.",510,11,,,"## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given inequalities and the equation of the plane.
## Step 2:  The equation of the plane is $x+y+z=75$, and the inequalities are $x-yz<y-zx<z-xy$.
## Step 3:  We start by manipulating the given inequalities to simplify them and make them easier to work with.
## Step 4:  We can rewrite the inequalities as $y+z < \frac{x}{1-x}$ and $z+x < \frac{y}{1-y}$.
## Step 5:  Next, we introduce a new variable $t = x+y+z$, which allows us to express $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of $t$ and a new variable $w = xy+yz+zx$.
## Step 6:  We then obtain the inequalities $t-1 < w < \frac{t}{2}$ and $t-1 < w < \frac{t}{2}$, which can be further simplified to $t-1 < w < \frac{t}{2}$.
## Step 7:  We also have the condition $t=75$, which is derived from the equation of the plane.
## Step 8:  By substituting $t=75$ into the inequality $t-1 < w < \frac{t}{2}$, we get $74 < w < 37.5$.
## Step 9:  We then consider the range of $w$ and find that it is bounded by the curves $w = 74 - \sqrt{937.5 - w^2}$ and $w = 74 + \sqrt{937.5 - w^2}$.
## Step 10:  We also need to consider the region bounded by the curves $w = x+y+z$, $x+y+z=75$, and $x=0$.
## Step 11:  By analyzing the intersection points of these curves, we find that the region is bounded by the curves $w = 74 - \sqrt{937.5 - w^2}$, $w = 74 + \sqrt{937.5 - w^2}$, and $w = 75 - x$.
## Step 12:  We then calculate the area of this region using the formula for the area of a region bounded by curves.
## Step 13:  The area is given by the integral of the difference between the upper and lower bounding curves, evaluated from the leftmost intersection point to the rightmost intersection point.
## Step 14:  After evaluating the integral, we find that the area of the region is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \sqrt{937.5} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{3}\sqrt{375} = 125\sqrt{3}$.
## Step 15:  Therefore, the area of the finite region is $125\sqrt{3}$, and the sum of the coefficients is $125+3 = \boxed{128}$.

Find the expected number of regions into which these 27 line segments divide the disk.",204,12,,,"## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand how the line segments divide the disk and how many regions they create.
## Step 2:  First, we note that the two perpendicular diameters divide the disk into 4 quadrants, creating 4 regions.
## Step 3:  Each additional line segment that is drawn through the disk will intersect with the existing segments and the diameters, creating new regions.
## Step 4:  The first line segment will intersect the two diameters, creating 4 new regions, for a total of 8 regions.
## Step 5:  The second line segment will intersect the first line segment and the two diameters, creating 6 new regions, for a total of 14 regions.
## Step 6:  The third line segment will intersect the first two line segments and the two diameters, creating 8 new regions, for a total of 22 regions.
## Step 7:  The fourth line segment will intersect the first three line segments and the two diameters, creating 10 new regions, for a total of 32 regions.
## Step 8:  We can see a pattern emerging where each new line segment adds 2 more regions than the previous one.
## Step 9:  Therefore, we can express the total number of regions created by the first n line segments as 4 + 2n + 2(n-1) + 2(n-2) + ... + 2.
## Step 10:  This is an arithmetic series with a first term of 4, a common difference of 2, and n terms.
## Step 11:  The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula S = n/2 * (a1 + an), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.
## Step 12:  In this case, the sum of the regions created by the first n line segments is S = n/2 * (4 + 2n).
## Step 13:  We are given that there are 27 line segments, so we can substitute n = 27 into the formula to find the total number of regions.
## Step 14:  Plugging in n = 27, we get S = 27/2 * (4 + 2*27) = 27/2 * (4 + 54) = 27/2 * 58 = 783.
## Step 15:  However, we need to add the initial 4 regions created by the two diameters, so the total number of regions is 783 + 4 = 787.

## Step 2:  We start by considering the properties of the sum of cubes. We know that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \equiv 0 \pmod{3^7}$, which means that the sum of the cubes of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is a multiple of $3^7$.
## Step 3:  We can use the fact that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \equiv a + b + c \pmod{3}$ to simplify the problem. This means that the sum of the cubes is congruent to the sum of the numbers modulo $3$.
## Step 4:  We then consider the possible values of $a + b + c$ modulo $3$. We find that $a + b + c$ can be congruent to $0$, $1$, or $2$ modulo $3$.

## Step 8:  For the case where $a + b + c \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$, we find that there are $3^6 \cdot 3^6 \cdot 3^6 - 3^6 \cdot 3^6 = 2 \cdot 3^{18} - 3^{18} = 3^{18}$ possible ordered triples.

Find the area of $ \triangle BGE $.",468,15,,,"To find the area of $\triangle BGE$, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given the coordinates of its vertices. However, in this case, we can use vectors and the cross product to find the area.

Let $\mathbf{A}$, $\mathbf{B}$, $\mathbf{C}$, $\mathbf{D}$, $\mathbf{E}$, $\mathbf{F}$, $\mathbf{G}$ be the position vectors of the respective points. We are given $AC = 26$, $BD = 22$, $CE = 31$, $DF = 33$, $AF = 73$,  $CG = 40$, and $DG = 30$. To start, we denote $\mathbf{A}$ as $0$, and the rest are determined as shown below.

We have $\mathbf{B} = AC\cdot \frac{BD}{AC}$ =  $26 \cdot \dfrac{22}{26}  = 22.$
$\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{B} + AC= \mathbf{B} + 26.$
$\mathbf{D} = \mathbf{C} + BD = (\mathbf{B}+26)+22 = (\mathbf{B}+22)+26.$
$\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{D} + CE = (\mathbf{B}+22)+ 31 = \mathbf{B} + 53.$
$\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{AA}+\mathbf{AC}+\mathbf{AE} = 73.$

$\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{B} + 53 +26  = \mathbf{B} + 79.$
We have $AF = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{B}\mathbf{F} = 79.$
Given $CG=40$, $\mathbf{G} = \mathbf{C} + 40 =  \mathbf{B} +  66  $.
This matches our given value of $\mathbf{B} +  66$ for $\mathbf{G}$, but used a variable so we made an equation our variable equals it by performing an addition equation.
With that let $$\mathbf{A}\mathbf{C} = 40$$. Therefore $$\mathbf{B}\mathbf{G}\cdot (\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{E}) = \dfrac{1}{2}\cdot||\mathbf{A}\mathbf{C}\times \mathbf{C}\mathbf{E} || = \text{Area of }\triangle\text{ACE}$$ $$=\dfrac{1}{2}\cdot(40\times 31)=\text{Area of }\triangle\text{ACE}.$$ Using
$$\mathbf{G}\mathbf{D}=-60=-(\text{the distance between}\mathbf{B}\text{and diaerms})$$ because the two shapes are equal by this theory and we can solve for the area with our given formulas.

$$\dfrac{1}{2}\cdot 31\times 22 = \text{Area of }\triangle \text{ACE}$$ Therefore $\text{Area of }\triangle \text{BGE} =  \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot31\cdot33$.

We need to find all positive integers $n$ such that $n + 2$ divides the product $3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9)$.

## Step 2: Factor the expression
The expression $3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9)$ can be factored as $3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) = 3(n + 3)(n + 3)(n - 3) = 3^2(n + 3)^2(n - 3)$.

## Step 3: Determine the condition for divisibility
For $n + 2$ to divide $3^2(n + 3)^2(n - 3)$, $n + 2$ must divide $3^2(n + 3)^2$ or $n - 3$.

## Step 4: Consider the case when $n + 2$ divides $3^2(n + 3)^2$
Since $n + 2$ is a factor of $3^2(n + 3)^2$, we can write $n + 2 = 3k$ for some integer $k$. This implies $n = 3k - 2$.

## Step 5: Consider the case when $n + 2$ divides $n - 3$
If $n + 2$ divides $n - 3$, then $n + 2$ must divide $-5$. However, since $n + 2$ is a positive integer, this is impossible.

## Step 6: Solve for $n$ in the first case
Substituting $n = 3k - 2$ into the expression $3^2(n + 3)^2(n - 3)$, we get $3^2(3k - 2 + 3)^2(3k - 2 - 3) = 3^2(3k + 1)^2(3k - 5)$. We need to find the values of $k$ such that $n + 2 = 3k$ divides $3^2(3k + 1)^2(3k - 5)$.

## Step 7: Simplify the expression
Since $n + 2 = 3k$ divides $3^2(3k + 1)^2(3k - 5)$, we can write $3k$ divides $3^2(3k + 1)^2(3k - 5)$. This implies $k$ divides $(3k + 1)^2(3k - 5)$.

## Step 8: Find the values of $k$ that satisfy the condition
We can try different values of $k$ to find the ones that satisfy the condition. We can start with $k = 1$ and check if it satisfies the condition.

## Step 9: Check $k = 1$
If $k = 1$, then $n = 3(1) - 2 = 1$. We can check if $n + 2 = 3$ divides $3^2(3(1) + 1)^2(3(1) - 5) = 3^2(4)^2(-2) = 3^2(16)(-2) = -144$. Since $3$ divides $-144$, $n = 1$ is a solution.

## Step 10: Check $k = 2$
If $k = 2$, then $n = 3(2) - 2 = 4$. We can check if $n + 2 = 6$ divides $3^2(3(2) + 1)^2(3(2) - 5) = 3^2(7)^2(-1) = 3^2(49)(-1) = -441$. Since $6$ does not divide $-441$, $n = 4$ is not a solution.

## Step 11: Check $k = 3$
If $k = 3$, then $n = 3(3) - 2 = 7$. We can check if $n + 2 = 9$ divides $3^2(3(3) + 1)^2(3(3) - 5) = 3^2(10)^2(4) = 3^2(100)(4) = 1200$. Since $9$ divides $1200$, $n = 7$ is a solution.

## Step 12: Check $k = 4$
If $k = 4$, then $n = 3(4) - 2 = 10$. We can check if $n + 2 = 12$ divides $3^2(3(4) + 1)^2(3(4) - 5) = 3^2(13)^2(7) = 3^2(169)(7) = 3975$. Since $12$ does not divide $3975$, $n = 10$ is not a solution.

## Step 13: Check $k = 5$
If $k = 5$, then $n = 3(5) - 2 = 13$. We can check if $n + 2 = 15$ divides $3^2(3(5) + 1)^2(3(5) - 5) = 3^2(16)^2(10) = 3^2(256)(10) = 7680$. Since $15$ divides $7680$, $n = 13$ is a solution.

## Step 14: Check $k = 6$
If $k = 6$, then $n = 3(6) - 2 = 16$. We can check if $n + 2 = 18$ divides $3^2(3(6) + 1)^2(3(6) - 5) = 3^2(19)^2(13) = 3^2(361)(13) = 15093$. Since $18$ does not divide $15093$, $n = 16$ is not a solution.

## Step 15: Check $k = 7$
If $k = 7$, then $n = 3(7) - 2 = 19$. We can check if $n + 2 = 21$ divides $3^2(3(7) + 1)^2(3(7) - 5) = 3^2(22)^2(16) = 3^2(484)(16) = 23328$. Since $21$ divides $23328$, $n = 19$ is a solution.

## Step 16: Check $k = 8$
If $k = 8$, then $n = 3(8) - 2 = 22$. We can check if $n + 2 = 24$ divides $3^2(3(8) + 1)^2(3(8) - 5) = 3^2(25)^2(17) = 3^2(625)(17) = 32775$. Since $24$ does not divide $32775$, $n = 22$ is not a solution.

If $k = 9$, then $n = 3(9) - 2 = 25$. We can check if $n + 2 = 27$ divides $3^2(3(9) + 1)^2(3(9) - 5) = 3^2(28)^2(20) = 3^2(784)(20) = 47040$. Since $27$ divides $47040$, $n = 25$ is a solution.

## Step 18: Check $k = 10$
If $k = 10$, then $n = 3(10) - 2 = 28$. We can check if $n + 2 = 30$ divides $3^2(3(10) + 1)^2(3(10) - 5) = 3^2(31)^2(25) = 3^2(961)(25) = 72675$. Since $30$ does not divide $72675$, $n = 28$ is not a solution.

## Step 19: Check $k = 11$
If $k = 11$, then $n = 3(11) - 2 = 31$. We can check if $n + 2 = 33$ divides $3^2(3(11) + 1)^2(3(11) - 5) = 3^2(34)^2(26) = 3^2(1156)(26) = 92320$. Since $33$ divides $92320$, $n = 31$ is a solution.

## Step 20: Check $k = 12$
If $k = 12$, then $n = 3(12) - 2 = 34$. We can check if $n + 2 = 36$ divides $3^2(3(12) + 1)^2(3(12) - 5) = 3^2(37)^2(31) = 3^2(1369)(31) = 127637$. Since $36$ does not divide $127637$, $n = 34$ is not a solution.

## Step 21: Check $k = 13$
If $k = 13$, then $n = 3(13) - 2 = 37$. We can check if $n + 2 = 39$ divides $3^2(3(13) + 1)^2(3(13) - 5) = 3^2(40)^2(34) = 3^2(1600)(34) = 172800$. Since $39$ divides $172800$, $n = 37$ is a solution.

## Step 22: Check $k = 14$
If $k = 14$, then $n = 3(14) - 2 = 40$. We can check if $n + 2 = 42$ divides $3^2(3(14) + 1)^2(3(14) - 5) = 3^2(41)^2(37) = 3^2(1681)(37) = 184413$. Since $42$ does not divide $184413$, $n = 40$ is not a solution.

## Step 23: Check $k = 15$
If $k = 15$, then $n = 3(15) - 2 = 43$. We can check if $n + 2 = 45$ divides $3^2(3(15) + 1)^2(3(15) - 5) = 3^2(44)^2(40) = 3^2(1936)(40) = 233280$. Since $45$ divides $233280$, $n = 43$ is a solution.

## Step 24: Check $k = 16$
If $k = 16$, then $n = 3(16) - 2 = 46$. We can check if $n + 2 = 48$ divides $3^2(3(16) + 1)^2(3(16) - 5) = 3^2(47)^2(43) = 3^2(2209)(43) = 456813$. Since $48$ does not divide $456813$, $n = 46$ is not a solution.

## Step 25: Check $k = 17$
If $k = 17$, then $n = 3(17) - 2 = 49$. We can check if $n + 2 = 51$ divides $3^2(3(17) + 1)^2(3(17) - 5) = 3^2(50)^2(44) = 3^2(2500)(44) = 330000$. Since $51$ divides $330000$, $n = 49$ is a solution.

## Step 26: Check $k = 18$
If $k = 18$, then $n = 3(18) - 2 = 52$. We can check if $n + 2 = 54$ divides $3^2(3(18) + 1)^2(3(18) - 5) = 3^2(51)^2(47) = 3^2(2601)(47) = 368113$. Since $54$ does not divide $368113$, $n = 52$ is not a solution.

## Step 27: Check $k = 19$
If $k = 19$, then $n = 3(19) - 2 = 55$. We can check if $n + 2 = 57$ divides $3^2(3(19) + 1)^2(3(19) - 5) = 3^2(52)^2(50) = 3^2(2704)(50) = 405600$. Since $57$ divides $405600$, $n = 55$ is a solution.

## Step 28: Check $k = 20$

AIME,AIME,meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct,Four unit squares form a $2 \times 2$ grid. Each of the 12 unit line segments forming the sides of the squares is colored either red or blue in such a way that each unit square has 2 red sides and 2 blue sides. Find the number of such colorings.,82,17,,,"## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the different ways in which the 2x2 grid of unit squares can be colored with red and blue lines such that each unit square has 2 red sides and 2 blue sides.
## Step 2:  We can start by considering the coloring of the four corner squares. Since each square must have 2 red sides and 2 blue sides, the coloring of the corners is fixed, with each corner square having one red and one blue side.
## Step 3:  Next, we need to consider the coloring of the middle squares. There are two cases to consider: one where the middle squares are the same color and one where they are different colors.
## Step 4:  In the case where the middle squares are the same color, there are two possibilities: either both are red or both are blue. If they are the same color, there are 2 ways to color the middle squares.
## Step 5:  In the case where the middle squares are different colors, there are two possibilities: either the top middle square is red and the bottom middle square is blue, or vice versa. In each of these cases, there are 2 ways to color the middle squares.
## Step 6:  Now, we need to consider the coloring of the sides of the squares. Since each square has 2 red sides and 2 blue sides, the coloring of the sides is determined by the coloring of the corners and the middle squares.
## Step 7:  For each of the 2 cases where the middle squares are the same color, there are 2 ways to color the sides of the squares.
## Step 8:  For each of the 2 cases where the middle squares are different colors, there are 2 ways to color the sides of the squares.
## Step 9:  Therefore, the total number of colorings is the sum of the number of colorings in each case, which is 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$",8.0,0,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Find $ m + n $.",106,18,,,"## Step 1:  The problem involves finding the product of several logarithmic expressions, which can be simplified using the properties of logarithms.
## Step 2:  We start by examining the given product and simplifying each term using the change-of-base formula for logarithms, which states that $\log_a b = \frac{\log_c b}{\log_c a}$ for any positive real numbers $a, b,$ and $c.$
## Step 3:  Applying the change-of-base formula to the given product, we can rewrite each term as $\frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})} = \frac{\frac{\log 5^{k^2-1}}{\log k}}{\frac{\log 5^{k^2-4}}{\log (k+1)}} = \frac{\log 5^{k^2-1}}{\log k} \cdot \frac{\log (k+1)}{\log 5^{k^2-4}} = \frac{k^2-1}{\log k} \cdot \frac{\log (k+1)}{k^2-4}.$
## Step 4:  This simplification allows us to express the product in a more manageable form, which we can then further simplify by canceling out common terms.
## Step 5:  After canceling out the common terms, we are left with the expression $\frac{60\log 65}{\log 4} \cdot \frac{63 \log 64}{61 \log 5}.$
## Step 6:  We can then simplify this expression by using the properties of logarithms to obtain the final value of the product.
## Step 7:  By simplifying the expression, we find that the product is equal to $\frac{5 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 \cdot 7 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5 \cdot 3^6}{2^6 \cdot 5 \cdot 61} = \frac{11 \cdot 13 \cdot 7 \cdot 3^9}{2^6 \cdot 61}.$
## Step 8:  Therefore, the final answer is $\frac{11 \cdot 13 \cdot 7 \cdot 3^9}{2^6 \cdot 61} = \frac{3003}{192}.$
## Step 9:  Hence, the sum of the numerator and denominator is $3003 + 192 = \boxed{3195}.$

## Step 2:  The prime factorization of 2025 is $3^4 \cdot 5^2$. This means that any divisor of 2025 can be expressed in the form $3^a \cdot 5^b$, where $0 \le a \le 4$ and $0 \le b \le 2$.
## Step 3:  Therefore, the set $A$ consists of all possible combinations of $3^a \cdot 5^b$ for $0 \le a \le 4$ and $0 \le b \le 2$.

He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.

Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.",610,22,,,"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.

First, let's recall how the greedy algorithm works for this problem. The greedy algorithm successively chooses the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of the collection to exceed N.

To identify the cases where the greedy algorithm fails, we need to find the values of N for which it would use more coins than necessary.

To do this, we can analyze the number of times the greedy algorithm selects a certain aspect in its selection (this certain aspect is a 25-cent coin). It does so exactly when N is divisible by 25 so that the algorithm selects a 25-cent coin only once, and then when certain conditions on the numbers below 25 (to do so when computing N mod 25) are satisfied.

For $ t $ of these $ n $ values of $ x $, the graph of $ y = f(x) $ is tangent to the $ x $-axis. Find $ n + t $.",149,23,,,"## Step 1:  To solve the given problem, we need to find the values of $x$ in the interval $0 < x < 2\pi$ where the function $f(x) = \sin(7\pi \cdot \sin(5x)) = 0$.
## Step 2:  We start by understanding that for the function $f(x)$ to be equal to $0$, the argument of the sine function, $7\pi \cdot \sin(5x)$, must be an integer multiple of $\pi$. This leads us to the equation $7\pi \cdot \sin(5x) = k\pi$, where $k$ is an integer.
## Step 3:  Simplifying this equation, we get $\sin(5x) = \frac{k}{7}$.
## Step 4:  We know that the sine function has a period of $2\pi$, so we need to find the values of $x$ in the interval $0 < x < 2\pi$ that satisfy the equation $\sin(5x) = \frac{k}{7}$.
## Step 5:  The sine function is equal to $\frac{k}{7}$ for $k = \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 4, \pm 5, \pm 6$. This gives us a total of 12 possible values of $k$.
## Step 6:  For each of these values of $k$, we need to find the number of solutions to the equation $\sin(5x) = \frac{k}{7}$ in the interval $0 < x < 2\pi$.
## Step 7:  The sine function is equal to $\frac{k}{7}$ for 14 values of $x$ in the interval $0 < x < 2\pi$ for each of the 12 values of $k$.
## Step 8:  Therefore, the total number of solutions to the equation $f(x) = 0$ in the interval $0 < x < 2\pi$ is $12 \cdot 14 = 168$.
## Step 9:  However, we need to consider the values of $x$ for which the graph of $y = f(x)$ is tangent to the $x$-axis. This occurs when the derivative of $f(x)$ is equal to $0$.
## Step 10:  The derivative of $f(x)$ is given by $f'(x) = 7\pi \cdot 5\cos(5x)\cos(7\pi \cdot \sin(5x))$.
## Step 11:  We need to find the values of $x$ in the interval $0 < x < 2\pi$ for which $f'(x) = 0$.
## Step 12:  This occurs when $\cos(5x) = 0$ or $\cos(7\pi \cdot \sin(5x)) = 0$.
## Step 13:  The cosine function is equal to $0$ for 2 values of $x$ in the interval $0 < x < 2\pi$.
## Step 14:  The cosine function is equal to $0$ for 2 values of $x$ in the interval $0 < x < 2\pi$.

Find the remainder when $ N $ is divided by 1000.,907,24,,,"## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the arrangement of chairs and people in a way that satisfies the given condition.
## Step 2:  We are given 16 chairs in a row and 8 people who need to select a chair to sit in such that no person sits next to two other people.
## Step 3:  The problem can be approached by considering the arrangement of people and empty chairs as a string of 16 characters, where 8 characters are people and 8 characters are empty chairs.
## Step 4:  The condition that no person sits next to two other people translates to the requirement that there should be at least one empty chair between any two people.
## Step 5:  This can be represented as a string of 16 characters, where 8 characters are people and 8 characters are empty chairs, with the constraint that there should be at least one empty chair between any two people.
## Step 6:  To count the number of valid arrangements, we can use the concept of ""stars and bars"" or ""balls and urns,"" which is a combinatorial technique used to count the number of ways to distribute objects into bins.
## Step 7:  In this case, we have 8 people (stars) and 8 empty chairs (bars), and we need to distribute them in a way that satisfies the given condition.
## Step 8:  The number of ways to arrange the people and empty chairs can be calculated using the formula for combinations with repetition, which is given by $\binom{n+k}{k}$, where $n$ is the number of objects (people or chairs) and $k$ is the number of bins (empty chairs).
## Step 9:  In this case, we have $n=8$ (people) and $k=8$ (empty chairs), so the number of ways to arrange them is $\binom{16}{8}$.
## Step 10:  However, we need to consider the constraint that there should be at least one empty chair between any two people.
## Step 11:  To do this, we can use the concept of ""complementary counting,"" where we count the number of arrangements that do not satisfy the condition and subtract it from the total number of arrangements.
## Step 12:  The number of arrangements that do not satisfy the condition is the number of ways to arrange the people and empty chairs without any empty chairs between them, which is $\binom{8+8-1}{8} = \binom{15}{8}$.
## Step 13:  Therefore, the number of valid arrangements is $\binom{16}{8} - \binom{15}{8}$.
## Step 14:  We can calculate this using the formula for combinations: $\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$.
## Step 15:  Plugging in the values, we get $\binom{16}{8} = \frac{16!}{8!8!}$ and $\binom{15}{8} = \frac{15!}{8!7!}$.

## Step 2:  Points $K$ and $L$ are located inside the triangle such that $AK = AL = BK = CL = KL = 14$. This implies that $K$ and $L$ are equidistant from the vertices of the triangle, forming a smaller square within the triangle.
## Step 3:  We are asked to find the area of the quadrilateral $BKLC$, which is formed by connecting points $B$, $K$, $L$, and $C$.
## Step 4:  To approach this problem, we can start by finding the area of the entire triangle $ABC$ and then subtract the area of the smaller square formed by points $K$ and $L$ to obtain the area of quadrilateral $BKLC$.
## Step 5:  We can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is given by $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$, to find the area of triangle $ABC$.

## Step 11:  The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
## Step 12:  Applying the Pythagorean theorem to triangle $ABC$, we have $AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2$. Since $AB = 14\sqrt{3}$ and $BC = 38$, we can solve for $AC$.
## Step 13:  Once we have the value of $AC$, we can use it to find the area of triangle $ABC$ using the formula $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$.

## Step 14:  Next, we need to find the area of the smaller square formed by points $K$ and $L$. Since the side length of the square is $14$, we can easily calculate its area by squaring the side length.

## Step 15:  By subtracting the area of the smaller square from the area of triangle $ABC$, we can obtain the area of quadrilateral $BKLC$.

## Step 16:  Finally, we need to express the area of quadrilateral $BKLC$ in the form $n\sqrt{3}$, where $n$ is a positive integer, and find the value of $n$.

## Step 17:  After performing the necessary calculations, we can express the area of quadrilateral $BKLC$ as $n\sqrt{3}$ and find the value of $n$.

## Step 18:  The final step is to calculate the value of $n$ based on the area of quadrilateral $BKLC$.

## Step 19:  After obtaining the area of quadrilateral $BKLC$, we can express it in the form $n\sqrt{3}$ and find the value of $n$.

## Step 20:  The value of $n$ will be the final answer to the problem.

The final answer is: $\boxed{323}$",323.0,0,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AIME,AIME,meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct,"There are exactly three positive real numbers $ k $ such that the function

defined over the positive real numbers achieves its minimum value at exactly two positive real numbers $ x $. Find the sum of these three values of $ k $.",240,29,,,"To find the values of $k$ for which $f(x)$ achieves its minimum value at exactly two positive real numbers $x$, we need to understand that $f'(x)$ represents the rate of change of $f(x)$, and $f'(x) = 0$ indicates the critical points of $f(x)$. Since $f(x)$ is a rational function, the expression for $f'(x)$ will be quite involved. However, we want to find a way to analyze the behavior of $f'(x)$ without explicit calculation.

We are looking for a situation where $f(x)$ has its minimum at exactly two points, which means that there are two inflection points where the concavity of the function changes, with no other inflection points in between.

Consider that the numerator of $f(x)$ can be rewritten as
$$(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k)=\\(x^2 - 90x + 1314)(x - k).$$

For this expression, call any $a$ and $b$ as roots of the quadratic part $x^2 - 90x + 1314.$ Note that both $18,72,98$ and $k$ can also be considered roots of this entire equation, as their value results in f(x) being undefined ($\frac{undefined \times (something)}{x}$).

If the sum of $a$ and $b$ is $90$, the quadratic is equal to 0 for $x^2 - 90x + 1314$ = $(x - a)(x - b)$ = $x^2 - 90x + 90a + 90 b -ab$ and constant term $ab = 1314.$table of values

By this above, with inflection points changing each time the second derivative $\\frac{{-2 +2\frac{x- 72}{x - 18}\frac{x- 98}{x} + \frac{-4}{x}\left(-18)(100)(x -k)(18 - k)\right)(x - 98)(x - k)^2}}{x^2}\\$

Each critical point $\\frac{x-72}{x- 18}$ contributes an upper or lower change with its opposite accompanying point causing the upper equation's above- solution invalid atop, and lower solution finding points, leaving it incredibly equivalent and so the only three solution found here equals $$\boxed{270+ 198+18=486}$$",486.0,0,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
