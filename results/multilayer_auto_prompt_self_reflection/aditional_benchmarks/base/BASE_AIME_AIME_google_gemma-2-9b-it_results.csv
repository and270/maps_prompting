AIME,AIME,google/gemma-2-9b-it,Find the sum of all integer bases $b>9$ for which $17_{b}$ is a divisor of $97_{b}$.,70,0,,,"Here's how to solve the problem:

**Understanding Base Conversion**

*  The number $17_b$ means  $(1 \times b^1) + (7 \times b^0) = b + 7$.
*  The number $97_b$ means $(9 \times b^1) + (7 \times b^0) = 9b + 7$.

**Setting up the Divisibility Condition**

We are given that $17_b$ divides $97_b$.  This means:

 $$9b + 7 = k(b + 7)$$

where $k$ is an integer.

**Solving for b**

1. Expand the equation:  $9b + 7 = kb + 7k$

2. Rearrange to group terms: $9b - kb = 7k - 7$

3. Factor out $b$: $b(9 - k) = 7(k - 1)$

For this equation to hold, both sides must be divisible by the same factors.  Since $b$ is an integer base greater than 9, we need to consider the factors of 7 and the possible values of $k$.

* **Factors of 7:** The only factors of 7 are 1 and 7.

* **Possible values of k:**  Since $b > 9$,  $9-k$ must be a factor of 7. This means $k$ could be 2 or 10.

**Finding the Bases**

* **Case 1: k = 2**
   *  $b(9-2) = 7(2-1)$
   *  $7b = 7$
   *  $b = 1$ (This solution is not valid since $b > 9$)

* **Case 2: k = 10**
   * $b(9-10) = 7(10-1)$
   * $-b = 63$
   * $b = -63$ (This solution is not valid since $b$ must be positive)



Since we didn't find any valid solutions for $b$, the sum of all such bases is **0**.

**Understanding the Problem**

We are given a triangle ABC with points D, E, and B on side AB, and points A, F, G, and C on side AC. We are also given information about the lengths of these segments and the area of quadrilateral DEGF.  We need to find the area of heptagon AFNBCEM.

**Key Idea**

The key to solving this problem is to realize that the reflections M and N divide the quadrilateral DEGF into simpler shapes whose areas we can calculate.

**Solution**

1. **Area of DEGF:** We are given that the area of DEGF is 288.

2. **Reflections:**
   * Since M is the reflection of D through F, line segment DF is the perpendicular bisector of DE.
   * Similarly, line segment EG is the perpendicular bisector of FG.

3. **Dividing DEGF:**  The reflections M and N divide quadrilateral DEGF into four triangles:
   *  ΔDFM
   *  ΔFGM
   *  ΔEGN
   *  ΔDGE

4. **Calculating Areas:**
   *  We can find the areas of triangles ΔDFM, ΔFGM, and ΔEGN using the formula (1/2) * base * height.  The bases are DF, FG, and EG respectively, and the heights are the perpendicular distances from M, G, and N to the respective bases.
   *  The area of triangle ΔDGE is simply the area of DEGF minus the sum of the areas of the other three triangles.

5. **Area of AFNBCEM:**
   *  The area of heptagon AFNBCEM is the sum of the areas of triangle ABC and the four triangles we calculated in step 4.

**Note:** To find the exact numerical answer, you'll need to calculate the heights of the triangles using the given information about the lengths of the segments.

At least one player chose each flavor, and the number of players who chose chocolate was greater than the number of players who chose vanilla, which was greater than the number of players who chose strawberry. Let $N$ be the number of different assignments of flavors to players that meet these conditions. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by 1000.",16,2,,,"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1.  Consider the Relative Counts**

* Let  'c' be the number of players who chose chocolate.
* Let 'v' be the number of players who chose vanilla.
* Let 's' be the number of players who chose strawberry.

We know:

*  c > v > s 
* c + v + s = 9

**2.  Find Possible Combinations**

Since at least one player chose each flavor, the smallest possible values are:

* c = 4
* v = 3
* s = 2

The largest possible values are:

* c = 8
* v = 0
* s = 1

**3.  Calculate the Number of Assignments**

For each possible combination of (c, v, s), we need to figure out how many ways to assign the flavors to the players.  

* **Think of it like this:** Imagine 9 slots representing the players. We need to place 'c' chocolate scoops, 'v' vanilla scoops, and 's' strawberry scoops into these slots.

* **Stars and Bars Method:** This type of problem can be solved using a technique called ""stars and bars"".  We can represent the scoops as stars (*) and the separations between flavors as bars (|). For example, if c=4, v=3, and s=2, we'd have:

   `****|***|**`

* **Counting Arrangements:** To find the number of arrangements, we need to figure out how many ways we can arrange these stars and bars.  There are a total of 14 positions (9 stars and 5 bars), and we need to choose 5 of them to be bars. This can be done in  ¹⁴C₅ ways (14 choose 5), which is calculated as:

   ¹⁴C₅ = 14! / (5! * 9!) = 2002

**4.  Sum the Possibilities**

We need to calculate the number of arrangements for all possible combinations of (c, v, s) and sum them up.  This can be a bit tedious, but you'll find that the sum of the arrangements for all valid combinations will give you the value of N.

The given equation is a quadratic in terms of  'x'.  We can factor it:

 $$12x^2 - xy - 6y^2 = 0$$
 $$x(12x - y) - 6y^2 = 0$$
 $$x(12x - y) = 6y^2$$

**2. Analyze the Factors**

*  Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, $x$ and $(12x-y)$ must be factors of $6y^2$. 

*  Consider the prime factorization of 6:  $6 = 2 \cdot 3$.  The factors of $6y^2$ will involve combinations of 2, 3, and $y$.

**3.  Casework**

We'll use casework to examine the possible values of $x$ and $y$:

* **Case 1:  x = 0** 
   If $x=0$, the equation becomes $0 = 6y^2$, which means $y=0$. This gives us one solution: $(0,0)$.

* **Case 2: x is a factor of 6y²**
    *  Let's say $x = 2a$, where 'a' is an integer. Then, $2a(12 \cdot 2a - y) = 6y^2$. Simplifying, we get $48a^2 - 2ay = 6y^2$.  We need to find values of 'a' and 'y' that satisfy this equation.

* **Case 3: x is a factor of y²**
    *  If $x$ is a factor of $y^2$, then $x = by^2$, where 'b' is an integer. Substitute this into the original equation and solve for 'b' and 'y'.

**Understanding Divisibility Rules**

* **Divisibility by 2:** A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even.
* **Divisibility by 11:** A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits at odd places and the sum of the digits at even places is either 0 or a multiple of 11.

**Applying the Rules**

1. **Divisibility by 2:**  Since we need the number to be divisible by 2, the last digit must be even (2, 4, 6, or 8). This gives us 4 choices for the last digit.

2. **Divisibility by 11:**  Let's represent the eight-digit number as:  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

   * Sum of digits at odd places:  _ + _ + _ + _ 
   * Sum of digits at even places: _ + _ + _ + _

   We need the difference between these sums to be divisible by 11.  We'll need to consider all possible combinations of digits to find the ones that satisfy this condition.

* **Inscribed Circle:** A circle that fits inside the trapezoid, touching all four sides.

**2. Key Relationships**

* **Tangents and Radii:**  The radius of the inscribed circle is perpendicular to the tangents it touches. This means we can draw perpendiculars from the center of the circle to each side of the trapezoid.
* **Area of a Trapezoid:**  The area of a trapezoid is  (1/2) * height * (base1 + base2)

**3. Setting up the Solution**

* Draw the perpendiculars from the center of the circle to the bases of the trapezoid. These perpendiculars divide the trapezoid into smaller shapes.
* You'll notice that the inscribed circle creates four right triangles.

**Understanding the Problem**

We are given a system of equations involving complex numbers.  The first equation defines a circle in the complex plane, and the second equation defines a set of points equidistant from two complex numbers. Our goal is to find the values of *k* that make this system have exactly one solution.

**Solving the System**

* **Equation 1:**  
   The equation  $|25 + 20i - z| = 5$ represents all complex numbers *z* that are 5 units away from the complex number 25 + 20*i*. This defines a circle in the complex plane.

* **Equation 2:**
   The equation $|z - 4 - k| = |z - 3i - k|$ represents all complex numbers *z* that are equidistant from the points 4 + *k* and 3*i* + *k*. This defines a perpendicular bisector of the line segment connecting these two points.

**Finding the Intersection**

For the system to have exactly one solution, the circle defined by Equation 1 must intersect the perpendicular bisector defined by Equation 2 at exactly one point. This means the center of the circle and the midpoint of the line segment connecting 4 + *k* and 3*i* + *k* must be collinear.

**Calculations**

1. **Midpoint:** The midpoint of the line segment connecting 4 + *k* and 3*i* + *k* is  ((4 + 4 + k)/2, (0 + 3 + k)/2) = (4 + k/2, (3 + k)/2).

2. **Collinearity:**  The center of the circle is 25 + 20*i*. For the center and midpoint to be collinear, the direction vector of the line passing through them must be a scalar multiple of the direction vector of the line segment connecting 4 + *k* and 3*i* + *k*.

3. **Direction Vectors:**
   * Direction vector of the line segment: (3*i* + *k* - 4 - *k*) = 3*i* - 4
   * Direction vector of the line passing through the center and midpoint: (4 + k/2 - 25 - 20*i*, (3 + k)/2 - 20*i*) = (-21 + k/2, (3 + k)/2 - 20*i*)

4. **Scalar Multiple:**  We need to find a scalar *t* such that:
   (-21 + k/2, (3 + k)/2 - 20*i*) = *t*(3*i* - 4)

   This gives us two equations:
   * -21 + k/2 = -4*t
   * (3 + k)/2 - 20*i* = 3*i*t

5. **Solving for k:** Solve the system of equations for *k*. This will involve some algebraic manipulation and potentially using the fact that *t* is a real number.

**1. Understand the Rotation**

Rotating a point counterclockwise around the origin by $60^\circ$ can be represented by the following transformation:

*  $x' = x \cos 60^\circ - y \sin 60^\circ = \frac{x}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}y}{2}$
*  $y' = x \sin 60^\circ + y \cos 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}x}{2} + \frac{y}{2}$

**2. Substitute and Simplify**

We want to find the intersection point of the original parabola ($y = x^2 - 4$) and its rotated image.  

* **Substitute:** Substitute the expressions for $x'$ and $y'$ into the equation of the parabola:
   
   $y' = (x')^2 - 4$

   $\frac{\sqrt{3}x}{2} + \frac{y}{2} = \left(\frac{x}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}y}{2}\right)^2 - 4$

* **Expand and Simplify:** Expand the right side and simplify the equation. You'll get a new equation relating $x'$ and $y'$.

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the number of ways to arrange the numbers 1 through 9 in a 3x9 grid, following Sudoku rules.  This is a classic combinatorics problem.

**Breaking Down the Solution**

* **Step 1:  Consider the first row.** There are 9! (9 factorial) ways to arrange the 9 numbers in the first row.

* **Step 2:  Account for the blocks.**  Since each 3x3 block must also contain the numbers 1-9, we need to consider the arrangements within each block.  However, the problem statement implies that the blocks are already filled in a specific way, so we don't need to worry about their arrangements.

* **Step 3:  Consider the remaining rows.**  The remaining two rows can be filled in similarly to the first row.  

**The Catch**

The problem statement is designed to be a bit tricky.  The key is to realize that the 3x3 blocks are already filled in a specific way. This means we don't need to worry about the permutations within the blocks.

**The Answer**

Since each row can be filled in 9! ways, and there are three rows, the total number of ways to fill the grid is:

(9!)(9!)(9!) = 9!³

To express this in the desired form, we need to prime factorize 9!:

9! = 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 2⁷ * 3⁴ * 5 * 7

Therefore, 9!³ = (2⁷ * 3⁴ * 5 * 7)³

Expanding this, we get:

2²¹ * 3¹² * 5³ * 7³

So, p = 2, a = 21, q = 3, b = 12, r = 5, c = 3, and s = 7, d = 3.

Finally, p * a + q * b + r * c + s * d = (2 * 21) + (3 * 12) + (5 * 3) + (7 * 3) = 42 + 36 + 15 + 21 = **114**

Find $a+b+c+d$.",259,10,,,"Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Understanding the Function**

The function $f(x)$ is defined in two pieces:

*  For  $-1 \le x < 1$,  $f(x) = x$
*  For $1 \le x < 3$, $f(x) = 2-x$

Since $f(x+4) = f(x)$, the graph of $f(x)$ repeats every 4 units. This creates a sawtooth pattern.

**2. Analyzing the Parabola**

The parabola $x = 34y^2$ opens to the right.  We need to find where this parabola intersects the sawtooth pattern of $f(x)$.

**3. Finding Intersection Points**

* **Consider the interval -1 ≤ x < 1:**  In this interval, $f(x) = x$.  Substitute $x = 34y^2$ into this equation:
   
   $34y^2 = x$

* **Consider the interval 1 ≤ x < 3:** In this interval, $f(x) = 2-x$. Substitute $x = 34y^2$ into this equation:

**1. Understanding the Problem**

We are given a plane and three inequalities.  Our goal is to find the area of the finite region formed by the intersection of these constraints.

**2.  Visualizing the Solution**

* **The Plane:** The equation  $x + y + z = 75$ defines a plane in 3-dimensional space.

* **The Inequalities:** The inequalities $x - yz < y - zx < z - xy$ are a bit tricky.  They involve cross-terms, making it difficult to directly visualize the regions they define.

**3.  Simplifying the Inequalities**

Let's rearrange the inequalities to make them easier to work with:

*  $x - yz < y - zx  \Rightarrow x + zx - yz - y < 0 \Rightarrow x(1 + z) - y(z + 1) < 0$
*  $y - zx < z - xy \Rightarrow y + xy - zx - z < 0 \Rightarrow y(1 + x) - z(x + 1) < 0$
*  $z - xy < x - yz \Rightarrow z + yz - xy - x < 0 \Rightarrow z(1 + y) - x(y + 1) < 0$

**4.  Interpreting the Inequalities**

Notice that each inequality can be rewritten in the form:

* $(a)(1 + b) - (c)(b + 1) < 0$

This suggests that the inequalities might define regions based on the relative magnitudes of $a$, $b$, and $c$.  

**5.  Finding the Finite Region**

To find the finite region, we need to analyze the intersections of the inequalities and the plane.  This is best done graphically or using numerical methods.  

* **Graphical Approach:**  Plot the plane $x + y + z = 75$ and try to visualize the regions defined by the inequalities.  Look for the region that is bounded and has finite area.

* **Numerical Approach:**  Choose a range of values for $x$, $y$, and $z$ and test each point to see if it satisfies all three inequalities and lies on the plane.  This will help you identify the finite region.

**6.  Calculating the Area**

Once you've identified the finite region, you can calculate its area using standard techniques for double integrals or by breaking it down into simpler shapes.

**Note:** The exact calculations can be quite involved, but the key is to understand the geometric interpretation of the inequalities and the plane.

**Understanding the Problem**

* We start with a disk divided into 4 quadrants.

* We want to find the average number of regions created by 25 random line segments.

**Key Idea**

The key is to realize that each new line segment can divide the disk into a maximum of two new regions.  

**Calculation**

1. **Initial Regions:** The disk starts with 4 regions (the 4 quadrants).

2. **Adding Line Segments:**  Each of the 25 new line segments has the potential to divide the disk into two more regions.  

3. **Expected Regions:**  Therefore, the expected number of regions after adding the 25 line segments is:

Find $m+n+p$.",60,13,,,"Here's a solution to the problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're given a pentagon and asked to minimize the sum of distances from a point $X$ to each of its vertices. This is a classic geometric optimization problem.

**Key Insight**

The key to solving this problem is recognizing that the minimum value of  $f(X)$ is achieved when $X$ is the circumcenter of the pentagon.  The circumcenter is the point where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the pentagon intersect.

**Why the Circumcenter?**

* **Symmetry:** The circumcenter is the only point that is equidistant from all the vertices of a regular polygon.
* **Minimization:**  Since the sum of distances is minimized when all distances are equal, the circumcenter is the optimal location for point $X$.

**Calculations**

1. **Finding the Circumcenter:**  Finding the exact coordinates of the circumcenter can be a bit involved, but the key is to use the perpendicular bisector concept. You'll need to find the equations of the perpendicular bisectors of each side of the pentagon and then solve the system of equations to find their intersection point.

2. **Calculating f(X):** Once you have the coordinates of the circumcenter, substitute them into the expression for $f(X)$ to find the minimum value.

3. **Expressing the Answer:** Express the minimum value of $f(X)$ in the form $m + n\sqrt{p}$ as instructed.


**Note:** The calculations involved in finding the circumcenter and the final expression for $f(X)$ can be quite tedious. You might want to use a graphing calculator or computer algebra system to help with the calculations.

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the number of triples $(a,b,c)$ where:

*  Each number is a positive integer less than or equal to $3^6 = 729$.
* The sum of their cubes, $a^3 + b^3 + c^3$, is divisible by $3^7 = 2187$.

**Key Idea: Modular Arithmetic**

The problem can be solved using modular arithmetic.  We'll work with remainders when dividing by powers of 3.

* **Fact:** If $x \equiv y \pmod{m}$, then $x^n \equiv y^n \pmod{m}$ for any positive integer *n*.

**Solution**

1. **Reducing the Problem:** Since $a^3 + b^3 + c^3$ is divisible by $3^7$, we know:
   $$a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \equiv 0 \pmod{2187}$$

2. **Working with Smaller Moduli:**  Let's consider smaller powers of 3:

   * **Modulo 3:**  Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers less than or equal to 729, they are all congruent to 0, 1, or 2 modulo 3.  Therefore, their cubes are also congruent to 0, 1, or 2 modulo 3.  We can check all possible combinations of these residues to see when their sum is congruent to 0 modulo 3.

   * **Modulo 9:**  We can use a similar approach as above, considering the possible residues modulo 9.

   * **Modulo 27:**  Continue this process, working our way up to modulo 2187.

3. **Counting the Solutions:**  As you work through the moduli, you'll find a pattern.  For each modulus, you'll be able to determine the possible values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ that satisfy the congruence.  Keep track of these possibilities.

4. **Combining the Results:**  Once you have the possible values for $a$, $b$, and $c$ modulo each power of 3, you can combine them to find the solutions modulo 2187.  This will give you the number of ordered triples $N$.

5. **Finding the Remainder:** Finally, find the remainder when $N$ is divided by 1000.

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find all positive integers *n* that satisfy the given condition. This means that the expression  3(n + 3)(n² + 9) must be divisible by (n + 2).

   *  log<sub>k</sub>(5<sup>k² - 1</sup>) = (k² - 1) * log<sub>k</sub>(5)

**Understanding the Greedy Algorithm**

The greedy algorithm works by always choosing the largest denomination coin that can be used without exceeding the target value.  

**Analyzing the Algorithm's Success**

The greedy algorithm will succeed if and only if for every value of *N*, the number of coins it uses is minimal.  This means we need to find the values of *N* where using a combination of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins results in the same minimum number of coins as the greedy approach.

**Finding the Problem Cases**

The greedy algorithm is most likely to fail when:

* **Large multiples of 10 are involved:**  Since we can use 4 10-cent coins instead of 5 25-cent coins, the greedy algorithm might fail for values of *N* that are close to multiples of 10.

* **The difference between 25 and 10 is significant:**  The greedy algorithm might fail if the difference between the value of a 25-cent coin and a 10-cent coin is large enough to make it advantageous to use more 10-cent coins.

   We've overcounted the arrangements because rotating the entire 24-gon by any angle will result in the same arrangement of segments.  There are 24 ways to rotate the 24-gon.

**Final Calculation**

To get the correct number of unique arrangements, we divide the total number of arrangements by the number of rotations:

(²⁴C₁₂ * 12!) / 24 = (24! / (12! * 12!) * 12!) / 24 =  24! / (12! * 12! * 24)

Simplifying this expression gives us the final answer.  You can calculate this using a calculator or computer algebra system.

**Understanding the Problem**

We are given an 11-sided polygon with specific properties:

* **Area:** The area of each triangle formed by three consecutive vertices is 1.
* **Cosine:** The cosine of each angle formed by three consecutive vertices is 12/13.
* **Perimeter:** The total length of all sides of the polygon is 20.

We need to find the value of  $A_1A_2 + A_1A_{11}$ in a specific form and calculate the sum of its components.

**Solution**

1. **Law of Cosines:**  We can use the Law of Cosines to relate the sides and angles of the triangles.  Let $a_i = A_iA_{i+1}$ for $1 \le i \le 10$.  Then, for each $i$,
   
   $$a_{i-1}^2 = a_i^2 + a_{i+1}^2 - 2a_ia_{i+1}\cos(\angle A_iA_1A_{i+1})$$

2. **Substituting Values:** We know $a_i = a_{i+1} = 1$ and $\cos(\angle A_iA_1A_{i+1}) = \frac{12}{13}$. Substituting these values into the Law of Cosines, we get:

   $$a_{i-1}^2 = 1 + 1 - 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{12}{13} = \frac{1}{13}$$

3. **Finding  $A_1A_2 + A_1A_{11}$:**  Since $a_{10} = a_1 = A_1A_{11}$, we have:

   $$A_1A_2 + A_1A_{11} = a_1 + a_{10} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{13}} + \sqrt{\frac{1}{13}} = \frac{2\sqrt{13}}{13}$$

4. **Expressing in the Desired Form:**  We can rewrite the answer as $\frac{2\sqrt{13} - 0}{13}$.

5. **Calculating the Sum:**  Therefore, $m + n + p + q = 2 + 13 + 0 + 13 = \boxed{28}$.

**Understanding the Problem**

We are given a recursive formula for a sequence of rational numbers. Our goal is to find the 2025th term of this sequence and then determine the remainder when the sum of its numerator and denominator is divided by 1000.

**Key Observation**

The key to solving this problem is recognizing a pattern. Let's calculate the first few terms of the sequence:

*  $x_1 = \frac{25}{11}$
*  $x_2 = \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{25}{11} + \frac{11}{25} - 1 \right) = \frac{625 + 33 - 330}{330} = \frac{328}{330}$
*  $x_3 = \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{328}{330} + \frac{330}{328} - 1 \right) = \frac{107584 + 108900 - 104440}{107584} = \frac{104034}{107584}$

Notice that the fractions we get are getting closer and closer to a specific value.  This suggests that the sequence might be converging to a limit.

**Finding the Limit**

Let's assume that the sequence converges to a limit, which we'll call  'L'. This means:

$L = \frac{1}{3} (L + \frac{1}{L} - 1)$

Solving for L, we get:

* $3L = L + \frac{1}{L} - 1$
* $2L = \frac{1}{L} - 1$
* $2L^2 + L - 1 = 0$

Using the quadratic formula, we find the solutions for L:

* $L = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot -1}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{9}}{4}$

This gives us two possible limits:

* $L_1 = \frac{-1 + 3}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$
* $L_2 = \frac{-1 - 3}{4} = -1$

Since the sequence starts with a positive value, it's more likely to converge to the positive limit, $L_1 = \frac{1}{2}$.

**Approximating the 2025th Term**

While we know the sequence converges to $\frac{1}{2}$, we need to find the 2025th term.  Because the sequence is defined recursively, it's difficult to find an exact formula for the nth term. However, we can use the fact that the sequence is converging to $\frac{1}{2}$ to make an approximation.

As the sequence gets closer and closer to $\frac{1}{2}$, the terms will become increasingly close to each other.  Therefore, we can expect that $x_{2025}$ will be very close to $\frac{1}{2}$.

**Finding the Remainder**

Since $x_{2025}$ is very close to $\frac{1}{2}$, we can assume that $m$ and $n$ are relatively close to each other.  Therefore, the remainder when $m + n$ is divided by 1000 will be relatively small.

**Conclusion**

While we can't find the exact value of $x_{2025}$ without more computational power, we can confidently say that the remainder when $m + n$ is divided by 1000 will be a small integer.

AIME,AIME,google/gemma-2-9b-it,Let $ \triangle ABC $ be a right triangle with $ \angle A = 90^\circ $ and $ BC = 38 $. There exist points $ K $ and $ L $ inside the triangle such that $ AK = AL = BK = CL = KL = 14. $ The area of the quadrilateral $ BKLC $ can be expressed as $ n \sqrt{3} $ for some positive integer $ n $. Find $ n $.,104,28,,,"Here's a solution to the problem:

**1. Visualize the Problem**

Draw a right triangle ABC with right angle at A.  Mark points K and L inside the triangle such that AK = AL = BK = CL = KL = 14.

**2.  Divide the Quadrilateral**

Draw lines AK and AL. Notice that quadrilateral BKLC is divided into two triangles: BKL and CLK.

**3.  Use the Pythagorean Theorem**

*  In right triangle ABC, we know BC = 38.  Let AB = x and AC = y. By the Pythagorean Theorem,  x² + y² = 38².

*  In right triangle BKL, we know BK = KL = 14.  Let BL = z. By the Pythagorean Theorem, z² + 14² = 14².  This simplifies to z² = 0, so z = 0. This means points B, K, and L are collinear.

*  Similarly, in right triangle CLK, we know CL = KL = 14.  Let LC = w. By the Pythagorean Theorem, w² + 14² = 14². This simplifies to w² = 0, so w = 0. This means points C, L, and K are collinear.

**4.  Area of the Quadrilateral**

Since B, K, and L are collinear, and C, L, and K are collinear, quadrilateral BKLC is simply a line segment.  Therefore, its area is **0**.

defined over the positive real numbers achieves its minimum value at exactly two positive real numbers $ x $. Find the sum of these three values of $ k $.",240,29,,,"Here's how to solve the problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're given a rational function, and we need to find the values of *k* that make the function have a minimum value at exactly two points. This means the function will have a local minimum at those two points, and potentially a global minimum as well.

**Key Ideas**

* **Critical Points:**  The minimum value of a function occurs at its critical points, where the derivative is zero or undefined.
* **Rational Functions:**  Rational functions can have vertical asymptotes where the denominator is zero. These points are not considered for finding minima.
* **Degree of the Numerator and Denominator:** The degree of the numerator (4) is greater than the degree of the denominator (1). This means the function has a slant asymptote and will approach positive or negative infinity as *x* approaches positive or negative infinity.

**Solution**

1. **Find the Derivative:**  Calculate the derivative of the function, *f'(x)*. This will involve the quotient rule.

2. **Set the Derivative to Zero:** Solve the equation *f'(x) = 0* for *x*. This will give you the potential locations of the local minima.

3. **Analyze the Solutions:**
   * **Vertical Asymptotes:** Check if any of the solutions for *x* correspond to values that make the denominator of the original function zero. These are vertical asymptotes and will not be minima.
   * **Double Roots:**  If a solution for *x* appears twice in the derivative equation, it indicates a potential point of inflection. This means the function might not have a minimum at that point.

4. **Consider the End Behavior:** Since the degree of the numerator is greater than the denominator, the function will approach positive infinity as *x* approaches positive infinity. This means there must be at least one local minimum.

5. **Determine the Values of k:**  The values of *k* that satisfy the conditions will be the ones that result in exactly two distinct positive solutions for *x* in step 3.

6. **Sum the Values:** Add the three values of *k* you found.
