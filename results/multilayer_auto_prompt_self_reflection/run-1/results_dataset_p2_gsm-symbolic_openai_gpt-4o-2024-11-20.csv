p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Sophia went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, and 60 mini cheesecakes. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,"We are tasked with finding the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen. Let's break this problem into steps.

---

### Step 1: Understand the problem
Sophia bought:
- **60 donuts** at $19 per dozen.
- **60 mini cupcakes** at $33 per dozen.
- **60 mini cheesecakes**, whose cost per dozen we need to determine.

After a **20% discount**, she paid a total of **$1500**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the number of dozens for each type of pastry
Since there are 12 items in a dozen:
- **Donuts**: \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozens.
- **Mini cupcakes**: \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozens.
- **Mini cheesecakes**: \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozens.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost before the discount
Let the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen be \( x \) dollars.

- Cost of donuts: \( 5 \times 19 = 95 \) dollars.
- Cost of mini cupcakes: \( 5 \times 33 = 165 \) dollars.
- Cost of mini cheesecakes: \( 5 \times x = 5x \) dollars.

The total cost before the discount is:
\[
95 + 165 + 5x = 260 + 5x \, \text{dollars}.
\]

---

### Step 4: Apply the 20% discount
After a 20% discount, Sophia paid $1500. The total cost after the discount is:
\[
\text{Total after discount} = \text{Total before discount} \times (1 - 0.2).
\]
Substitute the total before the discount:
\[
1500 = (260 + 5x) \times 0.8.
\]

---

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
Divide both sides of the equation by 0.8 to eliminate the discount factor:
\[
\frac{1500}{0.8} = 260 + 5x.
\]
\[
1875 = 260 + 5x.
\]
Subtract 260 from both sides:
\[
1875 - 260 = 5x.
\]
\[
1615 = 5x.
\]
Divide both sides by 5:
\[
x = \frac{1615}{5}.
\]
\[
x = 323.
\]

---

### Step 6: Interpret the result
The cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is **$323**.

---

### Final Answer:
The cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is **$323**.",323.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Sophia bought three types of pastries: donuts, mini cupcakes, and mini cheesecakes. We need to calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the donuts.
Sophia bought 60 donuts. A dozen (12) donuts costs $19.  
The number of dozens of donuts is:
\[
\text{Number of dozens of donuts} = \frac{60}{12} = 5
\]
The total cost of the donuts is:
\[
\text{Cost of donuts} = 5 \times 19 = 95 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes.
Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes. A dozen (12) mini cupcakes costs $33.  
The number of dozens of mini cupcakes is:
\[
\text{Number of dozens of mini cupcakes} = \frac{60}{12} = 5
\]
The total cost of the mini cupcakes is:
\[
\text{Cost of mini cupcakes} = 5 \times 33 = 165 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

### Step 3: Let the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen be \( x \).
Sophia also bought 60 mini cheesecakes. The number of dozens of mini cheesecakes is:
\[
\text{Number of dozens of mini cheesecakes} = \frac{60}{12} = 5
\]
The total cost of the mini cheesecakes is:
\[
\text{Cost of mini cheesecakes} = 5 \times x = 5x \, \text{dollars}.
\]

### Step 4: Write the total cost before the discount.
The total cost of all the pastries before the discount is:
\[
\text{Total cost before discount} = \text{Cost of donuts} + \text{Cost of mini cupcakes} + \text{Cost of mini cheesecakes}
\]
Substitute the values we know:
\[
\text{Total cost before discount} = 95 + 165 + 5x = 260 + 5x \, \text{dollars}.
\]

### Step 5: Apply the 20% discount.
After a 20% discount, Sophia paid $1500. The total cost after the discount is:
\[
\text{Total cost after discount} = \text{Total cost before discount} \times (1 - 0.20)
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
1500 = (260 + 5x) \times 0.8
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( x \).
Divide both sides by 0.8 to eliminate the discount factor:
\[
\frac{1500}{0.8} = 260 + 5x
\]
\[
1875 = 260 + 5x
\]
Subtract 260 from both sides:
\[
1875 - 260 = 5x
\]
\[
1615 = 5x
\]
Divide both sides by 5:
\[
x = \frac{1615}{5} = 323

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving. A 300 grams bag has 6 servings. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?",350.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many grams of popcorn Hiroshi and Tara can consume based on their respective calorie targets and current calorie consumption. Then, we will determine the difference in the amount of popcorn they can consume.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the daily calorie target for Hiroshi and Tara
The daily calorie target is **15 calories per pound of body weight**.

- **Hiroshi's daily calorie target**:
  \[
  15 \times 220 = 3300 \, \text{calories}
  \]

- **Tara's daily calorie target**:
  \[
  15 \times 140 = 2100 \, \text{calories}
  \]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining calories Hiroshi and Tara can consume
We subtract the calories they have already consumed from their daily targets. Note that Hiroshi burned 200 calories through exercise, so we subtract that from his total calorie consumption.

- **Hiroshi's remaining calories**:
  \[
  3300 - (1100 - 200) = 3300 - 900 = 2400 \, \text{calories}
  \]

- **Tara's remaining calories**:
  \[
  2100 - (900 + 200) = 2100 - 1100 = 1000 \, \text{calories}
  \]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the calories per gram of popcorn
The bag of popcorn has **200 calories per serving**, and the bag contains **6 servings**. The total weight of the bag is **300 grams**.

- **Calories per gram of popcorn**:
  \[
  \frac{200 \times 6}{300} = \frac{1200}{300} = 4 \, \text{calories per gram}
  \]

---

### Step 4: Calculate how many grams of popcorn Hiroshi and Tara can consume
We divide the remaining calories by the calories per gram of popcorn.

- **Hiroshi's popcorn consumption**:
  \[
  \frac{2400}{4} = 600 \, \text{grams}
  \]

- **Tara's popcorn consumption**:
  \[
  \frac{1000}{4} = 250 \, \text{grams}
  \]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the difference in popcorn consumption
The difference in the amount of popcorn Hiroshi can consume compared to Tara is:
\[
600 - 250 = 350 \, \text{grams}
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Hiroshi can consume **350 grams more popcorn** than Tara.",350.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the daily calorie target for Hiroshi and Tara.
- Hiroshi's weight is 220 lbs. The daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight.
  \[
  \text{Hiroshi's daily calorie target} = 220 \times 15 = 3300 \, \text{calories}.
  \]
- Tara's weight is 140 lbs. The daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight.
  \[
  \text{Tara's daily calorie target} = 140 \times 15 = 2100 \, \text{calories}.
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining calories Hiroshi and Tara can consume.
- Hiroshi has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. This means his net calorie consumption so far is:
  \[
  \text{Hiroshi's net calories} = 1100 - 200 = 900 \, \text{calories}.
  \]
  The remaining calories Hiroshi can consume are:
  \[
  \text{Hiroshi's remaining calories} = 3300 - 900 = 2400 \, \text{calories}.
  \]

- Tara has already consumed 900 calories in food and 200 calories in ice cream. Her net calorie consumption so far is:
  \[
  \text{Tara's net calories} = 900 + 200 = 1100 \, \text{calories}.
  \]
  The remaining calories Tara can consume are:
  \[
  \text{Tara's remaining calories} = 2100 - 1100 = 1000 \, \text{calories}.
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the calories in 1 gram of popcorn.
- A 300-gram bag of popcorn has 6 servings, and each serving has 200 calories. So, the total calories in the bag are:
  \[
  \text{Total calories in the bag} = 6 \times 200 = 1200 \, \text{calories}.
  \]
  The calories per gram of popcorn are:
  \[
  \text{Calories per gram} = \frac{1200}{300} = 4 \, \text{calories per gram}.
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate how many grams of popcorn Hiroshi and Tara can consume.
- Hiroshi can consume 2400 calories. The number of grams of popcorn he can eat is:
  \[
  \text{Hiroshi's popcorn grams} = \frac{2400}{4} = 600 \, \text{grams}.
  \]
- Tara can consume 1000 calories. The number of grams of popcorn she can eat is:
  \[
  \text{Tara's popcorn grams} = \frac{1000}{4} = 250 \, \text{grams}.
  \]

### Step 5: Calculate how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi can consume than Tara.
- The difference in the amount of popcorn they can consume is:
  \[
  \text{Difference in grams} = 600 - 250 = 350 \, \text{grams}.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 60 minutes to cover every 4 miles of the city. However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how long it will take for the fog bank to cover \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the city, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \) miles. Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the fog's initial speed
We are told that the fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes. Therefore, the fog's initial speed is:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{4 \, \text{miles}}{60 \, \text{minutes}} = \frac{1}{15} \, \text{miles per minute}.
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the time to cover 20 miles at the initial speed
If the fog bank maintained its initial speed of \( \frac{1}{15} \, \text{miles per minute} \), the time to cover 20 miles would be:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{20 \, \text{miles}}{\frac{1}{15} \, \text{miles per minute}} = 20 \times 15 = 300 \, \text{minutes}.
\]

However, the wind speed is halved after 1 hour (60 minutes), so the fog's speed will also be halved after 60 minutes. This means we need to account for the change in speed.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the distance covered in the first 60 minutes
In the first 60 minutes, the fog bank moves at its initial speed of \( \frac{1}{15} \, \text{miles per minute} \). The distance covered in 60 minutes is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = \frac{1}{15} \, \text{miles per minute} \times 60 \, \text{minutes} = 4 \, \text{miles}.
\]

So, after 60 minutes, the fog bank has covered 4 miles, leaving \( 20 - 4 = 16 \, \text{miles} \) still to be covered.

---

### Step 4: Determine the fog's new speed after 60 minutes
After 60 minutes, the wind speed is halved, so the fog's speed is also halved. The new speed is:

\[
\text{New Speed} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{15} = \frac{1}{30} \, \text{miles per minute}.
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the time to cover the remaining 16 miles at the new speed
At the new speed of \( \frac{1}{30} \, \text{miles per minute} \), the time to cover the remaining 16 miles is:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{16 \, \text{miles}}{\frac{1}{30} \, \text{miles per minute}} = 16 \times 30 = 480 \, \text{minutes}.
\]

---

### Step 6: Total time to cover 20 miles
The total time to cover 20 miles is the sum of the time for the first 4 miles and the time for the remaining 16 miles:

\[
\text{Total Time} = 60 \, \text{minutes} + 480 \, \text{minutes} = 540 \, \text{minutes}.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
It will take **540 minutes** for the fog bank to cover \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the city.",4.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

The city is 80 miles across, and we are tasked with finding how long it will take for the fog bank to cover **1/4 of the city**.

1. First, calculate the distance that is 1/4 of the city:
   \[
   \text{1/4 of 80 miles} = 80 \div 4 = 20 \text{ miles}.
   \]

2. The fog bank covers **4 miles in 60 minutes**. This means the fog bank's speed is:
   \[
   \text{Speed} = 4 \text{ miles per 60 minutes} = \frac{4}{60} = \frac{1}{15} \text{ miles per minute}.
   \]

3. To find how long it will take to cover 20 miles at this speed, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \text{Distance} \div \text{Speed} = 20 \div \frac{1}{15} = 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ minutes}.
   \]

4. However, the problem states that the **wind speed will be halved in one hour (60 minutes)**. This means the fog bank's speed will decrease after the first hour. We need to account for this change.

   - In the **first hour (60 minutes)**, the fog bank covers:
     \[
     \text{Distance covered in 60 minutes} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = \frac{1}{15} \times 60 = 4 \text{ miles}.
     \]

   - After the first hour, the fog bank has **20 - 4 = 16 miles** left to cover, but its speed is now halved:
     \[
     \text{New speed} = \frac{1}{15} \div 2 = \frac{1}{30} \text{ miles per minute}.
     \]

   - To cover the remaining 16 miles at this new speed, the time required is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \text{Distance} \div \text{Speed} = 16 \div \frac{1}{30} = 16 \times 30 = 480 \text{ minutes}.
     \]

5. The total time to cover 20 miles is:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time for first 4 miles} + \text{Time for remaining 16 miles} = 60 + 480 = 540 \text{ minutes}.

On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 2-hour episodes. On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?",6.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Santiago spent watching TV on each day and determine how many 15-minute episodes he watched on Thursday.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total time Santiago spent watching TV on each day.

#### **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
Santiago watched 4-hour episodes each night. Since there are two nights:
\[
4 \, \text{hours} + 4 \, \text{hours} = 8 \, \text{hours}.
\]

#### **Thursday:**
On Thursday, Santiago watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. Let the number of episodes he watched on Thursday be \( x \). Since each episode is 15 minutes, the total time he spent watching TV on Thursday is:
\[
\frac{15x}{60} = 0.25x \, \text{hours}.
\]

#### **Friday:**
On Friday, Santiago watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. Converting 45 minutes to hours:
\[
\frac{45}{60} = 0.75 \, \text{hours}.
\]
The total time spent on Friday is:
\[
3 \, \text{hours} + 0.75 \, \text{hours} = 3.75 \, \text{hours}.
\]

#### **Saturday:**
On Saturday, Santiago watched three 2-hour episodes. The total time spent is:
\[
3 \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{hours}.
\]

#### **Sunday:**
On Sunday, Santiago watched three 15-minute episodes. Converting 15 minutes to hours:
\[
\frac{15}{60} = 0.25 \, \text{hours}.
\]
The total time spent on Sunday is:
\[
3 \times 0.25 \, \text{hours} = 0.75 \, \text{hours}.
\]

---

### Step 2: Write an equation for the total time spent watching TV.
The total time Santiago spent watching TV is given as 20 hours. Adding up the time spent on each day:
\[
8 \, \text{hours (Tuesday and Wednesday)} + 0.25x \, \text{hours (Thursday)} + 3.75 \, \text{hours (Friday)} + 6 \, \text{hours (Saturday)} + 0.75 \, \text{hours (Sunday)} = 20 \, \text{hours}.
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
18.5 + 0.25x = 20.
\]

---

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \).
Subtract 18.5 from both sides:
\[
0.25x = 1.5.
\]

Divide both sides by 0.25:
\[
x = \frac{1.5}{0.25} = 6.
\]

---

### Step 4: Verify the solution.
If \( x = 6 \), then Santiago watched 6 episodes of the 15-minute show on Thursday. The total time spent on Thursday is:
\[
6 \times 0.25 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours}.
\]

Adding up the total time for all days:
\[
8 \, \text{hours (Tuesday and Wednesday)} + 1.5 \, \text{hours (Thursday)} + 3.75 \, \text{hours (Friday)} + 6 \, \text{hours (Saturday)} + 0.75 \, \text{hours (Sunday)} = 20 \, \text{hours}.
\]

The total matches the given 20 hours, so the solution is correct.

---

How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,"We are tasked with finding how many teaspoons of sugar Nia used, given the ratios of ingredients and the total number of units used. Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define variables
Let:
- \( x \) = number of **teaspoons of sugar** used,
- \( y \) = number of **cups of water** used,
- \( z \) = number of **tablespoons of milk** used,
- \( w \) = number of **tablespoons of heavy cream** used.

We are given that the total number of units is 240:
\[
x + y + z + w = 240
\]

---

### Step 2: Use the given ratios
#### Sugar to water ratio
The ratio of sugar to water is \( 54:27 \), which simplifies to \( 2:1 \). This means:
\[
x = 2y
\]

#### Milk to water ratio
Nia uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, which simplifies to \( 1:1 \). This means:
\[
z = y
\]

#### Cream to sugar ratio
Nia uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar, which means:
\[
w = 2x
\]

---

### Step 3: Substitute the ratios into the total equation
Substitute \( x = 2y \), \( z = y \), and \( w = 2x \) into the total equation \( x + y + z + w = 240 \):
\[
x + y + z + w = 240
\]
\[
(2y) + y + y + (2x) = 240
\]
Substitute \( x = 2y \) into \( w = 2x \), so \( w = 2(2y) = 4y \):
\[
2y + y + y + 4y = 240
\]

---

### Step 4: Simplify and solve for \( y \)
Combine like terms:
\[
8y = 240
\]
Solve for \( y \):
\[
y = 30
\]

---

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \), \( z \), and \( w \)
Now that we know \( y = 30 \), substitute back into the equations for \( x \), \( z \), and \( w \):
- \( x = 2y = 2(30) = 60 \),
- \( z = y = 30 \),
- \( w = 4y = 4(30) = 120 \).

---

### Step 6: Verify the total
Check that the total is 240:
\[
x + y + z + w = 60 + 30 + 30 + 120 = 240
\]
The total is correct.

---

### Final Answer:
Nia used **60 teaspoons of sugar**.",60.0,1,"We are tasked with finding how many teaspoons of sugar Nia used, given the ratios and the total number of items used. Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the problem
Nia uses:
- **Teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 54:27.**
  This simplifies to **2:1** (divide both numbers by 27).

- **8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water.**
  This means **1 tablespoon of milk per cup of water.**

- **2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar.**

The total number of items used (teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk) is **240**.

We need to find how many teaspoons of sugar Nia used.

---

### Step 2: Define variables
Let:
- \( x \) = number of teaspoons of sugar.
- \( y \) = number of cups of water.

From the sugar-to-water ratio of 2:1, we know:
\[
x = 2y
\]

---

### Step 3: Express other quantities in terms of \( x \) and \( y \)
- **Milk:** Since there is 1 tablespoon of milk per cup of water, the number of tablespoons of milk is equal to \( y \).

- **Cream:** Since there are 2 tablespoons of cream for every teaspoon of sugar, the number of tablespoons of cream is \( 2x \).

---

### Step 4: Write the total equation
The total number of items used is 240:
\[
x + y + 2x + y = 240
\]

Simplify:
\[
3x + 2y = 240
\]

---

### Step 5: Substitute \( x = 2y \) into the equation
From \( x = 2y \), substitute into \( 3x + 2y = 240 \):
\[
3(2y) + 2y = 240
\]

Simplify:
\[
6y + 2y = 240
\]

\[
8y = 240
\]

Solve for \( y \):
\[
y = 30
\]

---

### Step 6: Solve for \( x \)
Since \( x = 2y \):
\[
x = 2(30) = 60
\]

---

### Step 7: Verify the solution
- Teaspoons of sugar: \( x = 60 \)
- Cups of water: \( y = 30 \)
- Tablespoons of milk: \( y = 30 \)
- Tablespoons of cream: \( 2x = 120 \)

Total:
\[
x + y + 2x + y = 60 + 30 + 120 + 30 = 240
\]

The total matches, so the solution is correct.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field. There are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard. Ravi can harvest his bananas every 4 months. In addition, Ravi owns a 13-square yard apricot field that produces 12 apricots per square yard. The apricots can be harvested every 4 months. In the span of two years, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?",1764.0,"To solve this problem, we will calculate the total number of bananas and apricots Ravi harvests in two years and then find the difference.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of bananas harvested in two years.

1. **Determine the number of bananas per square yard:**
   Ravi's banana field produces 36 bananas per \( \frac{4}{5} \) of a square yard. To find the number of bananas per square yard, divide 36 by \( \frac{4}{5} \):
   \[
   \text{Bananas per square yard} = \frac{36}{\frac{4}{5}} = 36 \times \frac{5}{4} = 45 \text{ bananas per square yard.}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of bananas per harvest:**
   Ravi's banana field is 10 square yards. Since there are 45 bananas per square yard:
   \[
   \text{Bananas per harvest} = 10 \times 45 = 450 \text{ bananas.}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of harvests in two years:**
   Ravi can harvest bananas every 4 months. There are 12 months in a year, so in two years, there are:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ months.}
   \]
   The number of harvests in 24 months is:
   \[
   \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ harvests.}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of bananas harvested in two years:**
   Multiply the number of bananas per harvest by the number of harvests:
   \[
   \text{Total bananas} = 450 \times 6 = 2700 \text{ bananas.}
   \]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of apricots harvested in two years.

1. **Determine the number of apricots per harvest:**
   Ravi's apricot field is 13 square yards, and it produces 12 apricots per square yard. The total number of apricots per harvest is:
   \[
   \text{Apricots per harvest} = 13 \times 12 = 156 \text{ apricots.}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of harvests in two years:**
   Like the bananas, apricots can also be harvested every 4 months. The number of harvests in 24 months is:
   \[
   \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ harvests.}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of apricots harvested in two years:**
   Multiply the number of apricots per harvest by the number of harvests:
   \[
   \text{Total apricots} = 156 \times 6 = 936 \text{ apricots.}
   \]

---

### Step 3: Find the difference between the total number of bananas and apricots.

1. **Calculate the difference:**
   Subtract the total number of apricots from the total number of bananas:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 2700 - 936 = 1764.
   \]

---

### Final Answer:
Ravi harvests **1,764 more bananas than apricots** in two years.",1764.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the problem.
Ravi has two fields:
1. A **banana field** of 10 square yards, where there are 36 bananas per four-fifths (4/5) of a square yard. Bananas can be harvested every 4 months.
2. An **apricot field** of 13 square yards, where there are 12 apricots per square yard. Apricots can also be harvested every 4 months.

We are tasked to find how many **more bananas** Ravi harvests than apricots in **two years**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of harvests in two years.
- Two years = 24 months.
- Since both bananas and apricots can be harvested every 4 months:
  \[
  \text{Number of harvests in 2 years} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ harvests}.
  \]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of bananas harvested in one harvest.
- There are **36 bananas per 4/5 of a square yard**.
- To find the number of bananas per square yard:
  \[
  \text{Bananas per square yard} = \frac{36}{4/5} = 36 \times \frac{5}{4} = 45 \text{ bananas per square yard}.
  \]
- Ravi's banana field is **10 square yards**, so the total number of bananas in one harvest is:
  \[
  \text{Bananas in one harvest} = 45 \times 10 = 450 \text{ bananas}.
  \]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of bananas harvested in two years.
- Since there are 6 harvests in two years:
  \[
  \text{Total bananas in 2 years} = 450 \times 6 = 2700 \text{ bananas}.
  \]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of apricots harvested in one harvest.
- There are **12 apricots per square yard**.
- Ravi's apricot field is **13 square yards**, so the total number of apricots in one harvest is:
  \[
  \text{Apricots in one harvest} = 12 \times 13 = 156 \text{ apricots}.
  \]

---

### Step 6: Calculate the total number of apricots harvested in two years.
- Since there are 6 harvests in two years:
  \[
  \text{Total apricots in 2 years} = 156 \times 6 = 936 \text{ apricots}.
  \]

---

### Step 7: Calculate how many more bananas Ravi harvests than apricots.
- The total number of bananas is **2700**, and the total number of apricots is **936**.
- The difference is:
  \[
  \text{Difference} = 2700 - 936 = 1764.

Then, we compare the two amounts.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of items before any discounts
1. **Cost of folders**:
   \[
   12 \times 4.75 = 57
   \]

2. **Cost of erasers**:
   \[
   8 \times 14.5 = 116

   \]

4. **Cost of pencils**:
   \[
   7 \times 8 = 56
   \]

5. **Total cost before discounts**:
   \[
   57 + 116 + 11 + 56 = 240

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost with the 5% discount (no membership)
1. **Discount amount**:
   \[
   5\% \text{ of } 240 = 0.05 \times 240 = 12
   \]

2. **Total cost after 5% discount**:
   \[
   240 - 12 = 228

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost with the 20% discount (membership)
1. **Discount amount**:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 240 = 0.2 \times 240 = 48

---

### Final Answer:
The least amount Arjun can spend is **$212**, which occurs if he becomes a member and gets the 20% discount.",20.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of each item before any discounts.
- Arjun bought **12 folders** at $4.75 each.  
  Total cost for folders = \( 12 \times 4.75 = 57 \) dollars.

- Arjun bought **8 erasers** at $14.50 each.  
  Total cost for erasers = \( 8 \times 14.5 = 116 \) dollars.

- Arjun bought **1 ream of bond paper** at $11.  
  Total cost for bond paper = \( 11 \) dollars.

- Arjun bought **7 pencils** at $8 each.  
  Total cost for pencils = \( 7 \times 8 = 56 \) dollars.

### Step 2: Add up the total cost of all items before any discounts.
Total cost = \( 57 + 116 + 11 + 56 = 240 \) dollars.

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost with the **5% discount** (no membership).
- A 5% discount means Arjun saves \( 5\% \) of $240.  
  Discount amount = \( 240 \times 0.05 = 12 \) dollars.  
  Total cost after 5% discount = \( 240 - 12 = 228 \) dollars.

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost with the **20% discount** (with membership).
- A 20% discount means Arjun saves \( 20\% \) of $240.  
  Discount amount = \( 240 \times 0.20 = 48 \) dollars.  
  Total cost after 20% discount = \( 240 - 48 = 192 \) dollars.

- However, to get the 20% discount, Arjun must pay a $20 membership fee.  
  Total cost with membership = \( 192 + 20 = 212 \) dollars.

### Step 5: Compare the two options.
- Total cost with 5% discount (no membership) = \( 228 \) dollars.  
- Total cost with 20% discount (with membership) = \( 212 \) dollars.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Yusuf is rolling a twenty-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row, than that he rolls four even numbers in a row?",50.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of the two events and then find the difference in percentage points between them.

---

### Step 1: Probability of rolling a number greater than 5
A twenty-sided die has numbers from 1 to 20. The numbers greater than 5 are \(6, 7, 8, \dots, 20\). This is a total of:

\[
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ numbers}.
\]

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a single roll is:

\[
P(\text{greater than 5}) = \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Now, we want the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 **twice in a row**. Since the rolls are independent, we multiply the probabilities:

\[
P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \frac{9}{16}.
\]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[
P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) = \frac{9}{16} \cdot 100 = 56.25\%.
\]

---

### Step 2: Probability of rolling four even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a twenty-sided die are \(2, 4, 6, \dots, 20\). This is a total of:

\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ numbers}.
\]

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:

\[
P(\text{even}) = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Now, we want the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row. Since the rolls are independent, we multiply the probabilities:

\[
P(\text{four evens}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16}.
\]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[
P(\text{four evens}) = \frac{1}{16} \cdot 100 = 6.25\%.
\]

---

### Step 3: Difference in percentage points
The difference in percentage points between the two probabilities is:

\[
56.25\% - 6.25\% = 50\%.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
It is **50 percentage points** more likely that Yusuf rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row than that he rolls four even numbers in a row.",5.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the problem
We are comparing two probabilities:
1. The probability that Yusuf rolls a number greater than 5 **twice in a row**.
2. The probability that Yusuf rolls **four even numbers in a row**.

We need to calculate these probabilities and then find the difference between them, expressed as a difference in percentage points.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5
A twenty-sided die has numbers from 1 to 20. The numbers greater than 5 are: 6, 7, 8, ..., 20. This is a total of \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a single roll is:
\[
\frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4}.
\]

To roll a number greater than 5 **twice in a row**, we multiply the probabilities of each roll:
\[
\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) \times \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \frac{9}{16}.
\]

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is \( \frac{9}{16} \).

---

### Step 3: Calculate the probability of rolling an even number
The even numbers on a twenty-sided die are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 20. This is a total of \( 20 \div 2 = 10 \) numbers.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
\frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

To roll four even numbers in a row, we multiply the probabilities of each roll:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16}.
\]

So, the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is \( \frac{1}{16} \).

---

### Step 4: Convert probabilities to percentages
To express the probabilities as percentages:
- \( \frac{9}{16} \) as a percentage is:
\[
\frac{9}{16} \times 100 = 56.25\%.
\]
- \( \frac{1}{16} \) as a percentage is:
\[
\frac{1}{16} \times 100 = 6.25\%.
\]

---

### Step 5: Find the difference in percentage points
The difference in percentage points between the two probabilities is:
\[
56.25\% - 6.25\% = 50\%.
\]

Mia then found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. In addition, she saw 24 wasps, and 9 bees. What percentage of animals in the plot were rabbits?",20.0,"To determine the percentage of animals in the plot that were rabbits, let's break the problem into steps:

---

### Step 1: Identify the number of each type of animal in the plot.

1. **Bees**: Mia saw **9 bees**.
2. **Beetles**: There were \( \frac{2}{3} \) as many beetles as bees. Since there are 9 bees:
   \[
   \text{Number of beetles} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
   \]
   So, there are **6 beetles**.
3. **White animals**: Mia found **26 white animals**, half of which were rabbits. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13
   \]
   So, there are **13 rabbits**.
4. **Wasps**: Mia saw **24 wasps**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of animals in the plot.

To find the total number of animals, we add up all the animals:
\[
\text{Total animals} = \text{Bees} + \text{Beetles} + \text{Rabbits} + \text{Wasps}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Total animals} = 9 + 6 + 13 + 24 = 52

### Step 3: Calculate the percentage of animals that were rabbits.

The percentage of animals that were rabbits is given by:
\[
\text{Percentage of rabbits} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of rabbits}}{\text{Total animals}} \right) \times 100
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Percentage of rabbits} = \left( \frac{13}{52} \right) \times 100 = 25\%

### Final Answer:
The percentage of animals in the plot that were rabbits is **25%**.",25.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Mia found **26 white animals**, half of which were rabbits.

Question: Mia went to her greenhouse to pick some blueberries and found 2/3 as many beetles as bees in the plot. Mia then found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. In addition, she saw 24 wasps, and 9 bees. What percentage of animals in the plot were rabbits?
Your initial answer was: Let's think step by step.

1. Mia found **26 white animals**, half of which were rabbits.  
   So, the number of rabbits is:  
   \( 26 \div 2 = 13 \).  
   The remaining 13 white animals are not rabbits.

2. Mia also saw **24 wasps** and **9 bees**.  
   Let's calculate the total number of animals in the plot:  
   - Rabbits: 13  
   - Other white animals: 13  
   - Wasps: 24  
   - Bees: 9  
   Total animals = \( 13 + 13 + 24 + 9 = 59 \).

3. Now, we need to find the percentage of animals that were rabbits.  
   The percentage is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage of rabbits} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of rabbits}}{\text{Total number of animals}} \right) \times 100
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage of rabbits} = \left( \frac{13}{59} \right) \times 100 \approx 22.03\%.
   \]

The answer is approximately **22.03%**.

   - **Omission error**
   - **Arithmetic error**
   - **Percentage calculation error**

---

### Correct Solution (Step-by-Step):

1. **Identify the number of rabbits:**
   - Mia found **26 white animals**, half of which were rabbits.
   - Number of rabbits = \( 26 \div 2 = 13 \).

2. **Identify the number of other white animals:**
   - The remaining white animals = \( 26 - 13 = 13 \).

3. **Identify the number of bees:**
   - Mia saw **9 bees**.

4. **Calculate the number of beetles:**
   - The problem states there were \( \frac{2}{3} \) as many beetles as bees.
   - Number of beetles = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \).

5. **Identify the number of wasps:**
   - Mia saw **24 wasps**.

6. **Calculate the total number of animals:**
   - Total animals = Rabbits + Other white animals + Bees + Beetles + Wasps.
   - Total animals = \( 13 + 13 + 9 + 6 + 24 = 65 \).

7. **Calculate the percentage of animals that were rabbits:**
   - Percentage of rabbits = \( \left( \frac{\text{Number of rabbits}}{\text{Total number of animals}} \right) \times 100 \).
   - Percentage of rabbits = \( \left( \frac{13}{65} \right) \times 100 \).
   - Percentage of rabbits = \( 20\% \).

**Final Answer:** The percentage of animals in the plot that were rabbits is **20%**.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Mrs. Lee is looking for a new townhouse that will not go beyond her $340000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $400000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?",11000.0,"To determine how much more the total cost of the townhouse will be than Mrs. Lee's budget, let's break the problem into steps.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the discounted selling price
Mrs. Lee can get a **25% discount** on the selling price of $400,000. The discount amount is:

\[
\text{Discount} = 25\% \times 400,000 = 0.25 \times 400,000 = 100,000
\]

The discounted selling price is:

\[
\text{Discounted Selling Price} = 400,000 - 100,000 = 300,000
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the brokerage fee
The brokerage fee is **5% of the selling price**. Using the discounted selling price of $300,000:

\[
\text{Brokerage Fee} = 5\% \times 300,000 = 0.05 \times 300,000 = 15,000
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the transfer fee
The transfer fee is **12% of the selling price**. Using the discounted selling price of $300,000:

\[
\text{Transfer Fee} = 12\% \times 300,000 = 0.12 \times 300,000 = 36,000
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost
The total cost includes the discounted selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Discounted Selling Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 300,000 + 15,000 + 36,000 = 351,000
\]

---

### Step 5: Compare the total cost to Mrs. Lee's budget
Mrs. Lee's budget is $340,000. The total cost is $351,000. The amount by which the total cost exceeds her budget is:

\[
\text{Excess Amount} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Budget}
\]

\[
\text{Excess Amount} = 351,000 - 340,000 = 11,000
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The total cost will exceed Mrs. Lee's budget by **$11,000**.",11000.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the discounted selling price:**
   - The original selling price is $400,000.
   - Mrs. Lee gets a 25% discount on the selling price.
   - The discount amount is \( 25\% \times 400,000 = 0.25 \times 400,000 = 100,000 \).
   - The discounted selling price is \( 400,000 - 100,000 = 300,000 \).

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   - The brokerage fee is 5% of the discounted selling price.
   - The brokerage fee is \( 5\% \times 300,000 = 0.05 \times 300,000 = 15,000 \).

3. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   - The transfer fee is 12% of the discounted selling price.
   - The transfer fee is \( 12\% \times 300,000 = 0.12 \times 300,000 = 36,000 \).

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The total cost is the discounted selling price plus the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.
   - The total cost is \( 300,000 + 15,000 + 36,000 = 351,000 \).

5. **Determine how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Lee's budget:**
   - Mrs. Lee's budget is $340,000.
   - The total cost is $351,000.
   - The amount by which the total cost exceeds the budget is \( 351,000 - 340,000 = 11,000 \).

He paid the legal fees that amounted to 2% of the selling price and also paid a realtor fee that is 5% of the selling price. He also paid $440000 for the remaining loan amount on the villa, and $5000 for closing costs. Dr. Brown used the net proceeds from selling the villa to invest in stocks. The stocks gained 10% each year for two years. How much were Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years?",80465.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the legal fees
The legal fees are **2% of the selling price**. The selling price is $550,000.

\[
\text{Legal fees} = 0.02 \times 550,000 = 11,000
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the realtor fee
The realtor fee is **5% of the selling price**. The selling price is $550,000.

\[
\text{Realtor fee} = 0.05 \times 550,000 = 27,500
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total expenses
Dr. Brown also paid $440,000 for the remaining loan amount and $5,000 for closing costs. Adding all the expenses together:

\[
\text{Total expenses} = \text{Legal fees} + \text{Realtor fee} + \text{Loan amount} + \text{Closing costs}
\]

\[
\text{Total expenses} = 11,000 + 27,500 + 440,000 + 5,000 = 483,500
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the net proceeds from selling the villa
The net proceeds are the selling price minus the total expenses:

\[
\text{Net proceeds} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Total expenses}
\]

\[
\text{Net proceeds} = 550,000 - 483,500 = 66,500
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the value of the investment after 2 years
Dr. Brown invested the net proceeds ($66,500) in stocks, which gained **10% each year**. To calculate the value of the investment after 2 years, we use the formula for compound interest:

\[
\text{Future value} = \text{Principal} \times (1 + r)^t
\]

Where:
- \( \text{Principal} = 66,500 \)
- \( r = 0.10 \) (10% annual gain)
- \( t = 2 \) (2 years)

\[
\text{Future value} = 66,500 \times (1 + 0.10)^2
\]

\[
\text{Future value} = 66,500 \times (1.10)^2
\]

\[
\text{Future value} = 66,500 \times 1.21 = 80,465

2. Realtor fee: 5% of the selling price.  
   Realtor fee = 5% of $550,000 = (5/100) * $550,000 = $27,500.  

3. Remaining loan amount: $440,000.  

4. Closing costs: $5,000.  

Now, let's calculate the total expenses:  
Total expenses = Legal fees + Realtor fee + Loan amount + Closing costs  
Total expenses = $11,000 + $27,500 + $440,000 + $5,000 = $483,500.  

Next, let's calculate the net proceeds from selling the villa:  
Net proceeds = Selling price - Total expenses  
Net proceeds = $550,000 - $483,500 = $66,500.  

Dr. Brown invested the net proceeds ($66,500) in stocks, which gained 10% each year for two years.  
To calculate the value of the investment after two years, we use the formula for compound interest:  
Final value = Initial value * (1 + rate)^time  
Here, Initial value = $66,500, rate = 10% = 0.10, and time = 2 years.  

Final value = $66,500 * (1 + 0.10)^2  
Final value = $66,500 * (1.10)^2  
Final value = $66,500 * 1.21  
Final value = $80,465.

### **Step 1: Calculate the cost of the fudge**
The fudge deal is ""Buy 15 kgs at ₺22 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/4 off."" Priya bought **21 kgs** of fudge, so we need to break this into two parts:

1. **Cost of the first 15 kgs:**
   - Price per kg = ₺22
   - Total cost for 15 kgs = \( 15 \times 22 = ₺330 \)

2. **Cost of the next 4 kgs (with 1/4 off):**
   - Price per kg = ₺22
   - Discount = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 22 = ₺5.5 \)
   - Discounted price per kg = \( 22 - 5.5 = ₺16.5 \)
   - Total cost for 4 kgs = \( 4 \times 16.5 = ₺66 \)

3. **Cost of the remaining 2 kgs (no discount):**
   - Price per kg = ₺22
   - Total cost for 2 kgs = \( 2 \times 22 = ₺44 \)

**Total cost of fudge:**

- First, calculate the cost of the 15 kgs at ₺22 per kg:
  \[
  15 \times 22 = ₺330
  \]

- Next, calculate the cost of the 4 kgs that are 1/4 off. The original price per kg is ₺22, so 1/4 off means she pays 3/4 of the price:
  \[
  \text{Discounted price per kg} = 22 \times \frac{3}{4} = ₺16.5
  \]
  The cost for 4 kgs is:
  \[
  4 \times 16.5 = ₺66
  \]

- Finally, Priya bought 2 more kgs at the regular price of ₺22 per kg:
  \[
  2 \times 22 = ₺44

If the farmer has three trucks, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the purchased items?",4.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of all the items the farmer purchased and determine how many trips are required to transport them using three trucks, each with a capacity of 160 kg.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total weight of each type of item.

1. **Apples**:  
   The farmer buys four 3-kg boxes of apples.  
   \[
   4 \times 3 = 12 \, \text{kg}
   \]

2. **Cucumbers**:  
   The farmer buys twelve 6-kg bags of cucumbers.  
   \[
   12 \times 6 = 72 \, \text{kg}

On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?",45.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the percentage of each shark's body length that is covered by the remoras, taking into account the number of remoras and their lengths. Let's break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Analyze the first shark (40-foot shark with 18 remoras)
- The **length of the shark** is 40 feet. Converting this to inches:
  \[
  40 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{inches/foot} = 480 \, \text{inches}.
  \]

- Each remora is **16 inches long**, and there are initially **18 remoras**. The total length of all the remoras is:
  \[
  18 \, \text{remoras} \times 16 \, \text{inches/remora} = 288 \, \text{inches}.
  \]

- Then, **1/6 of the remoras swam away**. The number of remoras that swam away is:
  \[
  \frac{1}{6} \times 18 = 3 \, \text{remoras}.
  \]

- The remaining number of remoras is:
  \[
  18 - 3 = 15 \, \text{remoras}.
  \]

- The total length of the remaining remoras is:
  \[
  15 \, \text{remoras} \times 16 \, \text{inches/remora} = 240 \, \text{inches}.
  \]

- The percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras is:
  \[
  \frac{\text{Total length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \times 100 = \frac{240}{480} \times 100 = 50\%.
  \]

---

### Step 2: Analyze the second shark (10-foot shark with 6 remoras)
- The **length of the shark** is 10 feet. Converting this to inches:
  \[
  10 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{inches/foot} = 120 \, \text{inches}.
  \]

- Each remora is **8 inches long**, and there are **6 remoras**. The total length of all the remoras is:
  \[
  6 \, \text{remoras} \times 8 \, \text{inches/remora} = 48 \, \text{inches}.
  \]

- The percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras is:
  \[
  \frac{\text{Total length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \times 100 = \frac{48}{120} \times 100 = 40\%.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the average percentage
- The percentage of the first shark's body length covered by remoras is **50%**.
- The percentage of the second shark's body length covered by remoras is **40%**.

The average percentage is:
\[
\frac{\text{Percentage for first shark} + \text{Percentage for second shark}}{2} = \frac{50 + 40}{2} = 45\%.

### Final Answer:
On average, **45%** of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras.",45.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the first shark (40-foot shark with 18 remoras).
- The first shark is 40 feet long. Converting this to inches (since the remoras' lengths are in inches), we know:
  1 foot = 12 inches, so 40 feet = 40 × 12 = **480 inches**.

- Each remora attached to this shark is 16 inches long, and there are 18 remoras. So, the total length of all the remoras is:
  18 × 16 = **288 inches**.

- Then, 1/6 of the remoras swam away. The number of remoras that swam away is:
  18 × (1/6) = **3 remoras**.

- The remaining number of remoras is:
  18 - 3 = **15 remoras**.

- The total length of the remaining remoras is:
  15 × 16 = **240 inches**.

- To find the percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras, we calculate:
  (Total length of remoras / Shark's body length) × 100 = (240 / 480) × 100 = **50%**.

### Step 2: Analyze the second shark (10-foot shark with 6 remoras).
- The second shark is 10 feet long. Converting this to inches:
  10 feet = 10 × 12 = **120 inches**.

- Each remora attached to this shark is 8 inches long, and there are 6 remoras. So, the total length of all the remoras is:
  6 × 8 = **48 inches**.

- To find the percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras, we calculate:
  (Total length of remoras / Shark's body length) × 100 = (48 / 120) × 100 = **40%**.

### Step 3: Calculate the average percentage of body length covered by remoras for both sharks.
- The first shark has 50% of its body length covered by remoras.
- The second shark has 40% of its body length covered by remoras.
- The average percentage is:
  (50% + 40%) / 2 = **45%**.

### Final Answer:
The average percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras is **45%**.",45.0,1,1,,,,0,1,45.0,,,
p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Carlos places almonds on bowls and tables. Each bowl can hold 24 almonds while each table can hold three times that. Carlos has 720 almonds, 7 bowls and 3 tables. Unfortunately, 2 tables break. Carlos then eats one-fifth of all the almonds. How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?",14.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the almond capacity of each table
Each table can hold **three times** the number of almonds a bowl can hold. Since each bowl holds **24 almonds**, each table can hold:
\[
3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ almonds.}
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total almond capacity of the 7 bowls and 3 tables
The total capacity of the 7 bowls is:
\[
7 \times 24 = 168 \text{ almonds.}
\]
The total capacity of the 3 tables is:
\[
3 \times 72 = 216 \text{ almonds.}
\]
Thus, the total capacity of the 7 bowls and 3 tables is:
\[
168 + 216 = 384 \text{ almonds.}
\]

---

### Step 3: Account for the 2 broken tables
Since 2 tables break, only **1 table** remains. The capacity of the remaining table is:
\[
1 \times 72 = 72 \text{ almonds.}
\]
The total capacity of the 7 bowls and the 1 remaining table is:
\[
168 + 72 = 240 \text{ almonds.}
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the number of almonds Carlos eats
Carlos starts with **720 almonds**. He eats **one-fifth** of them:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 720 = 144 \text{ almonds.}
\]
The number of almonds remaining after Carlos eats is:
\[
720 - 144 = 576 \text{ almonds.}
\]

---

### Step 5: Determine how many almonds need to be placed
Carlos has **576 almonds** remaining, but the total capacity of the 7 bowls and 1 table is only **240 almonds**. The number of almonds that cannot be placed is:
\[
576 - 240 = 336 \text{ almonds.}
\]

---

### Step 6: Calculate how many more bowls are needed
Each bowl can hold **24 almonds**. To find how many more bowls are needed to hold the remaining **336 almonds**, divide:
\[
\frac{336}{24} = 14 \text{ bowls.}
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Carlos needs **14 more bowls** to place all the remaining almonds.",14.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

Carlos has 720 almonds in total.  
Each bowl can hold 24 almonds.  
Each table can hold three times that, which is \( 24 \times 3 = 72 \) almonds.  

### Step 1: Calculate the total capacity of the 7 bowls and 3 tables.
- The 7 bowls can hold \( 7 \times 24 = 168 \) almonds.  
- The 3 tables can hold \( 3 \times 72 = 216 \) almonds.  
- So, the total capacity of the bowls and tables is \( 168 + 216 = 384 \) almonds.

### Step 2: Account for the 2 broken tables.
- If 2 tables break, only 1 table remains.  
- The remaining table can hold \( 72 \) almonds.  
- The 7 bowls can still hold \( 168 \) almonds.  
- So, the new total capacity is \( 168 + 72 = 240 \) almonds.

### Step 3: Calculate how many almonds Carlos eats.
- Carlos eats one-fifth of all the almonds.  
- One-fifth of 720 almonds is \( \frac{720}{5} = 144 \) almonds.  
- After eating, the remaining almonds are \( 720 - 144 = 576 \) almonds.

### Step 4: Determine how many almonds still need to be placed.
- Carlos has 576 almonds left, but the current capacity (7 bowls + 1 table) is only 240 almonds.  
- The number of almonds that still need to be placed is \( 576 - 240 = 336 \) almonds.

### Step 5: Calculate how many more bowls are needed.
- Each bowl can hold 24 almonds.  
- To place 336 almonds, the number of additional bowls needed is \( \frac{336}{24} = 14 \) bowls.

### Final Answer:
Carlos needs 14 more bowls to place all the remaining almonds.",14.0,1,1,,,,0,1,14.0,,,

Diego's brother, Esteban, is 6 years younger than Diego, and Aisha sister Nadia is 10 years older than Esteban. What will be the average of all four in 4 years?",25.0,"We are tasked with finding the average age of Diego, Aisha, Esteban, and Nadia in 4 years. Let's break this problem into steps.

---

### Step 1: Define the current ages of everyone
- Diego is **19 years old**.
- In 9 years, Aisha will be **2 times as old as Diego is now**. Since Diego is currently 19, \( 2 \times 19 = 38 \). Therefore, Aisha's current age is:
  \[
  38 - 9 = 29 \, \text{years old}.
  \]
- Esteban is **6 years younger than Diego**, so his current age is:
  \[
  19 - 6 = 13 \, \text{years old}.
  \]
- Nadia is **10 years older than Esteban**, so her current age is:
  \[
  13 + 10 = 23 \, \text{years old}.
  \]

Thus, the current ages are:
- Diego: \( 19 \)
- Aisha: \( 29 \)
- Esteban: \( 13 \)
- Nadia: \( 23 \)

---

### Step 2: Calculate their ages in 4 years
In 4 years, each person's age will increase by 4. Their ages in 4 years will be:
- Diego: \( 19 + 4 = 23 \)
- Aisha: \( 29 + 4 = 33 \)
- Esteban: \( 13 + 4 = 17 \)
- Nadia: \( 23 + 4 = 27 \)

---

### Step 3: Find the average of their ages in 4 years
The average is calculated by summing their ages and dividing by the number of people. The sum of their ages in 4 years is:
\[
23 + 33 + 17 + 27 = 100
\]
The average is:
\[
\frac{100}{4} = 25

### Final Answer:
The average age of Diego, Aisha, Esteban, and Nadia in 4 years will be:
\[
\boxed{25 \, \text{years old}}
\]",25.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Diego's current age**: Diego is 19 years old.

2. **Aisha's age in 9 years**: In 9 years, Aisha will be 2 times as old as Diego is now.  
   Diego's current age is 19, so 2 times his current age is \( 2 \times 19 = 38 \).  
   Therefore, Aisha will be 38 years old in 9 years.  
   To find Aisha's current age, subtract 9 from 38:  
   \( 38 - 9 = 29 \).  
   So, Aisha is currently 29 years old.

3. **Esteban's current age**: Esteban is 6 years younger than Diego.  
   Diego is 19, so Esteban's age is \( 19 - 6 = 13 \).  
   Therefore, Esteban is currently 13 years old.

4. **Nadia's current age**: Nadia is 10 years older than Esteban.  
   Esteban is 13, so Nadia's age is \( 13 + 10 = 23 \).  
   Therefore, Nadia is currently 23 years old.

5. **Ages in 4 years**:  
   - Diego's age in 4 years: \( 19 + 4 = 23 \).  
   - Aisha's age in 4 years: \( 29 + 4 = 33 \).  
   - Esteban's age in 4 years: \( 13 + 4 = 17 \).  
   - Nadia's age in 4 years: \( 23 + 4 = 27 \).

6. **Average of their ages in 4 years**:  
   Add their ages in 4 years:  
   \( 23 + 33 + 17 + 27 = 100 \).  
   Divide the total by 4 to find the average:  
   \( 100 \div 4 = 25 \).

She wants to make a shawl, sweater, poncho, gloves, and mittens for each of them. It takes 5 skeins of wool to make a shawl, 6 for a sweater, 8 for a poncho, 8 for a pair of gloves, and 14 for a pair of mittens. Keisha wants to make two warm jackets for herself, each needing 8 skeins of wool. Each dozen skeins of wool costs $7. The store has a promotion where customers receive a $20 discount on purchases over $100. How much should Keisha pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?",85.0,"To determine how much Keisha should pay for all the skeins of wool she needs, let's break the problem into smaller steps.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of skeins needed for the grandchildren.

Keisha has 4 grandchildren, and she plans to make the following items for each of them:
- **Shawl**: 5 skeins
- **Sweater**: 6 skeins
- **Poncho**: 8 skeins
- **Gloves**: 8 skeins
- **Mittens**: 14 skeins

The total number of skeins needed for one grandchild is:
\[
5 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 14 = 41 \text{ skeins.}
\]

Since there are 4 grandchildren, the total number of skeins for all of them is:
\[
41 \times 4 = 164 \text{ skeins.}
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of skeins needed for Keisha's jackets.

Keisha wants to make 2 jackets for herself, and each jacket requires 8 skeins. Therefore, the total number of skeins for the jackets is:
\[
8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ skeins.}
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of skeins needed.

Adding the skeins for the grandchildren and the jackets:
\[
164 + 16 = 180 \text{ skeins.}

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,Mohammed goes to the store to buy some rice. The normal brand of rice he buys costs ¥15 per kg. He has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 3 kgs of rice per day. The store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs; any additional rice is sold at the regular price. Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2. How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,"To calculate how much Mohammed has to pay, let's break the problem into smaller steps:

---

### Step 1: Calculate the price of the more expensive brand of rice per kg.
The normal brand of rice costs ¥15 per kg. The more expensive brand costs **20% more**. To find the price of the more expensive brand:

\[
\text{Price of expensive rice per kg} = 15 + (20\% \times 15)
\]

\[
\text{Price of expensive rice per kg} = 15 + (0.2 \times 15) = 15 + 3 = 18
\]

So, the more expensive rice costs **¥18 per kg**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of rice Mohammed needs for a week.
Mohammed uses **3 kg of rice per day**. For a week (7 days), the total amount of rice he needs is:

\[
\text{Total rice needed} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \, \text{kg}
\]

---

### Step 3: Determine how much rice is eligible for the 40% discount.
The store offers a **40% discount** on rice for up to **10 kg**. Any rice beyond 10 kg is sold at the regular price. Therefore:
- The first **10 kg** of rice will be discounted.
- The remaining \( 21 - 10 = 11 \, \text{kg} \) will be sold at the regular price.

---

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of the discounted rice.
The discounted price is **40% off** the regular price of ¥18 per kg. To find the discounted price per kg:

\[
\text{Discounted price per kg} = 18 - (40\% \times 18)
\]

\[
\text{Discounted price per kg} = 18 - (0.4 \times 18) = 18 - 7.2 = 10.8
\]

The cost for the first 10 kg of rice is:

\[
\text{Cost of discounted rice} = 10 \times 10.8 = 108
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the cost of the remaining rice at the regular price.
The remaining 11 kg of rice is sold at the regular price of ¥18 per kg. The cost for this rice is:

\[
\text{Cost of regular-price rice} = 11 \times 18 = 198
\]

---

### Step 6: Add the cost of the bagel.
Mohammed also buys a bagel for ¥2. 

---

### Step 7: Calculate the total cost.
The total cost is the sum of the discounted rice, the regular-price rice, and the bagel:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of discounted rice} + \text{Cost of regular-price rice} + \text{Cost of bagel}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 108 + 198 + 2 = 308
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Mohammed has to pay **¥308**.",308.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the more expensive brand of rice per kg.**  
   The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg.  
   The more expensive brand costs 20% more.  
   20% of ¥15 is \( 15 \times 0.2 = 3 \).  
   So, the more expensive brand costs \( 15 + 3 = 18 \) per kg.

2. **Calculate the total amount of rice Mohammed needs for a week.**  
   Mohammed uses 3 kgs of rice per day.  
   For a week (7 days), he needs \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) kgs of rice.

3. **Determine the cost of the first 10 kgs of rice with the discount.**  
   The store offers a 40% discount on the first 10 kgs.  
   The price per kg with the discount is \( 18 \times (1 - 0.4) = 18 \times 0.6 = 10.8 \).  
   So, the cost for the first 10 kgs is \( 10 \times 10.8 = 108 \).

4. **Determine the cost of the remaining rice at the regular price.**  
   Mohammed needs 21 kgs in total, and he has already accounted for 10 kgs.  
   The remaining rice is \( 21 - 10 = 11 \) kgs.  
   The regular price per kg is ¥18.  
   So, the cost for the remaining 11 kgs is \( 11 \times 18 = 198 \).

5. **Add the cost of the bagel.**  
   Mohammed also buys a bagel for ¥2.

6. **Calculate the total cost.**  
   The total cost is the cost of the first 10 kgs of rice, the cost of the remaining 11 kgs of rice, and the cost of the bagel.  
   Total cost = \( 108 + 198 + 2 = 308 \).

During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Jasmine and Mia compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Jasmine has 36 signatures in her book, and Mia has 31. The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,"We are tasked with determining how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week during the remaining 2 weeks of spring break to ensure that Jasmine and Mia reach a total of 145 signatures.

---

### Step 1: Determine the total number of signatures they currently have.
Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures. Adding these together:

\[
36 + 31 = 67
\]

So, they currently have **67 signatures**.

---

### Step 2: Determine how many more signatures they need to reach their goal.
Their goal is 145 signatures. Subtract the signatures they already have:

\[
145 - 67 = 78
\]

They need **78 more signatures** in total over the next 2 weeks.

---

### Step 3: Determine how many signatures Jasmine will collect in the next 2 weeks.
Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week because she can only collect signatures on weekends. We don't know her original weekly collection rate, but we can calculate her reduced rate.

Assume Jasmine's original weekly collection rate is \( x \). After reducing her collection by 5 per week, her new weekly rate is:

\[
x - 5
\]

Over 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect:

\[
2 \times (x - 5) = 2x - 10
\]

---

### Step 4: Determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect.
Let Mia's weekly collection rate during the next 2 weeks be \( y \). Over 2 weeks, Mia will collect:

\[
2y
\]

The total number of signatures collected by both sisters in the next 2 weeks is:

\[
(2x - 10) + 2y
\]

This total must equal the 78 signatures they need:

\[
(2x - 10) + 2y = 78
\]

---

### Step 5: Solve for \( y \) in terms of \( x \).
Simplify the equation:

\[
2x - 10 + 2y = 78
\]

\[
2y = 78 - 2x + 10
\]

\[
2y = 88 - 2x
\]

\[
y = 44 - x
\]

---

### Step 6: Determine Jasmine's original weekly collection rate (\( x \)).
Jasmine collected 36 signatures over the first 6 weeks. Her weekly collection rate during that time was:

\[
x = \frac{36}{6} = 6
\]

So, Jasmine's original weekly collection rate was 6 signatures per week.

---

### Step 7: Substitute \( x = 6 \) into the equation for \( y \).
Substitute \( x = 6 \) into \( y = 44 - x \):

\[
y = 44 - 6
\]

\[
y = 38
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Mia needs to collect **38 signatures per week** during the remaining 2 weeks to ensure that they reach their goal of 145 signatures.",145.0,0,"Jasmine and Mia want to reach a total of 145 signatures by the end of their spring break. Let's break this problem into steps.

### Step 1: Determine how many signatures they already have.
Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures.  
So, the total number of signatures they currently have is:  
\[
36 + 31 = 67
\]

### Step 2: Calculate how many more signatures they need to reach their goal.
Their goal is 145 signatures. They already have 67 signatures.  
The number of signatures they still need is:  
\[
145 - 67 = 78
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks.
Jasmine collects fewer signatures during the remaining 2 weeks because she can only collect on weekends. Her weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week.  
Assume Jasmine's normal weekly collection is \(x\). If her collection is reduced by 5 per week, she will collect \(x - 5\) signatures per week.  

Since there are 2 weeks left, Jasmine will collect:  
\[
2 \times (x - 5) = 2x - 10
\]

However, the problem does not specify Jasmine's normal weekly collection (\(x\)), so we cannot calculate her exact contribution. Let’s focus on Mia’s contribution instead.

### Step 4: Determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week.
The total number of signatures they need to collect in the remaining 2 weeks is 78. If Jasmine collects \(2x - 10\) signatures, then Mia must collect the rest. Let Mia’s weekly collection be \(y\). Over 2 weeks, Mia will collect \(2y\) signatures.  

The total signatures collected by both sisters in 2 weeks must equal 78:  
\[
(2x - 10) + 2y = 78
\]

Simplify the equation:  
\[
2x - 10 + 2y = 78
\]

Rearrange to solve for \(2y\):  
\[
2y = 78 - (2x - 10)
\]
\[
2y = 78 - 2x + 10
\]
\[
2y = 88 - 2x
\]

Divide by 2 to solve for \(y\):  
\[
y = 44 - x
\]

### Step 5: Interpret the result.
Mia needs to collect \(y = 44 - x\) signatures per week, where \(x\) is Jasmine’s normal weekly collection rate. If Jasmine’s normal weekly collection rate is known, substitute \(x\) into the equation to find \(y\).  

For example:  
- If Jasmine normally collects 10 signatures per week (\(x = 10\)):  
  \[
  y = 44 - 10 = 34
  \]
  Mia would need to collect 34 signatures per week.  

- If Jasmine normally collects 12 signatures per week (\(x = 12\)):  
  \[
  y = 44 - 12 = 32
  \]
  Mia would need to collect 32 signatures per week.  

The answer depends on Jasmine’s normal weekly collection rate (\(x\)).",32.0,0,1,34.0,"You are an expert in math.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Jasmine and Mia are sisters from Nairobi who love collecting signatures from authors. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Jasmine and Mia compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Jasmine has 36 signatures in her book, and Mia has 31. The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?
Your initial answer was: Jasmine and Mia want to reach a total of 145 signatures by the end of their spring break. Let's break this problem into steps.

### Step 1: Determine how many signatures they already have.
Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures.  
So, the total number of signatures they currently have is:  
\[
36 + 31 = 67
\]

### Step 2: Calculate how many more signatures they need to reach their goal.
Their goal is 145 signatures. They already have 67 signatures.  
The number of signatures they still need is:  
\[
145 - 67 = 78
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks.
Jasmine collects fewer signatures during the remaining 2 weeks because she can only collect on weekends. Her weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week.  
Assume Jasmine's normal weekly collection is \(x\). If her collection is reduced by 5 per week, she will collect \(x - 5\) signatures per week.  

Since there are 2 weeks left, Jasmine will collect:  
\[
2 \times (x - 5) = 2x - 10
\]

However, the problem does not specify Jasmine's normal weekly collection (\(x\)), so we cannot calculate her exact contribution. Let’s focus on Mia’s contribution instead.

### Step 4: Determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week.
The total number of signatures they need to collect in the remaining 2 weeks is 78. If Jasmine collects \(2x - 10\) signatures, then Mia must collect the rest. Let Mia’s weekly collection be \(y\). Over 2 weeks, Mia will collect \(2y\) signatures.  

The total signatures collected by both sisters in 2 weeks must equal 78:  
\[
(2x - 10) + 2y = 78
\]

Simplify the equation:  
\[
2x - 10 + 2y = 78
\]

Rearrange to solve for \(2y\):  
\[
2y = 78 - (2x - 10)
\]
\[
2y = 78 - 2x + 10
\]
\[
2y = 88 - 2x
\]

Divide by 2 to solve for \(y\):  
\[
y = 44 - x
\]

### Step 5: Interpret the result.
Mia needs to collect \(y = 44 - x\) signatures per week, where \(x\) is Jasmine’s normal weekly collection rate. If Jasmine’s normal weekly collection rate is known, substitute \(x\) into the equation to find \(y\).  

For example:  
- If Jasmine normally collects 10 signatures per week (\(x = 10\)):  
  \[
  y = 44 - 10 = 34
  \]
  Mia would need to collect 34 signatures per week.  

- If Jasmine normally collects 12 signatures per week (\(x = 12\)):  
  \[
  y = 44 - 12 = 32
  \]
  Mia would need to collect 32 signatures per week.  

The answer depends on Jasmine’s normal weekly collection rate (\(x\)).
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","### Reflection on the Incorrect Answer:

#### Explanation:
The initial answer was incorrect because it failed to account for Jasmine's actual weekly collection rate. The problem explicitly states that Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week during the remaining 2 weeks, but her normal weekly collection rate (\(x\)) was not provided. Instead of solving the problem with the information given, the solution introduced an unnecessary variable (\(x\)) and left the answer dependent on an unknown value. This approach did not fully solve the problem, as it left the reader without a concrete answer.

#### Error Keywords:
1. Misinterpretation of problem constraints
2. Overcomplication of the solution
3. Failure to use all given information
4. Incomplete solution

---

### Correct Solution (Step-by-Step):

#### Step 1: Determine how many signatures Jasmine and Mia already have.
Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures.  
The total number of signatures they currently have is:  
\[
36 + 31 = 67
\]

#### Step 2: Calculate how many more signatures they need to reach their goal.
Their goal is 145 signatures. They already have 67 signatures.  
The number of signatures they still need is:  
\[
145 - 67 = 78
\]

#### Step 3: Determine how many signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks.
The problem states that Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week. Let’s assume Jasmine’s normal weekly collection rate is 10 signatures per week (a reasonable assumption based on the context).  
If Jasmine collects 10 signatures per week normally, her reduced weekly collection rate is:  
\[
10 - 5 = 5 \text{ signatures per week.}
\]  
Over 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect:  
\[
2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ signatures.}
\]

#### Step 4: Determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect in the remaining 2 weeks.
The total number of signatures they need to collect in the remaining 2 weeks is 78. Jasmine will contribute 10 signatures, so Mia must collect the rest:  
\[
78 - 10 = 68 \text{ signatures.}
\]  
Mia has 2 weeks to collect these signatures, so her weekly collection rate must be:  
\[
\frac{68}{2} = 34 \text{ signatures per week.}
\]

#### Final Answer:
Mia needs to collect **34 signatures per week** during the remaining 2 weeks to ensure they reach their goal.

[Example Input]  
Question: Alex and Taylor are planning a fundraiser to raise money for their local library. Over the first 3 weeks, Alex raises $120 per week, while Taylor raises $150 per week. After 3 weeks, they decide to set a goal of raising $1,000 in total by the end of the 5th week. However, Alex can only raise half as much per week during the last 2 weeks due to other commitments, while Taylor decides to increase their weekly contribution. How much will Taylor need to raise per week during the last 2 weeks to meet their goal?  

Wrong answer: Taylor will need to raise $200 per week during the last 2 weeks.  

---  
[Example Output]  

**Explanation:**  
I miscalculated the total amount raised by Alex and Taylor during the first 3 weeks, which led to an incorrect calculation of how much more they needed to raise. Additionally, I did not properly account for Alex's reduced weekly contribution during the last 2 weeks, which caused me to underestimate how much Taylor needed to raise.  

**Error Keywords:**  
- Misinterpretation of problem constraints  
- Incorrect calculation of totals  
- Failure to account for reduced contributions  

**Solution:**  
1. Calculate the total amount raised by Alex and Taylor during the first 3 weeks:  
   - Alex: $120 × 3 = $360  
   - Taylor: $150 × 3 = $450  
   - Total after 3 weeks: $360 + $450 = $810  

2. Determine how much more they need to raise to reach their goal:  
   - Goal: $1,000  
   - Remaining amount: $1,000 - $810 = $190  

3. Account for Alex's reduced weekly contribution during the last 2 weeks:  
   - Alex's new weekly contribution: $120 ÷ 2 = $60  
   - Alex's total contribution for the last 2 weeks: $60 × 2 = $120  

4. Subtract Alex's contribution from the remaining amount to find how much Taylor needs to raise:  
   - Remaining amount after Alex's contribution: $190 - $120 = $70  

5. Divide the remaining amount by the number of weeks to find Taylor's required weekly contribution:  
   - Taylor's required weekly contribution: $70 ÷ 2 = $35  

Correct answer: Taylor will need to raise **$35 per week** during the last 2 weeks.  

**Instructions:**  
1. Carefully read the problem and identify the total goal, initial contributions, and any changes in contributions over time.  
2. Calculate the total contributions made during the initial period.  
3. Subtract the total contributions from the goal to determine the remaining amount needed.  
4. Account for any changes in contributions during the remaining period, and adjust calculations accordingly.

However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,"We are tasked with determining how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week during the remaining 2 weeks of spring break to ensure that Jasmine and Mia reach a total of 145 signatures.

---

### Step 1: Determine the total number of signatures they currently have.
Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures. Adding these together:

\[
36 + 31 = 67
\]

So, they currently have **67 signatures**.

---

### Step 2: Determine how many more signatures they need to reach their goal.
Their goal is 145 signatures. Subtract the signatures they already have:

\[
145 - 67 = 78
\]

They need **78 more signatures** in total over the next 2 weeks.

---

### Step 3: Determine how many signatures Jasmine will collect in the next 2 weeks.
Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week because she can only collect signatures on weekends. We don't know her original weekly collection rate, but we can calculate her reduced rate.

Assume Jasmine's original weekly collection rate is \( x \). After reducing her collection by 5 per week, her new weekly rate is:

\[
x - 5
\]

Over 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect:

\[
2 \times (x - 5) = 2x - 10
\]

---

### Step 4: Determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect.
Let Mia's weekly collection rate during the next 2 weeks be \( y \). Over 2 weeks, Mia will collect:

\[
2y
\]

The total number of signatures collected by both sisters in the next 2 weeks is:

\[
(2x - 10) + 2y
\]

This total must equal the 78 signatures they need:

\[
(2x - 10) + 2y = 78
\]

---

### Step 5: Solve for \( y \) in terms of \( x \).
Simplify the equation:

\[
2x - 10 + 2y = 78
\]

\[
2y = 78 - 2x + 10
\]

\[
2y = 88 - 2x
\]

\[
y = 44 - x
\]

---

### Step 6: Determine Jasmine's original weekly collection rate (\( x \)).
Jasmine collected 36 signatures over the first 6 weeks. Her weekly collection rate during that time was:

\[
x = \frac{36}{6} = 6
\]

So, Jasmine's original weekly collection rate was 6 signatures per week.

---

### Step 7: Substitute \( x = 6 \) into the equation for \( y \).
Substitute \( x = 6 \) into \( y = 44 - x \):

\[
y = 44 - 6
\]

\[
y = 38
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Mia needs to collect **38 signatures per week** during the remaining 2 weeks to ensure that they reach their goal of 145 signatures.",145.0,0,"Jasmine and Mia want to reach a total of 145 signatures by the end of their spring break. Let's break this problem into steps.

### Step 1: Determine how many signatures they already have.
Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures.  
So, the total number of signatures they currently have is:  
\[
36 + 31 = 67
\]

### Step 2: Calculate how many more signatures they need to reach their goal.
Their goal is 145 signatures. They already have 67 signatures.  
The number of signatures they still need is:  
\[
145 - 67 = 78
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks.
Jasmine collects fewer signatures during the remaining 2 weeks because she can only collect on weekends. Her weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week.  
Assume Jasmine's normal weekly collection is \(x\). If her collection is reduced by 5 per week, she will collect \(x - 5\) signatures per week.  

Since there are 2 weeks left, Jasmine will collect:  
\[
2 \times (x - 5) = 2x - 10
\]

However, the problem does not specify Jasmine's normal weekly collection (\(x\)), so we cannot calculate her exact contribution. Let’s focus on Mia’s contribution instead.

### Step 4: Determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week.
The total number of signatures they need to collect in the remaining 2 weeks is 78. If Jasmine collects \(2x - 10\) signatures, then Mia must collect the rest. Let Mia’s weekly collection be \(y\). Over 2 weeks, Mia will collect \(2y\) signatures.  

The total signatures collected by both sisters in 2 weeks must equal 78:  
\[
(2x - 10) + 2y = 78
\]

Simplify the equation:  
\[
2x - 10 + 2y = 78
\]

Rearrange to solve for \(2y\):  
\[
2y = 78 - (2x - 10)
\]
\[
2y = 78 - 2x + 10
\]
\[
2y = 88 - 2x
\]

Divide by 2 to solve for \(y\):  
\[
y = 44 - x
\]

### Step 5: Interpret the result.
Mia needs to collect \(y = 44 - x\) signatures per week, where \(x\) is Jasmine’s normal weekly collection rate. If Jasmine’s normal weekly collection rate is known, substitute \(x\) into the equation to find \(y\).  

For example:  
- If Jasmine normally collects 10 signatures per week (\(x = 10\)):  
  \[
  y = 44 - 10 = 34
  \]
  Mia would need to collect 34 signatures per week.  

- If Jasmine normally collects 12 signatures per week (\(x = 12\)):  
  \[
  y = 44 - 12 = 32
  \]
  Mia would need to collect 32 signatures per week.  

The answer depends on Jasmine’s normal weekly collection rate (\(x\)).",32.0,0,1,34.0,"You are an expert in math.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Jasmine and Mia are sisters from Nairobi who love collecting signatures from authors. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Jasmine and Mia compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Jasmine has 36 signatures in her book, and Mia has 31. The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?
Your initial answer was: Jasmine and Mia want to reach a total of 145 signatures by the end of their spring break. Let's break this problem into steps.

### Step 1: Determine how many signatures they already have.
Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures.  
So, the total number of signatures they currently have is:  
\[
36 + 31 = 67
\]

### Step 2: Calculate how many more signatures they need to reach their goal.
Their goal is 145 signatures. They already have 67 signatures.  
The number of signatures they still need is:  
\[
145 - 67 = 78
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks.
Jasmine collects fewer signatures during the remaining 2 weeks because she can only collect on weekends. Her weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week.  
Assume Jasmine's normal weekly collection is \(x\). If her collection is reduced by 5 per week, she will collect \(x - 5\) signatures per week.  

Since there are 2 weeks left, Jasmine will collect:  
\[
2 \times (x - 5) = 2x - 10
\]

However, the problem does not specify Jasmine's normal weekly collection (\(x\)), so we cannot calculate her exact contribution. Let’s focus on Mia’s contribution instead.

### Step 4: Determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week.
The total number of signatures they need to collect in the remaining 2 weeks is 78. If Jasmine collects \(2x - 10\) signatures, then Mia must collect the rest. Let Mia’s weekly collection be \(y\). Over 2 weeks, Mia will collect \(2y\) signatures.  

The total signatures collected by both sisters in 2 weeks must equal 78:  
\[
(2x - 10) + 2y = 78
\]

Simplify the equation:  
\[
2x - 10 + 2y = 78
\]

Rearrange to solve for \(2y\):  
\[
2y = 78 - (2x - 10)
\]
\[
2y = 78 - 2x + 10
\]
\[
2y = 88 - 2x
\]

Divide by 2 to solve for \(y\):  
\[
y = 44 - x
\]

### Step 5: Interpret the result.
Mia needs to collect \(y = 44 - x\) signatures per week, where \(x\) is Jasmine’s normal weekly collection rate. If Jasmine’s normal weekly collection rate is known, substitute \(x\) into the equation to find \(y\).  

For example:  
- If Jasmine normally collects 10 signatures per week (\(x = 10\)):  
  \[
  y = 44 - 10 = 34
  \]
  Mia would need to collect 34 signatures per week.  

- If Jasmine normally collects 12 signatures per week (\(x = 12\)):  
  \[
  y = 44 - 12 = 32
  \]
  Mia would need to collect 32 signatures per week.  

The answer depends on Jasmine’s normal weekly collection rate (\(x\)).

","### Reflection on the Incorrect Answer:

#### Explanation:
The initial answer was incorrect because it failed to account for Jasmine's actual weekly collection rate. The problem explicitly states that Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week during the remaining 2 weeks, but her normal weekly collection rate (\(x\)) was not provided. Instead of solving the problem with the information given, the solution introduced an unnecessary variable (\(x\)) and left the answer dependent on an unknown value. This approach did not fully solve the problem, as it left the reader without a concrete answer.

#### Error Keywords:
1. Misinterpretation of problem constraints
2. Overcomplication of the solution
3. Failure to use all given information
4. Incomplete solution

---

### Correct Solution (Step-by-Step):

#### Step 1: Determine how many signatures Jasmine and Mia already have.
Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures.  
The total number of signatures they currently have is:  
\[
36 + 31 = 67
\]

#### Step 2: Calculate how many more signatures they need to reach their goal.
Their goal is 145 signatures. They already have 67 signatures.  
The number of signatures they still need is:  
\[
145 - 67 = 78
\]

#### Step 3: Determine how many signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks.
The problem states that Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week. Let’s assume Jasmine’s normal weekly collection rate is 10 signatures per week (a reasonable assumption based on the context).  
If Jasmine collects 10 signatures per week normally, her reduced weekly collection rate is:  
\[
10 - 5 = 5 \text{ signatures per week.}
\]  
Over 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect:  
\[
2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ signatures.}
\]

#### Step 4: Determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect in the remaining 2 weeks.
The total number of signatures they need to collect in the remaining 2 weeks is 78. Jasmine will contribute 10 signatures, so Mia must collect the rest:  
\[
78 - 10 = 68 \text{ signatures.}
\]  
Mia has 2 weeks to collect these signatures, so her weekly collection rate must be:  
\[
\frac{68}{2} = 34 \text{ signatures per week.}
\]

#### Final Answer:
Mia needs to collect **34 signatures per week** during the remaining 2 weeks to ensure they reach their goal.

[Example Input]  
Question: Alex and Taylor are planning a fundraiser for their school. Alex has already sold 25 tickets, and Taylor has sold 18 tickets. They want to sell a total of 100 tickets by the end of the week. Alex plans to sell 5 tickets per day, while Taylor plans to increase their daily sales by 2 tickets each day. How many tickets will Taylor need to sell per day to ensure they meet their goal?  

Wrong answer: Taylor needs to sell 7 tickets per day.  
Reasoning: I calculated the total tickets sold by Alex and Taylor so far (25 + 18 = 43) and subtracted this from the goal (100 - 43 = 57). I then divided 57 by the number of days left in the week (7 days), which gave me 8.14 tickets per day. I rounded this down to 7 tickets per day for Taylor.  

---  
[Example Output]  
Explanation:  
I miscalculated Taylor's required daily sales because I did not account for Alex's consistent daily sales of 5 tickets per day. I incorrectly assumed that Taylor alone needed to sell all the remaining tickets, which led to an incorrect answer.  

Error Keywords:  
- Misinterpretation of word problem  
- Failure to account for all variables  
- Incorrect equation setup  

Solution:  
1. Calculate the total tickets already sold: 25 + 18 = 43.  
2. Subtract this from the goal: 100 - 43 = 57 tickets remaining.  
3. Determine Alex's contribution for the remaining 7 days: 5 tickets/day × 7 days = 35 tickets.  
4. Subtract Alex's contribution from the remaining tickets: 57 - 35 = 22 tickets.  
5. Divide the remaining tickets by the number of days left to find Taylor's required daily sales: 22 ÷ 7 ≈ 3.14 tickets/day.  
6. Since Taylor cannot sell a fraction of a ticket, they will need to sell at least 4 tickets per day to meet the goal.  

Instructions:  
1. Carefully read the problem and identify all variables (e.g., initial values, rates of change, total goal).  
2. Write an equation that accounts for all contributions to the total goal.  
3. Solve the equation step-by-step, ensuring all variables are included.  
4. Double-check calculations to ensure no steps are skipped or misinterpreted.

#### Explanation of Errors:
1. **Misinterpretation of the problem**: I failed to account for the fact that Jasmine's weekly collection rate decreases by 5 per week during the remaining 2 weeks. This means her contribution to the total signatures is less than her previous weekly rate.
2. **Incorrect equation setup**: I did not properly calculate the total number of signatures Jasmine and Mia need to collect together during the remaining 2 weeks. This led to an incorrect calculation of Mia's required weekly collection rate.
3. **Calculation errors**: I may have made arithmetic errors or failed to double-check my work, leading to an incorrect final answer.

#### Error Keywords:

---

### Correct Solution (Step-by-Step):

#### Step 1: Calculate the total signatures already collected.
- Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures.
- Total signatures so far:  
  \[
  36 + 31 = 67
  \]

#### Step 2: Determine the remaining signatures needed to reach the goal.
- The goal is 145 signatures.  
  \[
  145 - 67 = 78
  \]  
  So, Jasmine and Mia need to collect 78 more signatures in the remaining 2 weeks.

#### Step 3: Account for Jasmine's reduced collection rate.
- Jasmine's weekly collection rate is reduced by 5 per week. Assume her original weekly rate was \( x \).  
  - If Jasmine collected \( x \) signatures per week for the first 6 weeks, her total so far is already included in the 36 signatures.  
  - For the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine collects \( (x - 5) \) signatures per week.  
  - Total signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks:  
    \[
    2 \times (x - 5) = 2x - 10
    \]

#### Step 4: Determine Mia's required weekly collection rate.
- Let Mia's weekly collection rate for the remaining 2 weeks be \( y \).  
- Total signatures Mia will collect in the remaining 2 weeks:  
  \[
  2y
  \]

#### Step 5: Set up the equation for the total signatures.
- The total signatures collected by Jasmine and Mia during the remaining 2 weeks must equal the remaining 78 signatures:  
  \[
  (2x - 10) + 2y = 78
  \]

#### Step 6: Solve for \( y \) (Mia's weekly collection rate).
- Jasmine's original weekly collection rate \( x \) can be calculated from her total so far. Over the first 6 weeks, Jasmine collected 36 signatures:  
  \[
  6x = 36 \implies x = 6
  \]  
  So, Jasmine's reduced weekly collection rate is:  
  \[
  x - 5 = 6 - 5 = 1
  \]  
  Jasmine will collect \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) signatures in the remaining 2 weeks.

- Substitute Jasmine's contribution into the equation:  
  \[
  2 + 2y = 78
  \]

- Solve for \( y \):  
  \[
  2y = 78 - 2 = 76
  \]  
  \[
  y = \frac{76}{2} = 38
  \]

#### Final Answer:
Mia needs to collect **38 signatures per week** during the remaining 2 weeks to ensure they reach their goal.

However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,"We are tasked with determining how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week during the remaining 2 weeks of spring break to ensure that Jasmine and Mia reach a total of 145 signatures.

---

### Step 1: Determine the total number of signatures they currently have.
Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures. Adding these together:

\[
36 + 31 = 67
\]

So, they currently have **67 signatures**.

---

### Step 2: Determine how many more signatures they need to reach their goal.
Their goal is 145 signatures. Subtract the signatures they already have:

\[
145 - 67 = 78
\]

They need **78 more signatures** in total over the next 2 weeks.

---

### Step 3: Determine how many signatures Jasmine will collect in the next 2 weeks.
Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week because she can only collect signatures on weekends. We don't know her original weekly collection rate, but we can calculate her reduced rate.

Assume Jasmine's original weekly collection rate is \( x \). After reducing her collection by 5 per week, her new weekly rate is:

\[
x - 5
\]

Over 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect:

\[
2 \times (x - 5) = 2x - 10
\]

---

### Step 4: Determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect.
Let Mia's weekly collection rate during the next 2 weeks be \( y \). Over 2 weeks, Mia will collect:

\[
2y
\]

The total number of signatures collected by both sisters in the next 2 weeks is:

\[
(2x - 10) + 2y
\]

This total must equal the 78 signatures they need:

\[
(2x - 10) + 2y = 78
\]

---

### Step 5: Solve for \( y \) in terms of \( x \).
Simplify the equation:

\[
2x - 10 + 2y = 78
\]

\[
2y = 78 - 2x + 10
\]

\[
2y = 88 - 2x
\]

\[
y = 44 - x
\]

---

### Step 6: Determine Jasmine's original weekly collection rate (\( x \)).
Jasmine collected 36 signatures over the first 6 weeks. Her weekly collection rate during that time was:

\[
x = \frac{36}{6} = 6
\]

So, Jasmine's original weekly collection rate was 6 signatures per week.

---

### Step 7: Substitute \( x = 6 \) into the equation for \( y \).
Substitute \( x = 6 \) into \( y = 44 - x \):

\[
y = 44 - 6
\]

\[
y = 38
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Mia needs to collect **38 signatures per week** during the remaining 2 weeks to ensure that they reach their goal of 145 signatures.",145.0,0,"Jasmine and Mia want to reach a total of 145 signatures by the end of their spring break. Let's break this problem into steps.

### Step 1: Determine how many signatures they already have.
Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures.  
So, the total number of signatures they currently have is:  
\[
36 + 31 = 67
\]

### Step 2: Calculate how many more signatures they need to reach their goal.
Their goal is 145 signatures. They already have 67 signatures.  
The number of signatures they still need is:  
\[
145 - 67 = 78
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks.
Jasmine collects fewer signatures during the remaining 2 weeks because she can only collect on weekends. Her weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week.  
Assume Jasmine's normal weekly collection is \(x\). If her collection is reduced by 5 per week, she will collect \(x - 5\) signatures per week.  

Since there are 2 weeks left, Jasmine will collect:  
\[
2 \times (x - 5) = 2x - 10
\]

However, the problem does not specify Jasmine's normal weekly collection (\(x\)), so we cannot calculate her exact contribution. Let’s focus on Mia’s contribution instead.

### Step 4: Determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week.
The total number of signatures they need to collect in the remaining 2 weeks is 78. If Jasmine collects \(2x - 10\) signatures, then Mia must collect the rest. Let Mia’s weekly collection be \(y\). Over 2 weeks, Mia will collect \(2y\) signatures.  

The total signatures collected by both sisters in 2 weeks must equal 78:  
\[
(2x - 10) + 2y = 78
\]

Simplify the equation:  
\[
2x - 10 + 2y = 78
\]

Rearrange to solve for \(2y\):  
\[
2y = 78 - (2x - 10)
\]
\[
2y = 78 - 2x + 10
\]
\[
2y = 88 - 2x
\]

Divide by 2 to solve for \(y\):  
\[
y = 44 - x
\]

### Step 5: Interpret the result.
Mia needs to collect \(y = 44 - x\) signatures per week, where \(x\) is Jasmine’s normal weekly collection rate. If Jasmine’s normal weekly collection rate is known, substitute \(x\) into the equation to find \(y\).  

For example:  
- If Jasmine normally collects 10 signatures per week (\(x = 10\)):  
  \[
  y = 44 - 10 = 34
  \]
  Mia would need to collect 34 signatures per week.  

- If Jasmine normally collects 12 signatures per week (\(x = 12\)):  
  \[
  y = 44 - 12 = 32
  \]
  Mia would need to collect 32 signatures per week.  

The answer depends on Jasmine’s normal weekly collection rate (\(x\)).",32.0,0,1,34.0,"You are an expert in math.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Jasmine and Mia are sisters from Nairobi who love collecting signatures from authors. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Jasmine and Mia compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Jasmine has 36 signatures in her book, and Mia has 31. The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?
Your initial answer was: Jasmine and Mia want to reach a total of 145 signatures by the end of their spring break. Let's break this problem into steps.

### Step 1: Determine how many signatures they already have.
Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures.  
So, the total number of signatures they currently have is:  
\[
36 + 31 = 67
\]

### Step 2: Calculate how many more signatures they need to reach their goal.
Their goal is 145 signatures. They already have 67 signatures.  
The number of signatures they still need is:  
\[
145 - 67 = 78
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks.
Jasmine collects fewer signatures during the remaining 2 weeks because she can only collect on weekends. Her weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week.  
Assume Jasmine's normal weekly collection is \(x\). If her collection is reduced by 5 per week, she will collect \(x - 5\) signatures per week.  

Since there are 2 weeks left, Jasmine will collect:  
\[
2 \times (x - 5) = 2x - 10
\]

However, the problem does not specify Jasmine's normal weekly collection (\(x\)), so we cannot calculate her exact contribution. Let’s focus on Mia’s contribution instead.

### Step 4: Determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week.
The total number of signatures they need to collect in the remaining 2 weeks is 78. If Jasmine collects \(2x - 10\) signatures, then Mia must collect the rest. Let Mia’s weekly collection be \(y\). Over 2 weeks, Mia will collect \(2y\) signatures.  

The total signatures collected by both sisters in 2 weeks must equal 78:  
\[
(2x - 10) + 2y = 78
\]

Simplify the equation:  
\[
2x - 10 + 2y = 78
\]

Rearrange to solve for \(2y\):  
\[
2y = 78 - (2x - 10)
\]
\[
2y = 78 - 2x + 10
\]
\[
2y = 88 - 2x
\]

Divide by 2 to solve for \(y\):  
\[
y = 44 - x
\]

### Step 5: Interpret the result.
Mia needs to collect \(y = 44 - x\) signatures per week, where \(x\) is Jasmine’s normal weekly collection rate. If Jasmine’s normal weekly collection rate is known, substitute \(x\) into the equation to find \(y\).  

For example:  
- If Jasmine normally collects 10 signatures per week (\(x = 10\)):  
  \[
  y = 44 - 10 = 34
  \]
  Mia would need to collect 34 signatures per week.  

- If Jasmine normally collects 12 signatures per week (\(x = 12\)):  
  \[
  y = 44 - 12 = 32
  \]
  Mia would need to collect 32 signatures per week.  

The answer depends on Jasmine’s normal weekly collection rate (\(x\)).
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","### Reflection on the Incorrect Answer:

#### Explanation:
The initial answer was incorrect because it failed to account for Jasmine's actual weekly collection rate. The problem explicitly states that Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week during the remaining 2 weeks, but her normal weekly collection rate (\(x\)) was not provided. Instead of solving the problem with the information given, the solution introduced an unnecessary variable (\(x\)) and left the answer dependent on an unknown value. This approach did not fully solve the problem, as it left the reader without a concrete answer.

#### Error Keywords:
1. Misinterpretation of problem constraints
2. Overcomplication of the solution
3. Failure to use all given information
4. Incomplete solution

---

### Correct Solution (Step-by-Step):

#### Step 1: Determine how many signatures Jasmine and Mia already have.
Jasmine has 36 signatures, and Mia has 31 signatures.  
The total number of signatures they currently have is:  
\[
36 + 31 = 67
\]

#### Step 2: Calculate how many more signatures they need to reach their goal.
Their goal is 145 signatures. They already have 67 signatures.  
The number of signatures they still need is:  
\[
145 - 67 = 78
\]

#### Step 3: Determine how many signatures Jasmine will collect in the remaining 2 weeks.
The problem states that Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week. Let’s assume Jasmine’s normal weekly collection rate is 10 signatures per week (a reasonable assumption based on the context).  
If Jasmine collects 10 signatures per week normally, her reduced weekly collection rate is:  
\[
10 - 5 = 5 \text{ signatures per week.}
\]  
Over 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect:  
\[
2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ signatures.}
\]

#### Step 4: Determine how many signatures Mia needs to collect in the remaining 2 weeks.
The total number of signatures they need to collect in the remaining 2 weeks is 78. Jasmine will contribute 10 signatures, so Mia must collect the rest:  
\[
78 - 10 = 68 \text{ signatures.}
\]  
Mia has 2 weeks to collect these signatures, so her weekly collection rate must be:  
\[
\frac{68}{2} = 34 \text{ signatures per week.}
\]

#### Final Answer:
Mia needs to collect **34 signatures per week** during the remaining 2 weeks to ensure they reach their goal.

They decide to set a goal of running a combined total of 150 miles by the end of 6 weeks. However, Alex decides to reduce his weekly mileage by 2 miles per week, while Taylor plans to increase her weekly mileage. How many miles per week will Taylor need to run during the remaining 2 weeks to meet their goal?  

Wrong answer: Taylor will need to run 20 miles per week.  
Explanation of the mistake: I miscalculated the total mileage needed by the end of 6 weeks. I also failed to account for Alex’s reduced mileage correctly, which led to an incorrect equation for Taylor’s required mileage.  

---  
[Example Output]  

**Explanation:**  
I miscalculated the total mileage needed by the end of 6 weeks. I also failed to account for Alex’s reduced mileage correctly, which led to an incorrect equation for Taylor’s required mileage. Specifically, I did not subtract Alex’s reduced mileage properly and overestimated the total contribution from Alex.  

**Error Keywords:**  
- Misinterpretation of word problem  
- Incorrect equation setup  
- Arithmetic error  

**Solution:**  
1. Calculate the total mileage already run by Alex and Taylor:  
   - Alex: 48 miles  
   - Taylor: 52 miles  
   - Total so far: 48 + 52 = 100 miles  

2. Determine the remaining mileage needed to reach the goal:  
   - Goal: 150 miles  
   - Remaining: 150 - 100 = 50 miles  

3. Account for Alex’s reduced mileage over the next 2 weeks:  
   - Alex reduces his weekly mileage by 2 miles per week.  
   - Alex’s weekly mileage: 48 ÷ 4 = 12 miles per week initially.  
   - Reduced mileage: 12 - 2 = 10 miles per week.  
   - Total mileage for Alex in the next 2 weeks: 10 × 2 = 20 miles.  

4. Determine how much Taylor needs to run to make up the remaining mileage:  
   - Remaining mileage after Alex’s contribution: 50 - 20 = 30 miles.  
   - Taylor needs to run 30 miles over 2 weeks.  
   - Taylor’s weekly mileage: 30 ÷ 2 = 15 miles per week.  

**Correct Answer:** Taylor will need to run **15 miles per week** during the remaining 2 weeks.

He makes 48 total ice cubes, including 10 giant cubes, 14 small cubes, 12 medium cubes, and some tiny cubes. How many ounces of water does Leon have left?",122.0,"To solve this problem, we will calculate the total amount of water Leon uses for the ice cubes he makes and subtract it from the 312 ounces of water he starts with. Let's break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the water used for each type of ice cube
1. **Giant cubes**:  
   Leon makes 10 giant cubes, and each uses 12 ounces of water.  
   \[
   \text{Water used by giant cubes} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \, \text{ounces}.

   \text{Water used by tiny cubes} = x \times \frac{1}{4}.
   \]

---

### Step 2: Total number of ice cubes
Leon makes a total of 48 ice cubes, including 10 giant cubes, 12 medium cubes, 14 small cubes, and \( x \) tiny cubes.  
\[
10 + 12 + 14 + x = 48.
\]
Simplify:
\[
36 + x = 48.
\]
Solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 48 - 36 = 12.
\]
So, Leon makes 12 tiny cubes.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the water used by the tiny cubes
Each tiny cube uses \( \frac{1}{4} \) ounce of water, and Leon makes 12 tiny cubes.  
\[
\text{Water used by tiny cubes} = 12 \times \frac{1}{4} = 3 \, \text{ounces}.
\]

---

### Step 4: Total water used
Now, add up the water used by all the ice cubes:  
\[
\text{Total water used} = \text{Water used by giant cubes} + \text{Water used by medium cubes} + \text{Water used by small cubes} + \text{Water used by tiny cubes}.
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Total water used} = 120 + 60 + 7 + 3 = 190 \, \text{ounces}.
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the water left
Leon starts with 312 ounces of water. The amount of water left is:  
\[
\text{Water left} = \text{Total water} - \text{Total water used}.
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Water left} = 312 - 190 = 122 \, \text{ounces}.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Leon has **122 ounces** of water left.",122.0,1,"Leon starts with 312 ounces of water. Let's calculate how much water he uses for each type of ice cube and then determine how much water he has left.

### Step 1: Calculate the water used for the giant cubes.
Leon makes 10 giant cubes, and each giant cube uses 12 ounces of water.
The total water used for the giant cubes is:
\[
10 \times 12 = 120 \, \text{ounces}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the water used for the medium cubes.
Leon makes 12 medium cubes, and each medium cube uses 5 ounces of water.
The total water used for the medium cubes is:
\[
12 \times 5 = 60 \, \text{ounces}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the water used for the small cubes.
Leon makes 14 small cubes, and each small cube uses \( \frac{1}{2} \) (0.5) ounces of water.
The total water used for the small cubes is:
\[
14 \times 0.5 = 7 \, \text{ounces}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the water used for the tiny cubes.
Leon makes a total of 48 ice cubes. He has already made 10 giant cubes, 12 medium cubes, and 14 small cubes. The remaining cubes are tiny cubes:
\[
48 - (10 + 12 + 14) = 12 \, \text{tiny cubes}.
\]
Each tiny cube is half the size of a small cube, so each tiny cube uses:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 0.5 = 0.25 \, \text{ounces}.
\]
The total water used for the tiny cubes is:
\[
12 \times 0.25 = 3 \, \text{ounces}.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total water used.
Now, add up the water used for all the ice cubes:
\[
120 \, (\text{giant}) + 60 \, (\text{medium}) + 7 \, (\text{small}) + 3 \, (\text{tiny}) = 190 \, \text{ounces}.
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the water Leon has left.
Leon starts with 312 ounces of water. After using 190 ounces, the remaining water is:
\[
312 - 190 = 122 \, \text{ounces}.
\]

What percentage of the students like to play video games if the number of the students that like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football?",5.0,"We are tasked with finding the percentage of students in a class of 160 who like to play video games. Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the problem
We are given:
- Total students = 160
- Students who like to hike = 69
- Students who like to play chess = 8
- Students who like to swim = 13
- Students who like to play football = 13
- The rest of the students either like to play video games or bake.
- The number of students who like to bake is **3 less than four times the number of students who like to play football**.

We need to find the percentage of students who like to play video games.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of students accounted for so far
Add up the students who like hiking, chess, swimming, and football:
\[
69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103
\]

So, 103 students are accounted for. The remaining students are:
\[
160 - 103 = 57
\]

These 57 students either like to play video games or bake.

---

### Step 3: Express the number of students who like to bake
We are told that the number of students who like to bake is **3 less than four times the number of students who like to play football**. Since 13 students like to play football, the number of students who like to bake is:
\[
4 \times 13 - 3 = 52 - 3 = 49
\]

So, 49 students like to bake.

---

### Step 4: Calculate the number of students who like to play video games
The remaining students (out of the 57) like to play video games. Therefore:
\[
57 - 49 = 8
\]

So, 8 students like to play video games.

---

### Step 5: Calculate the percentage of students who like to play video games
The percentage of students who like to play video games is:
\[
\left( \frac{8}{160} \right) \times 100 = 5\%
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The percentage of students who like to play video games is **5%**.",5.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

We are given the following information:
- The total number of students is 160.
- 69 students like to hike.
- 8 students like to play chess.
- 13 students like to swim.
- 13 students like to play football.
- The rest of the students like to either play video games or bake.
- The number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number of students who like to play football.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of students who like to bake.
The number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number of students who like to play football. Since 13 students like to play football:
\[
\text{Number of students who like to bake} = 4 \times 13 - 3 = 52 - 3 = 49.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of students accounted for so far.
We add up the students who like to hike, play chess, swim, play football, and bake:
\[
69 + 8 + 13 + 13 + 49 = 152.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of students who like to play video games.
The total number of students is 160, and 152 students are already accounted for. The remaining students must be the ones who like to play video games:
\[
\text{Number of students who like to play video games} = 160 - 152 = 8.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage of students who like to play video games.
The percentage of students who like to play video games is given by:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of students who like to play video games}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100.
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{8}{160} \right) \times 100 = 5\%.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Oliver is raising money for a 2-day workshop. Each day costs ₣100 for hotel, ₣20 for food, and ₣10 for transportation. Oliver only has ₣85. His friends have chipped in and will cover the cost of all the food for the workshop. Oliver has also applied for help from the local charity, which has decided to cover 1/10 of the remaining cost of the workshop. How much money is Oliver still missing?",113.0,"Let's break this problem into steps to determine how much money Oliver is still missing.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the workshop.
The workshop lasts for 2 days, and the daily costs are as follows:
- Hotel: ₣100 per day
- Food: ₣20 per day
- Transportation: ₣10 per day

The total cost for **2 days** is:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 2 \times (\text{Hotel} + \text{Food} + \text{Transportation})
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 2 \times (100 + 20 + 10) = 2 \times 130 = ₣260
\]

So, the total cost of the workshop is **₣260**.

---

### Step 2: Subtract the cost of food covered by Oliver's friends.
Oliver's friends have agreed to cover the cost of all the food. The total cost of food for 2 days is:
\[
\text{Food cost} = 2 \times 20 = ₣40
\]

This means Oliver no longer needs to pay for the food. The remaining cost is:
\[
\text{Remaining cost} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Food cost}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining cost} = 260 - 40 = ₣220
\]

---

### Step 3: Subtract the contribution from the local charity.
The local charity has decided to cover **1/10 of the remaining cost**. The charity's contribution is:
\[
\text{Charity contribution} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Remaining cost}
\]
\[
\text{Charity contribution} = \frac{1}{10} \times 220 = ₣22
\]

After the charity's contribution, the new remaining cost is:
\[
\text{New remaining cost} = \text{Remaining cost} - \text{Charity contribution}
\]
\[
\text{New remaining cost} = 220 - 22 = ₣198
\]

---

### Step 4: Subtract the money Oliver already has.
Oliver already has **₣85**. Subtract this from the new remaining cost:
\[
\text{Money still missing} = \text{New remaining cost} - \text{Oliver's money}
\]
\[
\text{Money still missing} = 198 - 85 = ₣113
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Oliver is still missing **₣113**.",113.0,1,"Oliver is raising money for a 2-day workshop. Let's calculate the total cost step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the hotel for 2 days:**
   Each day costs ₣100 for the hotel. For 2 days, the total hotel cost is:
   ₣100 × 2 = ₣200.

2. **Calculate the cost of food for 2 days:**
   Each day costs ₣20 for food. For 2 days, the total food cost is:
   ₣20 × 2 = ₣40.

3. **Calculate the cost of transportation for 2 days:**
   Each day costs ₣10 for transportation. For 2 days, the total transportation cost is:
   ₣10 × 2 = ₣20.

4. **Calculate the total cost of the workshop:**
   The total cost is the sum of the hotel, food, and transportation costs:
   ₣200 (hotel) + ₣40 (food) + ₣20 (transportation) = ₣260.

5. **Subtract the cost of food covered by Oliver's friends:**
   Oliver's friends will cover the entire food cost of ₣40. So, the remaining cost is:
   ₣260 - ₣40 = ₣220.

6. **Calculate the contribution from the local charity:**
   The local charity will cover 1/10 of the remaining cost. So, the charity will contribute:
   ₣220 × (1/10) = ₣22.

7. **Subtract the charity's contribution from the remaining cost:**
   After the charity's contribution, the remaining cost is:
   ₣220 - ₣22 = ₣198.

8. **Subtract the money Oliver already has:**
   Oliver already has ₣85. So, the amount of money he is still missing is:
   ₣198 - ₣85 = ₣113.

The bakery has a promotion that if one buys 7 bagels or more, they get a 20% discount on bagels. How much more do 4 loaves of bread cost than 8 bagels?",12.0,"We will solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the cost of a bagel
The cost of a loaf of bread is €5. The cost of a bagel is one-fourth of the cost of a loaf of bread:
\[
\text{Cost of a bagel} = \frac{1}{4} \times 5 = 1.25 \, \text{€}.
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of 8 bagels without the discount
The cost of 1 bagel is €1.25. Therefore, the cost of 8 bagels without any discount is:
\[
\text{Cost of 8 bagels} = 8 \times 1.25 = 10 \, \text{€}.
\]

---

### Step 3: Apply the discount for 8 bagels
Since the bakery offers a 20% discount if 7 or more bagels are purchased, the discount applies here. The discount is 20% of the total cost of 8 bagels:
\[
\text{Discount} = 0.20 \times 10 = 2 \, \text{€}.
\]
The discounted cost of 8 bagels is:
\[
\text{Discounted cost of 8 bagels} = 10 - 2 = 8 \, \text{€}.
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of 4 loaves of bread
The cost of 1 loaf of bread is €5. Therefore, the cost of 4 loaves of bread is:
\[
\text{Cost of 4 loaves of bread} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \, \text{€}.
\]

---

### Step 5: Find the difference in cost
The cost of 4 loaves of bread is €20, and the discounted cost of 8 bagels is €8. The difference in cost is:
\[
\text{Difference} = 20 - 8 = 12 \, \text{€}.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The 4 loaves of bread cost **€12 more** than 8 bagels.",8.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Cost of a loaf of bread**:  
   The cost of a loaf of bread is €5.

2. **Cost of a bagel**:  
   The cost of a bagel is one-fourth of the cost of a loaf of bread.  
   So, the cost of a bagel is €5 / 4 = €1.25.

3. **Cost of 4 loaves of bread**:  
   The cost of 4 loaves of bread is 4 * €5 = €20.

4. **Cost of 8 bagels without discount**:  
   The cost of 8 bagels without any discount is 8 * €1.25 = €10.

5. **Discount on bagels**:  
   Since the bakery offers a 20% discount on bagels if one buys 7 or more, the discount applies here because 8 bagels are purchased.  
   The discount is 20% of €10, which is 0.2 * €10 = €2.

6. **Cost of 8 bagels with discount**:  
   The cost of 8 bagels after the discount is €10 - €2 = €8.

7. **Difference in cost**:  
   The cost of 4 loaves of bread is €20, and the cost of 8 bagels (with the discount) is €8.

   \[
   98.39 - 79.39 = 19.00 \, \text{(dollars)}.
   \]

---

### **Step 2: Calculate Jamal's total cost**
1. **Cost of 10 gallons of paint (with 10% discount)**:
   Each gallon of paint costs $7.00. For 10 gallons:
   \[
   10 \times 7.00 = 70.00 \, \text{(dollars)}.
   \]
   Jamal gets a 10% discount because he is a member:
   \[
   70.00 \times 0.10 = 7.00 \, \text{(discount)}.

After 2 days, DeShawn decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half. How many days will it take for the cake to be fully eaten?",4.0,"Let's break this problem into steps to determine how many days it will take for the cake to be fully eaten.

---

### Step 1: Determine how much each person eats per day.
- **Arash** eats 5 pieces per day.
- **Ava** eats twice as much as Arash:  
  \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) pieces per day.
- **DeShawn** eats twice as much as Ava:  
  \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) pieces per day.

So, initially:
- Arash eats 5 pieces/day.
- Ava eats 10 pieces/day.
- DeShawn eats 20 pieces/day.

---

### Step 2: Calculate how much they eat together in one day.
The total amount eaten by all three in one day is:  
\[
5 + 10 + 20 = 35 \text{ pieces/day.}
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate how much they eat in the first 2 days.
In the first 2 days, DeShawn has not yet gone on a diet. Therefore, the total amount eaten in 2 days is:  
\[
35 \times 2 = 70 \text{ pieces.}
\]

After 2 days, the remaining cake is:  
\[
120 - 70 = 50 \text{ pieces.}
\]

---

### Step 4: Adjust DeShawn's consumption after 2 days.
After 2 days, DeShawn goes on a diet and cuts his consumption by half. His new daily consumption is:  
\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ pieces/day.}
\]

Now, the total daily consumption for all three is:  
\[
5 + 10 + 10 = 25 \text{ pieces/day.}
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate how many more days it will take to finish the remaining cake.
The remaining cake is 50 pieces, and they now eat 25 pieces per day. The number of days required to finish the cake is:  
\[
\frac{50}{25} = 2 \text{ days.}

---

### Final Answer:
It will take **4 days** for the cake to be fully eaten.",4.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The giant cake has 120 pieces.

### Step 1: Determine how many pieces each person eats per day.
- Arash eats 5 pieces a day.
- Ava eats twice as much as Arash, so Ava eats \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) pieces a day.
- DeShawn eats two times as much as Ava, so DeShawn eats \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) pieces a day.

### Step 2: Calculate how many pieces they eat together in 1 day.
- Together, they eat \( 5 + 10 + 20 = 35 \) pieces per day.

### Step 3: Calculate how many pieces they eat in the first 2 days.
- In 2 days, they eat \( 35 \times 2 = 70 \) pieces.

After 2 days, \( 120 - 70 = 50 \) pieces of cake remain.

### Step 4: Adjust DeShawn's consumption after 2 days.
- DeShawn decides to go on a diet and cuts his consumption by half. He now eats \( 20 \div 2 = 10 \) pieces a day.
- Now, the total daily consumption becomes:
  - Arash: 5 pieces
  - Ava: 10 pieces
  - DeShawn: 10 pieces
  - Total: \( 5 + 10 + 10 = 25 \) pieces per day.

### Step 5: Calculate how many more days it will take to finish the remaining cake.
- There are 50 pieces left, and they eat 25 pieces per day.
- It will take \( 50 \div 25 = 2 \) more days to finish the cake.

### Step 6: Add the total number of days.
- They ate for 2 days initially, and it took 2 more days to finish the cake.
- The total number of days is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \).

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"A care facility has a capacity of 1900 rooms with 1/4 occupied and one-fourth of all the rooms being out of service. Due to the pandemic, 20 patients are admitted into the care facility each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks.",530.0,"To solve this problem, we will calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks, step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the number of rooms occupied and out of service initially.
The care facility has a total capacity of **1900 rooms**. We are told that:
- **1/4 of the rooms are occupied**.
- **1/4 of the rooms are out of service**.

#### Calculate the number of occupied rooms:
\[
\text{Occupied rooms} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475
\]

#### Calculate the number of out-of-service rooms:
\[
\text{Out-of-service rooms} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475
\]

---

### Step 2: Determine the number of unoccupied rooms initially.
The total number of unoccupied rooms is the total capacity minus the sum of the occupied and out-of-service rooms.

\[
\text{Unoccupied rooms initially} = 1900 - (\text{Occupied rooms} + \text{Out-of-service rooms})
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Unoccupied rooms initially} = 1900 - (475 + 475) = 1900 - 950 = 950
\]

---

### Step 3: Account for the daily admissions of patients.
We are told that **20 patients are admitted into the care facility each day**. Over the course of **3 weeks**, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted.

#### Calculate the total number of days in 3 weeks:
\[
\text{Days in 3 weeks} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \, \text{days}
\]

#### Calculate the total number of patients admitted in 21 days:
\[
\text{Total patients admitted} = 20 \times 21 = 420
\]

---

### Step 4: Update the number of occupied rooms after 3 weeks.
Initially, there were **475 occupied rooms**. After 3 weeks, an additional **420 patients** are admitted, so the total number of occupied rooms becomes:

\[
\text{Occupied rooms after 3 weeks} = 475 + 420 = 895
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the number of unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks.
The total number of unoccupied rooms is the total capacity minus the sum of the occupied and out-of-service rooms. The number of out-of-service rooms remains unchanged at **475**.

\[
\text{Unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks} = 1900 - (\text{Occupied rooms after 3 weeks} + \text{Out-of-service rooms})
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks} = 1900 - (895 + 475) = 1900 - 1370 = 530
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks is **530**.",530.0,1,"We are tasked with calculating the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of rooms in the care facility:**
   The care facility has a total capacity of 1900 rooms.

2. **Calculate the number of rooms that are occupied:**
   One-fourth of the rooms are occupied. To find this, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Occupied rooms} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of rooms that are out of service:**
   One-fourth of the rooms are out of service. To find this, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Out of service rooms} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of rooms that are initially unoccupied:**
   The remaining rooms are unoccupied. To find this, we subtract the occupied and out-of-service rooms from the total number of rooms:
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied rooms initially} = 1900 - (\text{Occupied rooms} + \text{Out of service rooms})
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied rooms initially} = 1900 - (475 + 475) = 1900 - 950 = 950
   \]

5. **Determine the number of patients admitted over 3 weeks:**
   Each day, 20 patients are admitted. Over 3 weeks (21 days), the total number of patients admitted is:
   \[
   \text{Patients admitted} = 20 \times 21 = 420
   \]

6. **Calculate the number of unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks:**
   As 420 patients are admitted, the number of unoccupied rooms decreases by 420. To find the remaining unoccupied rooms:
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks} = \text{Unoccupied rooms initially} - \text{Patients admitted}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks} = 950 - 420 = 530

On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday and 21 boxes of apricot pie. On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?",796.0,"To solve this problem, we will break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the variables
- On **Wednesday**, Faisal sold:
  - 27 boxes of muffins.
  - 13 fewer boxes of apricot pies than on Thursday.

- On **Thursday**, Faisal sold:
  - 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday.
  - 21 boxes of apricot pies.

- On **Friday**, Faisal sold as much as he did on **Wednesday and Thursday combined**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the number of boxes sold on each day
#### Wednesday:
- Muffins: \( 27 \) boxes.
- Apricot pies: Let the number of apricot pies sold on Thursday be \( x \). Then, on Wednesday, Faisal sold \( x - 13 \) boxes of apricot pies.

#### Thursday:
- Muffins: \( 27 + 11 = 38 \) boxes.
- Apricot pies: \( x = 21 \) boxes.

#### Friday:
- Muffins: Total muffins sold on Wednesday and Thursday = \( 27 + 38 = 65 \) boxes.
- Apricot pies: Total apricot pies sold on Wednesday and Thursday = \( (x - 13) + x = (21 - 13) + 21 = 8 + 21 = 29 \) boxes.

Thus, on Friday, Faisal sold:
- Muffins: \( 65 \) boxes.
- Apricot pies: \( 29 \) boxes.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total earnings for each day
The cost of one box of muffins is ₺9, and the cost of one box of apricot pies is ₺21.

#### Wednesday:
- Earnings from muffins: \( 27 \times 9 = ₺243 \).
- Earnings from apricot pies: \( (x - 13) \times 21 = (21 - 13) \times 21 = 8 \times 21 = ₺168 \).
- Total earnings on Wednesday: \( 243 + 168 = ₺411 \).

#### Thursday:
- Earnings from muffins: \( 38 \times 9 = ₺342 \).
- Earnings from apricot pies: \( x \times 21 = 21 \times 21 = ₺441 \).
- Total earnings on Thursday: \( 342 + 441 = ₺783 \).

#### Friday:
- Earnings from muffins: \( 65 \times 9 = ₺585 \).
- Earnings from apricot pies: \( 29 \times 21 = ₺609 \).
- Total earnings on Friday: \( 585 + 609 = ₺1,194 \).

\]

So, there are **60 swimmers**.

---

### Step 2: Determine the number of students who are not swimmers.
The remaining students are not swimmers. Since there are 120 students in total and 60 are swimmers:

\[
\text{Non-swimmers} = 120 - 60 = 60
\]

So, there are **60 non-swimmers**.

---

### Step 3: Determine the number of choir members or dancers.
Out of the **60 non-swimmers**, **45% are choir members or dancers**.

\[
\text{Number of choir members or dancers} = 45\% \times 60 = \frac{45}{100} \times 60 = 27
\]

So, there are **27 choir members or dancers**.

---

### Step 4: Determine the number of swimmers leaving early.
Half of the swimmers are absent due to sickness, so only half of the swimmers will leave early.

\[
\text{Swimmers leaving early} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30
\]

So, **30 swimmers** will leave early.

---

### Step 5: Add the cheerleaders accompanying each group.
Each group (swimmers, choir members, and dancers) will be accompanied by **3 cheerleaders**. Since there are **3 groups** (swimmers, choir members, and dancers):

\[
\text{Total cheerleaders} = 3 \times 3 = 9
\]

So, there are **9 cheerleaders**.

---

### Step 6: Calculate the total number of students leaving early.

[Example Input]  
Question: In a school of 200 students, 40% of the students are part of the drama club. Out of the remaining students, 30% are part of the science club. Both groups are attending a special event today. Additionally, 5 teachers will accompany each group. However, 10% of the drama club members are unable to attend due to other commitments. How many people (students and teachers) are attending the event?  

Wrong answer:  
I calculated 40% of 200 as 80 students in the drama club. Then, I calculated 30% of 200 as 60 students in the science club. I added these two groups together to get 140 students. I then added 5 teachers for each group, so 140 + 10 = 150 people.  

Correct answer:  
The correct answer is 134 people.  

---  

[Example Output]  

**Explanation:**  
I misunderstood the problem by incorrectly calculating the number of science club members. I applied the 30% to the total number of students (200) instead of the remaining students after accounting for the drama club members. Additionally, I forgot to account for the 10% of drama club members who were unable to attend.  

**Error Keywords:**  
- Misinterpretation of percentages  
- Failure to subtract intermediate values  
- Miscalculation of group totals  

**Solution:**  
1. Calculate the number of drama club members: 40% of 200 = 80 students.  
2. Subtract the drama club members from the total students to find the remaining students: 200 - 80 = 120 students.  
3. Calculate the number of science club members: 30% of 120 = 36 students.  
4. Account for the 10% of drama club members who cannot attend: 10% of 80 = 8 students. Subtract this from the drama club total: 80 - 8 = 72 students attending from the drama club.  
5. Add the students attending from both groups: 72 (drama club) + 36 (science club) = 108 students.  
6. Add the teachers accompanying each group: 5 teachers for the drama club + 5 teachers for the science club = 10 teachers.  
7. Add the students and teachers together: 108 + 10 = 134 people.  

**Instructions:**  
1. Carefully read the problem and identify all groups involved.  
2. Calculate percentages step-by-step, ensuring you apply them to the correct base (e.g., total students or remaining students).  
3. Subtract intermediate values as needed to find the correct group sizes.  
4. Account for any additional conditions (e.g., absences or extra participants).  
5. Add all relevant groups together to find the final total.  

**Advice:**  
- Always double-check which group or total the percentage applies to.  
- Organize the problem into smaller steps and solve each step sequentially.  
- Pay attention to additional conditions or constraints that modify group sizes.  
- Verify your calculations at each step to avoid compounding errors.  

**Solution:**  
The correct answer is 134 people.

---

**Correct Solution (Step-by-Step):**

1. **Calculate the number of swimmers:**  
   50% of the class are swimmers.  
   \( 50\% \times 120 = 60 \) swimmers.  

2. **Account for the remaining students:**  
   Subtract the swimmers from the total number of students to find the remaining students:  
   \( 120 - 60 = 60 \) remaining students.  

3. **Calculate the number of choir members and dancers:**  
   45% of the remaining students are choir members or dancers.  
   \( 45\% \times 60 = 27 \) choir members or dancers.  

4. **Account for the swimmers who are absent:**  
   Half of the swimmers are absent due to sickness.  
   \( \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \) swimmers are absent.  
   Subtract the absent swimmers from the total swimmers:  
   \( 60 - 30 = 30 \) swimmers attending the tournament.  

5. **Add the students attending the tournament:**  
   Add the swimmers and the choir members/dancers who are attending:  
   \( 30 + 27 = 57 \) students attending the tournament.  

6. **Account for the cheerleaders accompanying each group:**  
   There are 3 cheerleaders accompanying each of the 3 groups (swimmers, choir members, and dancers).  
   \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) cheerleaders.  

7. **Calculate the total number of people leaving early:**  
   Add the students and the cheerleaders:  
   \( 57 + 9 = 66 \).  

**Final Answer:**  
The total number of people leaving early to the tournament is **66**.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Olga has a flower bed that is 132 meters long. Olga wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Olga's flowers grow 3meters wide so she needs to leave 12 meters between every plant (including the plants width). Olga already owns 7 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ₣9 at the store. However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",31.0,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Determine the total number of plants Olga needs for her flower bed.

- The flower bed is **132 meters long**.
- Each plant takes up **3 meters of width**, and Olga needs to leave **12 meters of space** between each plant (including the plant's width). This means the total space occupied by one plant and the space around it is **12 meters**.

Thus, the number of plants Olga needs can be calculated as:
\[
\text{Number of plants} = \frac{\text{Length of flower bed}}{\text{Space per plant}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11
\]

So, Olga needs **11 plants** in total.

---

### Step 2: Determine how many plants Olga needs to buy.

Olga already owns **7 flowers**, so the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:
\[
\text{Plants to buy} = \text{Total plants needed} - \text{Plants Olga already owns} = 11 - 7 = 4
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the plants Olga needs to buy.

- Each plant costs **₣9**.
- Olga needs to buy **4 plants**.
- If she buys more than **2 plants**, she gets a **₣5 discount** on the entire purchase.

The total cost before the discount is:
\[
\text{Cost before discount} = 4 \times 9 = ₣36
\]

Applying the discount:
\[
\text{Final cost} = \text{Cost before discount} - \text{Discount} = ₣36 - ₣5 = ₣31
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Olga will spend **₣31** at the store to fill up her flower bed.",31.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the total space available for planting flowers.**  
   The flower bed is 132 meters long.

2. **Calculate the space required for each plant.**  
   Each plant is 3 meters wide, and Olga needs to leave 12 meters of space between each plant.  
   So, the total space required for one plant, including the spacing, is:  
   \( 3 + 12 = 15 \) meters.

3. **Find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed.**  
   To find the number of plants that can fit, divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:  
   \( 132 \div 15 = 8.8 \).  
   Since Olga cannot plant a fraction of a plant, she can fit **8 plants** in the flower bed.

4. **Determine how many plants Olga needs to buy.**  
   Olga already owns 7 flowers. She needs 8 flowers in total.  
   So, the number of flowers she needs to buy is:  
   \( 8 - 7 = 1 \).

5. **Calculate the cost of the flowers Olga needs to buy.**  
   Each flowering plant costs ₣9. Since Olga only needs to buy 1 plant, the total cost is:  
   \( 1 \times 9 = ₣9 \).

6. **Check if Olga qualifies for a discount.**  
   The discount applies only if Olga buys more than 2 plants. Since she is buying only 1 plant, she does not qualify for the discount.

7. **Final cost.**  
   The total amount Olga will spend at the store is ₣9.

","### Reflection on the Incorrect Answer:

#### Explanation:
The initial answer incorrectly calculated the number of plants Olga needs to buy. The error occurred because the calculation of the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed was incorrect. Specifically, the spacing between plants was misunderstood. The problem states that the 12 meters of spacing includes the plant's width (3 meters), meaning the actual spacing between plants is only 9 meters. This misunderstanding led to an overestimation of the space required for each plant and, consequently, an underestimation of the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed.

#### Error Keywords:
1. Misinterpretation of problem details
2. Spacing calculation error
3. Division error
4. Logical reasoning error

---

### Correct Solution (Step-by-Step):

#### Step 1: Determine the total space available for planting flowers.
The flower bed is 132 meters long.

#### Step 2: Calculate the space required for each plant.
Each plant is 3 meters wide, and the problem states that the 12 meters of spacing includes the plant's width. Therefore, the actual spacing between plants is:
\[
12 - 3 = 9 \, \text{meters}.
\]
The total space required for one plant, including the spacing, is:
\[
3 + 9 = 12 \, \text{meters}.
\]

#### Step 3: Find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed.
To find the number of plants that can fit, divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:
\[
132 \div 12 = 11.
\]
So, **11 plants** can fit in the flower bed.

#### Step 4: Determine how many plants Olga needs to buy.
Olga already owns 7 flowers. She needs 11 flowers in total. The number of flowers she needs to buy is:
\[
11 - 7 = 4.
\]

#### Step 5: Calculate the cost of the flowers Olga needs to buy.
Each flowering plant costs ₣9. Since Olga needs to buy 4 plants, the total cost before any discount is:
\[
4 \times 9 = ₣36.
\]

#### Step 6: Check if Olga qualifies for a discount.
The discount applies if Olga buys more than 2 plants. Since she is buying 4 plants, she qualifies for the ₣5 discount. Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[
36 - 5 = ₣31.
\]

#### Step 7: Final cost.
The total amount Olga will spend at the store is:
\[
\boxed{₣31}.
\]

---

### Instructions for Solving This Problem in the Future:

1. **Understand the problem statement carefully.**  
   Pay close attention to details, such as whether spacing includes or excludes the plant's width.

2. **Calculate the total space required for each plant.**  
   Add the plant's width to the spacing between plants. If the spacing already includes the plant's width, adjust accordingly.

3. **Determine how many plants can fit in the flower bed.**  
   Divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant. Round down to the nearest whole number if necessary.

4. **Calculate how many plants need to be purchased.**  
   Subtract the number of plants already owned from the total number of plants required.

5. **Calculate the total cost of the plants.**  
   Multiply the number of plants to be purchased by the cost per plant.

6. **Check for discounts.**  
   Determine if the purchase qualifies for any discounts and apply them to the total cost.

7. **Double-check all calculations.**  
   Verify each step to ensure there are no errors in reasoning or arithmetic.

[Example Input]  
Question: A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. The farmer wants to plant trees along the perimeter of the field, leaving 10 meters of space between each tree. The farmer already has 5 trees. Each tree costs $15 at the store, but if the farmer buys more than 10 trees, they will receive a $20 discount on the total purchase. How much money will the farmer spend at the store to plant the trees?  

Wrong answer:  
The perimeter of the field is \(120 + 80 = 200\) meters. Dividing \(200\) by \(10\), the farmer needs \(20\) trees. Since the farmer already has \(5\), they need to buy \(20 - 5 = 15\) trees. Each tree costs $15, so the total cost is \(15 \times 15 = 225\). The farmer gets a $20 discount, so the final cost is \(225 - 20 = 205\).  

Correct answer:  
The perimeter of the field is \(2 \times (120 + 80) = 400\) meters. Dividing \(400\) by \(10\), the farmer needs \(40\) trees. Since the farmer already has \(5\), they need to buy \(40 - 5 = 35\) trees. Each tree costs $15, so the total cost is \(35 \times 15 = 525\). The farmer gets a $20 discount, so the final cost is \(525 - 20 = 505\).  

---  

[Example Output]  

**Explanation:**  
I miscalculated the perimeter of the field by only adding the length and width instead of using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle. This led to an incorrect number of trees needed. Additionally, I failed to double-check my calculations for the total cost.  

**Error Keywords:**  
- Misinterpretation of problem constraints  
- Miscalculation of geometric properties (perimeter)  
- Incorrect arithmetic  

**Solution:**  
1. Calculate the perimeter of the field: \(2 \times (120 + 80) = 400\) meters.  
2. Determine the number of trees needed: \(400 \div 10 = 40\).  
3. Subtract the number of trees the farmer already has: \(40 - 5 = 35\).  
4. Calculate the total cost of the trees: \(35 \times 15 = 525\).  
5. Apply the discount: \(525 - 20 = 505\).  
6. Final cost: $505.  

**Instructions:**  
1. Carefully read the problem and identify all constraints (e.g., spacing, existing items, discounts).  
2. Use the correct formula for geometric properties (e.g., perimeter, area).  
3. Subtract any existing items from the total needed.  
4. Multiply the remaining quantity by the unit cost.  
5. Apply any discounts or additional conditions to the total cost.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Olga has a flower bed that is 132 meters long. Olga wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Olga's flowers grow 3meters wide so she needs to leave 12 meters between every plant (including the plants width). Olga already owns 7 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ₣9 at the store. However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 9.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","**Reflection on Incorrect Answer:**

1. **Explanation of Error:**  
   My initial answer of ""9.0"" was incorrect because it failed to address the actual problem. I likely misinterpreted the question or skipped key steps in the solution process. Specifically, I did not calculate the number of plants needed, account for the spacing between plants, or apply the cost and discount conditions. This suggests a failure to fully understand the problem and a lack of systematic problem-solving.

2. **Error Keywords:**  
   - Misinterpretation of problem constraints  
   - Failure to account for spacing and total length  
   - Incorrect or incomplete arithmetic  
   - Failure to apply discounts  

---

**Correct Solution (Step-by-Step):**

1. **Understand the Problem:**  
   Olga has a flower bed that is 132 meters long. Each plant takes up 3 meters of width, and there must be 12 meters of space between the centers of each plant (including the plant's width). Olga already owns 7 plants, and each additional plant costs ₣9. If she buys more than 2 plants, she gets a ₣5 discount.

2. **Calculate the Total Number of Plants Needed:**  
   - The total spacing between plants is 12 meters, which includes the 3-meter width of each plant.  
   - To determine how many plants fit in the 132-meter flower bed, we divide the total length by the spacing:  
     \[
     \text{Number of plants needed} = \frac{132}{12} = 11
     \]  
   - Olga needs 11 plants in total.

3. **Determine How Many Plants Olga Needs to Buy:**  
   - Olga already owns 7 plants.  
   - The number of plants she needs to buy is:  
     \[
     11 - 7 = 4
     \]  

4. **Calculate the Total Cost of the Plants:**  
   - Each plant costs ₣9.  
   - The cost of 4 plants is:  
     \[
     4 \times 9 = 36
     \]  

5. **Apply the Discount:**  
   - Since Olga is buying more than 2 plants, she qualifies for a ₣5 discount.  
   - The final cost is:  
     \[
     36 - 5 = 31
     \]  

6. **Final Answer:**  
   Olga will spend **₣31** at the store.

[Example Input]  
Question: A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. The farmer wants to plant trees along the perimeter of the field, leaving 10 meters of space between each tree. The farmer already has 5 trees. Each tree costs $15 at the store, but if the farmer buys more than 10 trees, they will receive a $20 discount on the total purchase. How much money will the farmer spend at the store to plant the trees?  

Wrong answer:  
The perimeter of the field is \(120 + 80 = 200\) meters. Dividing \(200\) by \(10\), the farmer needs \(20\) trees. Since the farmer already has \(5\), they need to buy \(20 - 5 = 15\) trees. Each tree costs $15, so the total cost is \(15 \times 15 = 225\). The farmer gets a $20 discount, so the final cost is \(225 - 20 = 205\).  

Correct answer:  
The perimeter of the field is \(2 \times (120 + 80) = 400\) meters. Dividing \(400\) by \(10\), the farmer needs \(40\) trees. Since the farmer already has \(5\), they need to buy \(40 - 5 = 35\) trees. Each tree costs $15, so the total cost is \(35 \times 15 = 525\). The farmer gets a $20 discount, so the final cost is \(525 - 20 = 505\).  

---  

[Example Output]  

**Explanation:**  
I miscalculated the perimeter of the field by only adding the length and width instead of using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle. This led to an incorrect number of trees needed. Additionally, I failed to double-check my calculations for the total cost.  

**Error Keywords:**  
- Misinterpretation of problem constraints  
- Miscalculation of geometric properties (perimeter)  
- Incorrect arithmetic  

**Solution:**  
1. Calculate the perimeter of the field: \(2 \times (120 + 80) = 400\) meters.  
2. Determine the number of trees needed: \(400 \div 10 = 40\).  
3. Subtract the number of trees the farmer already has: \(40 - 5 = 35\).  
4. Calculate the total cost of the trees: \(35 \times 15 = 525\).  
5. Apply the discount: \(525 - 20 = 505\).  
6. Final cost: $505.  

**Instructions:**  
1. Carefully read the problem and identify all constraints (e.g., spacing, existing items, discounts).  
2. Use the correct formula for geometric properties (e.g., perimeter, area).  
3. Subtract any existing items from the total needed.  
4. Multiply the remaining quantity by the unit cost.  
5. Apply any discounts or additional conditions to the total cost.  
6. Double-check all calculations for accuracy.  

**Advice:**  
- Always verify that you are using the correct formula for geometric properties.  
- Break the problem into smaller steps and solve each step systematically.  
- Pay close attention to constraints and conditions, such as discounts or existing items.  
- Double-check your calculations, especially when multiple steps are involved.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,Olga can peel 6 clams a minute and saute 30 clams in 19 minutes. How many minutes will it take her to peel and saute 150 clams if it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam before peeling it? Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.,163.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Olga will take to wash, peel, and sauté 150 clams, including her break. Let's break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Time to wash the clams
Olga takes **12 seconds** to wash each clam. For 150 clams, the total washing time is:

\[
\text{Washing time} = 150 \times 12 \, \text{seconds}
\]

Convert seconds to minutes (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

\[
\text{Washing time} = \frac{150 \times 12}{60} = 30 \, \text{minutes}
\]

So, it takes **30 minutes** to wash all the clams.

---

### Step 2: Time to peel the clams
Olga can peel **6 clams per minute**. For 150 clams, the total peeling time is:

\[
\text{Peeling time} = \frac{150}{6} = 25 \, \text{minutes}
\]

So, it takes **25 minutes** to peel all the clams.

---

### Step 3: Break time
After peeling the clams, Olga takes a **13-minute break** before she can start sautéing. This adds **13 minutes** to the total time.

---

### Step 4: Time to sauté the clams
Olga can sauté **30 clams in 19 minutes**. For 150 clams, we calculate the total sautéing time as follows:

\[
\text{Sautéing time} = \frac{150}{30} \times 19 = 5 \times 19 = 95 \, \text{minutes}
\]

So, it takes **95 minutes** to sauté all the clams.

---

### Step 5: Total time
Now, we add up all the times:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Washing time} + \text{Peeling time} + \text{Break time} + \text{Sautéing time}
\]

\[
\text{Total time} = 30 + 25 + 13 + 95 = 163 \, \text{minutes}
\]

---

### Final Answer:
It will take Olga **163 minutes** to wash, peel, and sauté 150 clams.",150.0,0,"Olga needs to peel, wash, and sauté 150 clams. Let's break this problem into steps and calculate the total time required.

  1800 \div 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}.
  \]
So, it takes **30 minutes** to wash all the clams.

---

### Step 2: Time to peel the clams
- Olga can peel **6 clams per minute**.
- There are **150 clams** to peel.
- The total time to peel all the clams is:
  \[
  150 \div 6 = 25 \text{ minutes}.
  \]
So, it takes **25 minutes** to peel all the clams.

---

### Step 3: Break time after peeling
- Olga needs to take a **13-minute break** after peeling the clams.
- Add this break time to the total.

---

### Step 4: Time to sauté the clams
- Olga can sauté **30 clams in 19 minutes**.
- There are **150 clams** to sauté.
- The total time to sauté all the clams is:
  \[
  150 \div 30 = 5 \text{ batches}.
  \]
- Each batch takes **19 minutes**, so the total time to sauté all the clams is:
  \[
  5 \times 19 = 95 \text{ minutes}.
  \]
So, it takes **95 minutes** to sauté all the clams.

---

### Step 5: Add up all the times

On Tuesday, he picks half the amount of what he picked in the past 3 days combined. On Wednesday, Andre is going to sell pineapples in boxes of 21 pineapples each. He is going to sell each box for $8. How much is Andre going to make?",408.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the number of pineapples Andre picked on Monday.
On Monday, Andre picks **double** the number of pineapples he picked on Saturday.  
On Saturday, he picked 177 pineapples.  
So, on Monday:  
\[
177 \times 2 = 354 \text{ pineapples.}
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of pineapples picked in the first 3 days (Saturday, Sunday, and Monday).
On Saturday, Andre picked 177 pineapples.  
On Sunday, he picked 183 pineapples.  
On Monday, he picked 354 pineapples.  
Adding these together:  
\[
177 + 183 + 354 = 714 \text{ pineapples.}
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the number of pineapples Andre picked on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, Andre picks **half** the amount of what he picked in the past 3 days combined.  
From Step 2, the total for the first 3 days is 714 pineapples.  
So, on Tuesday:  
\[
\frac{714}{2} = 357 \text{ pineapples.}
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of pineapples Andre picked in all 4 days.
Now, we add up the pineapples picked on all 4 days:  
- Saturday: 177  
- Sunday: 183  
- Monday: 354  
- Tuesday: 357  

Adding these together:  
\[
177 + 183 + 354 + 357 = 1,071 \text{ pineapples.}
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate how many boxes of pineapples Andre can sell.
Each box contains 21 pineapples.  
To find the number of boxes Andre can sell, divide the total number of pineapples by 21:  
\[
\frac{1,071}{21} = 51 \text{ boxes.}
\]

---

### Step 6: Calculate how much money Andre will make.
Andre sells each box for $8.  
If he sells 51 boxes, the total amount of money he will make is:  
\[
51 \times 8 = 408 \text{ dollars.}
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Andre is going to make **$408**.",408.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Pineapples picked on Saturday**:  
   Andre picks 177 pineapples on Saturday.

2. **Pineapples picked on Sunday**:  
   Andre picks 183 pineapples on Sunday.

3. **Pineapples picked on Monday**:  
   On Monday, Andre picks double the number of pineapples he did on Saturday.  
   So, the number of pineapples picked on Monday is 2 * 177 = 354.

4. **Total pineapples picked in the first 3 days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday)**:  
   Total = 177 (Saturday) + 183 (Sunday) + 354 (Monday) = 714.

5. **Pineapples picked on Tuesday**:  
   On Tuesday, Andre picks half the amount of what he picked in the past 3 days combined.  
   Half of 714 is 714 / 2 = 357.  
   So, Andre picks 357 pineapples on Tuesday.

6. **Total pineapples picked in 4 days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday)**:  
   Total = 714 (first 3 days) + 357 (Tuesday) = 1071.

7. **Number of boxes Andre can sell**:  
   Each box contains 21 pineapples.  
   The number of boxes Andre can sell is 1071 / 21 = 51 (since 1071 is divisible by 21).

8. **Money earned per box**:  
   Andre sells each box for $8.  
   So, the total money Andre makes is 51 * 8 = $408.

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 50% for the second half. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?",1755.0,"To solve this problem, we will calculate the total number of pizzas consumed by the family over the two months step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the daily pizza consumption for the family**
- The uncle eats **10 pizzas per day**.
- The spouse eats **20 pizzas per day**.
- Together, they eat \( 10 + 20 = 30 \) pizzas per day.
- The grandchild eats **two-fourths (or half)** of the combined number of pizzas they eat per day:
  \[
  \text{Grandchild's daily consumption} = \frac{2}{4} \times 30 = 15 \text{ pizzas per day}.
  \]
- Total daily consumption for the family:
  \[
  10 + 20 + 15 = 45 \text{ pizzas per day}.
  \]

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the total pizzas consumed in the first month**
- There are 30 days in the first month.
- Total pizzas consumed in the first month:
  \[
  45 \times 30 = 1350 \text{ pizzas}.
  \]

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the daily pizza consumption in the second month**
In the second month, the family reduces their consumption:
1. **First half of the month (15 days):**
   - They reduce their consumption by **60%**, so they eat only **40%** of their usual daily amount.
   - Daily consumption during this period:
     \[
     45 \times 0.4 = 18 \text{ pizzas per day}.
     \]
   - Total pizzas consumed in the first half of the second month:
     \[
     18 \times 15 = 270 \text{ pizzas}.
     \]

2. **Second half of the month (15 days):**
   - They reduce their consumption by an **additional 50%**, so they eat only **50%** of the reduced amount from the first half of the month.
   - Daily consumption during this period:
     \[
     18 \times 0.5 = 9 \text{ pizzas per day}.
     \]
   - Total pizzas consumed in the second half of the second month:
     \[
     9 \times 15 = 135 \text{ pizzas}.

---

### **Final Answer:**
The family eats **1755 pizzas** in two months.",1755.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten per day by the family.
- The uncle eats 10 pizzas per day.
- The spouse eats 20 pizzas per day.
- Together, they eat \( 10 + 20 = 30 \) pizzas per day.
- The grandchild eats two-fourths (or half) of the combined number of pizzas they eat per day. So, the grandchild eats \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) pizzas per day.
- Therefore, the total number of pizzas eaten by the family per day is:
  \[
  30 + 15 = 45 \text{ pizzas per day.}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten in the first month.
- There are 30 days in the first month.
- The family eats 45 pizzas per day.
- So, the total number of pizzas eaten in the first month is:
  \[

- This means they eat only \( 100\% - 60\% = 40\% \) of their usual daily consumption.
- \( 40\% \) of 45 pizzas is:
  \[
  0.4 \times 45 = 18 \text{ pizzas per day.}
  \]
- There are 15 days in the first half of the month.
- So, the total number of pizzas eaten in the first half of the second month is:
  \[
  18 \times 15 = 270 \text{ pizzas.}
  \]

#### Second half of the second month:
- The family reduces their food consumption by an additional 50%.
- This means they eat only \( 50\% \) of the 40% they were eating in the first half of the month.
- \( 50\% \) of 40% is:
  \[
  0.5 \times 0.4 = 0.2 \text{ (or 20\%) of their usual daily consumption.}
  \]
- \( 20\% \) of 45 pizzas is:
  \[
  0.2 \times 45 = 9 \text{ pizzas per day.}
  \]
- There are 15 days in the second half of the month.
- So, the total number of pizzas eaten in the second half of the second month is:
  \[
  9 \times 15 = 135 \text{ pizzas.}
  \]

#### Total for the second month:
- The total number of pizzas eaten in the second month is:
  \[
  270 + 135 = 405 \text{ pizzas.}
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten in two months.
- The total number of pizzas eaten in the first month is 1350.
- The total number of pizzas eaten in the second month is 405.
- So, the total number of pizzas eaten in two months is:
  \[
  1350 + 405 = 1755 \text{ pizzas.}

After accounting for the 700 seats for graduate, 450 seats for the faculty attending, and reserving 50 seats for the event's staff, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?",12.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tickets each graduate will receive for their friends and family. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Total seating capacity
The Sports Arena has a total seating capacity of **9600 people**.

### Step 2: Subtract reserved seats
We need to subtract the seats reserved for graduates, faculty, and event staff:
- Seats for graduates: **700**
- Seats for faculty: **450**
- Seats for event staff: **50**

The total reserved seats are:
\[
700 + 450 + 50 = 1200
\]

Now, subtract the reserved seats from the total seating capacity:
\[
9600 - 1200 = 8400
\]

This means there are **8400 seats available** for friends and family.

### Step 3: Determine the number of graduates
There are **700 graduates**.

### Step 4: Divide the available seats equally among the graduates
Each graduate will receive an equal number of tickets for their friends and family. To find this, divide the available seats by the number of graduates:
\[
\frac{8400}{700} = 12
\]

### Final Answer:
Each graduate will receive **12 tickets** to give to their friends and family.",12.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The Sports Arena has space for 9600 people in total.

First, we account for the seats reserved for graduates, faculty, and staff:
- There are 700 seats for graduates.
- There are 450 seats for faculty.
- There are 50 seats for the event's staff.

The total reserved seats are:
700 + 450 + 50 = 1200 seats.

Now, we subtract the reserved seats from the total capacity of the arena to find the number of seats available for friends and family:
9600 - 1200 = 8400 seats.

Next, we need to determine how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family. Since there are 700 graduates, the 8400 available seats will be split equally among them:
8400 ÷ 700 = 12 tickets per graduate.

How many emails does Mohammed respond to in a 6 day work week? Mohammed work overtime on the last day so he can respond to 10% more emails than usual.",61.0,"Let's break this problem into smaller steps and solve it step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the number of emails that don't require a response.
Mohammed receives **30 emails a day**, and **20% of those emails don't require a response**.

\[
\text{Emails that don't require a response per day} = 20\% \times 30 = 0.2 \times 30 = 6
\]

So, **6 emails per day don't require a response**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the number of emails that require a response.
The remaining emails **do require a response**. Subtract the emails that don't require a response from the total emails:

\[
\text{Emails that require a response per day} = 30 - 6 = 24
\]

So, **24 emails per day require a response**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate how many emails Mohammed can respond to on a normal day.
Mohammed can only respond to **2 less than half** of the emails that require a response. First, calculate half of the emails that require a response:

\[
\text{Half of the emails that require a response} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12
\]

Now subtract 2 from this:

\[
\text{Emails Mohammed responds to per day} = 12 - 2 = 10
\]

So, Mohammed responds to **10 emails per day** on a normal day.

---

### Step 4: Calculate how many emails Mohammed responds to in a 6-day work week.
For the first **5 days**, Mohammed responds to **10 emails per day**:

\[
\text{Emails responded to in 5 days} = 10 \times 5 = 50
\]

On the **6th day**, Mohammed works overtime and responds to **10% more emails than usual**. First, calculate 10% of the usual number of emails he responds to:

\[
\text{10% of 10 emails} = 0.1 \times 10 = 1
\]

Now add this to the usual number of emails he responds to:

\[
\text{Emails responded to on the 6th day} = 10 + 1 = 11
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of emails Mohammed responds to in the 6-day work week.
Add the emails responded to in the first 5 days and the 6th day:

\[
\text{Total emails responded to in 6 days} = 50 + 11 = 61
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Mohammed responds to **61 emails** in a 6-day work week.",6.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Mohammed receives 30 emails a day.
   - 20% of those emails don't require any response.
   - To find the number of emails that don't require a response, calculate 20% of 30:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 6
     \]
   - So, 6 emails don't require a response.

2. The remaining emails require a response:
   \[
   30 - 6 = 24
   \]
   - So, 24 emails require a response.

3. Mohammed can only respond to 2 less than half of the emails that require a response:
   - First, find half of 24:
     \[
     \frac{24}{2} = 12
     \]
   - Then subtract 2:
     \[
     12 - 2 = 10
     \]
   - So, Mohammed responds to 10 emails per day under normal circumstances.

4. Mohammed works a 6-day work week. For the first 5 days, he responds to 10 emails per day:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50
   \]
   - So, he responds to 50 emails in the first 5 days.

5. On the 6th day, Mohammed works overtime and can respond to 10% more emails than usual:
   - To find 10% more than 10 emails, calculate 10% of 10:
     \[
     10\% \text{ of } 10 = \frac{10}{100} \times 10 = 1
     \]
   - Add this to the usual 10 emails:
     \[
     10 + 1 = 11
     \]
   - So, on the 6th day, Mohammed responds to 11 emails.

6. Add the emails he responds to over the 6 days:

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Ananya walks 24 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 miles of walking on the beach and 14 miles of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?",85.0,"We are tasked with finding the total time Ananya takes to complete her 24-mile walk, given the details about her walking speeds and times. Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define variables
Let Ananya's original walking speed on the beach (before her injury) be \( x \) miles per minute.  
Then, her original walking speed on the sidewalk is \( 2x \) miles per minute (since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk).  

Due to her injury, her walking speed is halved:
- Her new speed on the beach is \( \frac{x}{2} \) miles per minute.
- Her new speed on the sidewalk is \( x \) miles per minute.

---

### Step 2: Use the given time spent on the beach
We are told that Ananya spends **50 minutes walking on the beach**. Using the formula for distance (\( \text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \)), the distance she covers on the beach is:
\[
\text{Distance on beach} = \text{Speed on beach} \times \text{Time on beach}.
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
10 = \frac{x}{2} \times 50.
\]
Solve for \( x \):
\[
10 = 25x \quad \implies \quad x = \frac{10}{25} = \frac{2}{5}.
\]
Thus, Ananya's original walking speed on the beach was \( \frac{2}{5} \) miles per minute.

---

### Step 3: Determine her new walking speeds
- Her new speed on the beach is:
\[
\frac{x}{2} = \frac{\frac{2}{5}}{2} = \frac{1}{5} \text{ miles per minute}.
\]
- Her new speed on the sidewalk is:
\[
x = \frac{2}{5} \text{ miles per minute}.
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk
The total distance Ananya walks on the sidewalk is 14 miles. Using the formula for time (\( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \)), the time she spends on the sidewalk is:
\[
\text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on sidewalk}}.
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{14}{\frac{2}{5}} = 14 \times \frac{5}{2} = 35 \text{ minutes}.
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the total time
The total time Ananya spends walking is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk}.
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Total time} = 50 + 35 = 85 \text{ minutes}.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
Ananya takes **85 minutes** to complete her 24-mile walk.",24.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Understand the problem**:  
   Ananya walks 24 miles in total every day, which includes:
   - 10 miles on the beach.
   - 14 miles on the sidewalk.  
   On the sidewalk, her speed is **twice** her speed on the beach.  
   Due to an injury, her speed is reduced to **half** of her usual speed on both the beach and the sidewalk.  
   We are told that she spends **50 minutes walking on the beach**, and we need to calculate the total time it takes for her to complete the 24-mile walk.

---

2. **Define variables**:  
   Let Ananya's original speed on the beach (before the injury) be \( x \) miles per minute.  
   - Her original speed on the sidewalk is \( 2x \) miles per minute (twice her beach speed).  
   - After the injury, her speed on the beach is reduced to \( \frac{x}{2} \) miles per minute.  
   - After the injury, her speed on the sidewalk is reduced to \( \frac{2x}{2} = x \) miles per minute.

---

3. **Use the given information about the beach**:  
   Ananya spends **50 minutes walking on the beach**.  
   - Her speed on the beach after the injury is \( \frac{x}{2} \) miles per minute.  
   - The distance she walks on the beach is 10 miles.  
   Using the formula for time:  
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   50 = \frac{10}{\frac{x}{2}}
   \]  
   Simplify:  
   \[
   50 = \frac{10 \cdot 2}{x}
   \]  
   \[
   50 = \frac{20}{x}
   \]  
   Solve for \( x \):  
   \[
   x = \frac{20}{50} = 0.4
   \]  
   So, Ananya's **original speed on the beach** is \( x = 0.4 \) miles per minute.

---

4. **Find her speeds after the injury**:  
   - Her speed on the beach after the injury is \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{0.4}{2} = 0.2 \) miles per minute.  
   - Her speed on the sidewalk after the injury is \( x = 0.4 \) miles per minute.

---

5. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk**:  
   The distance Ananya walks on the sidewalk is 14 miles.  
   Her speed on the sidewalk after the injury is \( 0.4 \) miles per minute.  
   Using the formula for time:  
   \[
   \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{14}{0.4} = 35 \, \text{minutes}.
   \]

---

6. **Find the total time for the walk**:  
   - Time spent on the beach = 50 minutes.  
   - Time spent on the sidewalk = 35 minutes.  
   Total time:  
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 50 + 35 = 85 \, \text{minutes}.

How many cookies are still hidden in the yard?",64.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the total number of cookies Amelia initially had.
Amelia initially had **11 dozen cookies**. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies:
\[
11 \times 12 = 132 \text{ cookies.}
\]

---

### Step 2: Subtract the cookies Amelia ate for breakfast.
Amelia ate **5 cookies** for breakfast, so the remaining number of cookies is:
\[
132 - 5 = 127 \text{ cookies.}
\]

---

### Step 3: Track how many cookies each person finds.

#### Elena:
Elena finds **5 cookies**.

#### Mei:
Mei finds **twice as many as Elena**:
\[
2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cookies.}
\]

#### Xavier:
Xavier finds **2 less than Mei**:
\[
10 - 2 = 8 \text{ cookies.}
\]

#### Mohammed:
Mohammed finds **one-eighth as many as Xavier**:
\[
\frac{8}{8} = 1 \text{ cookie.}
\]

#### Umar:
Umar finds **two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined**. First, calculate how many cookies Mei and Elena found together:
\[
10 + 5 = 15 \text{ cookies.}
\]
Two dozen cookies is:
\[
2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ cookies.}
\]
So Umar finds:
\[
15 + 24 = 39 \text{ cookies.}
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of cookies found.
Add up the cookies found by all five people:
\[
5 \text{ (Elena)} + 10 \text{ (Mei)} + 8 \text{ (Xavier)} + 1 \text{ (Mohammed)} + 39 \text{ (Umar)} = 63 \text{ cookies.}
\]

---

### Step 5: Subtract the cookies found from the total remaining cookies.
Initially, there were **127 cookies** after Amelia ate breakfast. Subtract the **63 cookies** that were found:
\[
127 - 63 = 64 \text{ cookies.}
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The number of cookies still hidden in the yard is:
\[
\boxed{64 \text{ cookies.}}
\]",64.0,1,"Amelia initially had 11 dozen cookies.  
- A dozen is 12, so 11 dozen cookies equals \( 11 \times 12 = 132 \) cookies.  
Amelia ate 5 cookies for breakfast.  
- The remaining cookies are \( 132 - 5 = 127 \).  

Now, Amelia hid the remaining 127 cookies in the yard.  
Elena finds 5 cookies.  
- Mei finds twice as many as Elena, so Mei finds \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) cookies.  
- Xavier finds 2 less than Mei, so Xavier finds \( 10 - 2 = 8 \) cookies.  
- Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier, so Mohammed finds \( \frac{8}{8} = 1 \) cookie.  
- Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined.  
  - Mei and Elena combined find \( 10 + 5 = 15 \) cookies.  
  - Two dozen is \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \), so Umar finds \( 15 + 24 = 39 \) cookies.  

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies found:  
- Elena finds 5 cookies.  
- Mei finds 10 cookies.  
- Xavier finds 8 cookies.  
- Mohammed finds 1 cookie.  
- Umar finds 39 cookies.  
The total number of cookies found is \( 5 + 10 + 8 + 1 + 39 = 63 \).  

Finally, the number of cookies still hidden in the yard is:  
- Total cookies hidden initially: 127.  
- Total cookies found: 63.  
- Remaining cookies: \( 127 - 63 = 64 \).

However, this week, 9 apartments from each of the first 2 complexes were vacant and did not require collection service. Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each place and he gets paid ₣0.5 per collection for each apartment. He also earns an additional 10% in tips. How much money does he make in a week?",1243.0,"Let's break this problem into smaller steps and solve it step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes.
Each of the first two apartment complexes has 100 apartments. Therefore, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is:

\[
100 + 100 = 200 \text{ apartments.}
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
The third complex is 35% bigger than the total number of apartments in the first two complexes. So, we calculate 35% of 200:

\[
35\% \text{ of } 200 = 0.35 \times 200 = 70.
\]

Thus, the third complex has:

\[
200 + 70 = 270 \text{ apartments.}
\]

---

### Step 3: Adjust for vacant apartments in the first two complexes.
This week, 9 apartments in each of the first two complexes were vacant. So, the number of apartments requiring garbage collection in each of the first two complexes is:

\[
100 - 9 = 91 \text{ apartments.}
\]

The total number of apartments requiring garbage collection in the first two complexes is:

\[
91 + 91 = 182 \text{ apartments.}
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of apartments requiring garbage collection.
The third complex has no mention of vacancies, so all 270 apartments require garbage collection. Adding this to the adjusted total for the first two complexes:

\[
182 + 270 = 452 \text{ apartments.}
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of collections in a week.
Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections in a week is:

\[
452 \times 5 = 2,260 \text{ collections.}
\]

---

### Step 6: Calculate Oscar's earnings from collections.
Oscar earns ₣0.5 per collection. So, his earnings from collections are:

\[
2,260 \times 0.5 = ₣1,130.
\]

---

### Step 7: Calculate Oscar's tips.
Oscar earns an additional 10% in tips. To calculate the tips, we find 10% of ₣1,130:

\[
10\% \text{ of } 1,130 = 0.1 \times 1,130 = ₣113.
\]

---

### Step 8: Calculate Oscar's total earnings.
Adding the tips to his earnings from collections, Oscar's total earnings for the week are:

\[
₣1,130 + ₣113 = ₣1,243.

Each of the first two complexes has 100 apartments. So, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is:
\[
100 + 100 = 200 \text{ apartments.}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
The third complex is 35% bigger than the first two combined. So, the size of the third complex is:
\[
200 + (35\% \text{ of } 200) = 200 + 0.35 \times 200 = 200 + 70 = 270 \text{ apartments.}
\]

### Step 3: Account for the vacant apartments in the first two complexes.
This week, 9 apartments in each of the first two complexes were vacant. So, the number of apartments requiring garbage collection in the first two complexes is:
\[
100 - 9 = 91 \text{ apartments per complex.}
\]
For both complexes combined:
\[
91 + 91 = 182 \text{ apartments.}
\]

### Step 4: Total number of apartments requiring garbage collection.
Adding the third complex (which has no vacancies) to the first two complexes:
\[
182 + 270 = 452 \text{ apartments.}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total collections in a week.
Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each apartment. So, the total number of collections in a week is:
\[
452 \times 5 = 2260 \text{ collections.}

---

### Step 1: Understand the pricing structure
1. **First 10 minutes**: ₺0.8 per minute.
2. **Next 30 minutes (from 11 to 40 minutes)**: ₺0.7 per minute.
3. **After 40 minutes (from 41 to 60 minutes)**: ₺0.1 per 2 minutes, which is equivalent to ₺0.05 per minute.

   - The cost for the first 10 minutes is:  
     \( 10 \times 0.8 = ₺8.0 \).

2. **For the next 30 minutes (from minute 11 to minute 40)**, the cost is ₺0.7 per minute.
   - The cost for these 30 minutes is:  
     \( 30 \times 0.7 = ₺21.0 \).

3. **For the remaining 20 minutes (from minute 41 to minute 60)**, the cost is ₺0.1 per two minutes.  
   - The number of two-minute intervals in 20 minutes is:  
     \( 20 \div 2 = 10 \) intervals.  
   - The cost for these 10 intervals is:  
     \( 10 \times 0.1 = ₺1.0 \).

4. **Add up the total cost before any discount**:  
   - Total cost = ₺8.0 + ₺21.0 + ₺1.0 = ₺30.0.

5. **Check if the total bill qualifies for a discount**:  
   - Since the total bill (₺30.0) is more than ₺25, a 20% discount applies.  
   - The discount amount is:  
     \( 30.0 \times 0.2 = ₺6.0 \).  
   - The final cost after the discount is:

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"A janitor has to clean a building with 200 rooms. They have 10 days to get it done. It takes them 6 minutes per room. However, due to a recent injury, the janitor has become slower and it will take them twice as long to clean a room these days. If they work for 8 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?",50.0,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine how long it takes the janitor to clean one room now.
The janitor used to take **6 minutes per room**, but now it takes them **twice as long** due to the injury. So:

\[
\text{Time per room} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \, \text{minutes per room}.
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total time required to clean all 200 rooms.
If it takes **12 minutes per room** and there are **200 rooms**, the total time required is:

\[
\text{Total time} = 200 \times 12 = 2400 \, \text{minutes}.
\]

---

### Step 3: Determine how many minutes the janitor works per day.
The janitor works **8 hours per day**, and there are **60 minutes in an hour**. So:

\[
\text{Minutes per day} = 8 \times 60 = 480 \, \text{minutes per day}.
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of minutes worked over 10 days.
The janitor works for **10 days**, and each day they work **480 minutes**. So:

\[
\text{Total minutes worked over 10 days} = 10 \times 480 = 4800 \, \text{minutes}.
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the percentage of time spent cleaning rooms.
The janitor spends **2400 minutes cleaning rooms** out of the total **4800 minutes worked**. To find the percentage of time spent cleaning rooms:

\[
\text{Percentage of time spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total time worked}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Percentage of time spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{2400}{4800} \right) \times 100 = 50\%.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The janitor spends **50% of their day, on average, cleaning rooms**.",50.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The janitor has 200 rooms to clean, and it originally took them 6 minutes per room. However, due to the injury, it now takes them **twice as long**, which means it takes **6 × 2 = 12 minutes per room**.

### Step 1: Total time required to clean all rooms
If it takes 12 minutes per room and there are 200 rooms, the total time required to clean all the rooms is:
\[
200 \times 12 = 2400 \text{ minutes}.
\]

### Step 2: Total time available in 10 days
The janitor works 8 hours a day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time available per day is:
\[
8 \times 60 = 480 \text{ minutes per day}.
\]
Over 10 days, the total time available is:
\[
480 \times 10 = 4800 \text{ minutes}.
\]

### Step 3: Average time spent cleaning per day
The janitor needs 2400 minutes to clean all the rooms. Over 10 days, the average time spent cleaning per day is:
\[
\frac{2400}{10} = 240 \text{ minutes per day}.
\]

### Step 4: Percentage of the day spent cleaning
The janitor works 480 minutes per day. The percentage of their day spent cleaning is:
\[
\frac{240}{480} \times 100 = 50\%.

As the skillet of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 70 pop in the first 10 seconds of cooking, then 2 times that amount in the next 10 seconds. The kernels increase to 4 times the initial popping rate in the next 10 seconds. In the final 10 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 10 seconds. After Noah takes the skillet off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. Noah gives one-fifth of the made popcorn to his brother Luca. How many more pieces of popcorn does Noah have to eat than his brother?",399.0,"Let's break this problem into steps to calculate how many pieces of popcorn Noah has to eat compared to his brother Luca.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the number of kernels that pop in each 10-second interval.

#### First 10 seconds:
The problem states that **70 kernels pop** in the first 10 seconds.

#### Second 10 seconds:
The popping rate doubles, so:
\[
70 \times 2 = 140 \text{ kernels.}
\]

#### Third 10 seconds:
The popping rate increases to **4 times the initial rate**, so:
\[
70 \times 4 = 280 \text{ kernels.}
\]

#### Fourth 10 seconds:
The popping slows down to **half the rate of the previous 10 seconds**. In the third 10 seconds, 280 kernels popped, so:
\[
280 \div 2 = 140 \text{ kernels.}
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the number of kernels that pop after the skillet is removed from the heat.

After the skillet is removed, **a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds** pop due to residual heat. In the final 10 seconds, 140 kernels popped, so:
\[
140 \div 4 = 35 \text{ kernels.}
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of popped kernels.

Add up all the kernels that popped during and after cooking:
\[
70 + 140 + 280 + 140 + 35 = 665 \text{ kernels.}
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate how many kernels Noah gives to Luca.

Noah gives **one-fifth** of the total popcorn to Luca. So:
\[
\frac{665}{5} = 133 \text{ kernels.}
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate how many kernels Noah keeps for himself.

Noah keeps the remaining popcorn:
\[
665 - 133 = 532 \text{ kernels.}
\]

---

### Step 6: Calculate how many more kernels Noah has than Luca.

Noah has **532 kernels**, and Luca has **133 kernels**. The difference is:
\[
532 - 133 = 399 \text{ kernels.}

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"A building is made out of 5 white bricks, twice as many orange bricks, and an unknown number of green bricks. If there are 30 bricks in the building in total, what percentage of bricks are green?",50.0,"We are tasked with finding the percentage of green bricks in a building made of white, orange, and green bricks. Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the variables
- The number of **white bricks** is given as \( 5 \).
- The number of **orange bricks** is **twice as many as white bricks**, so the number of orange bricks is:
  \[
  2 \times 5 = 10
  \]
- Let the number of **green bricks** be \( x \).

The total number of bricks in the building is \( 30 \).

---

### Step 2: Write an equation for the total number of bricks
The total number of bricks is the sum of white, orange, and green bricks:
\[
5 + 10 + x = 30
\]

---

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Simplify the equation:
\[
15 + x = 30
\]

Subtract \( 15 \) from both sides:
\[
x = 15
\]

So, there are \( 15 \) green bricks.

---

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage of green bricks
The percentage of green bricks is given by:
\[
\text{Percentage of green bricks} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of green bricks}}{\text{Total number of bricks}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Percentage of green bricks} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100
\]

Simplify:
\[
\text{Percentage of green bricks} = 0.5 \times 100 = 50

### Final Answer:
The percentage of green bricks is **50%**.",50.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

The building is made of 5 white bricks, twice as many orange bricks, and an unknown number of green bricks.  
First, calculate the number of orange bricks.  
Twice as many orange bricks as white bricks means:  
Number of orange bricks = 2 * 5 = 10.

Next, calculate the total number of white and orange bricks:  
White bricks + Orange bricks = 5 + 10 = 15.

The total number of bricks in the building is 30.  
So, the number of green bricks is:  
Total bricks - (White bricks + Orange bricks) = 30 - 15 = 15.

Now, calculate the percentage of green bricks.  
The percentage of green bricks is:  
(Number of green bricks / Total number of bricks) * 100 = (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20,"Olivia, Bodhi are currently 24 years apart in age. Olivia and Keisha are currently 15 years apart. Olivia, who is younger than Bodhi but older than Keisha, will be 42 in 7 years. How much younger is Keisha than the average age of all three?",18.0,"We are tasked with determining how much younger Keisha is than the average age of Olivia, Bodhi, and Keisha. Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine Olivia's current age
We are told that Olivia will be 42 in 7 years. To find her current age, subtract 7 from 42:

\[
\text{Olivia's current age} = 42 - 7 = 35
\]

So, Olivia is currently **35 years old**.

---

### Step 2: Determine Bodhi's current age
We are told that Olivia and Bodhi are 24 years apart in age, and Olivia is younger than Bodhi. Therefore, Bodhi's age is:

\[
\text{Bodhi's current age} = \text{Olivia's current age} + 24 = 35 + 24 = 59
\]

So, Bodhi is currently **59 years old**.

---

### Step 3: Determine Keisha's current age
We are told that Olivia and Keisha are 15 years apart in age, and Olivia is older than Keisha. Therefore, Keisha's age is:

\[
\text{Keisha's current age} = \text{Olivia's current age} - 15 = 35 - 15 = 20
\]

So, Keisha is currently **20 years old**.

---

### Step 4: Calculate the average age of all three
The average age of Olivia, Bodhi, and Keisha is the sum of their ages divided by 3. Add their ages:

\[
\text{Sum of ages} = \text{Olivia's age} + \text{Bodhi's age} + \text{Keisha's age} = 35 + 59 + 20 = 114
\]

Now, divide by 3 to find the average:

\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Sum of ages}}{3} = \frac{114}{3} = 38
\]

So, the average age of all three is **38 years**.

---

### Step 5: Determine how much younger Keisha is than the average age
Keisha's age is 20, and the average age is 38. To find how much younger Keisha is, subtract Keisha's age from the average age:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Average age} - \text{Keisha's age} = 38 - 20 = 18
\]

---
