   Total price before discount: $95 + $165 + x = $260 + x.

4. **Calculate the discount amount:** 20% discount on $260 + x = 0.20 * ($260 + x)

5. **Set up the equation:** Total paid ($1500) equals price before discount minus the discount: 
   $1500 = ($260 + x) - 0.20 * ($260 + x)

6. **Solve for x:** 
   $1500 = $260 + x - 52 - 0.2x
   $1500 = $208 + 0.8x
   $1292 = 0.8x
   x = $1615 

7. **Calculate the cost per dozen of mini cheesecakes:** 
   $1615 / 5 dozen = $323/dozen.



**Instructions:**

1. Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts. Identify the costs of individual items separately.
2. Calculate the total price before applying the discount. 
3. Calculate the discount amount accurately. 
4. Set up an equation representing the relationship between the total paid, the original price, and the discount. 
5. Solve the equation for the unknown variable. 

**General Advice:**

- Always double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with discounts and multiple items. 
- Pay attention to units and ensure consistency throughout the calculation. 
- Visualizing the problem with diagrams or lists can be helpful. 
- Practice solving similar problems to improve your understanding and accuracy.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the time to cover the whole city:**

* The fog covers 4 miles in 60 minutes.
* To cover 80 miles, it will take 80 miles / 4 miles/60 minutes = 1200 minutes.

**2. Calculate the time to cover 1/4 of the city:**

* 1/4 of the city is 80 miles * (1/4) = 20 miles.

**3. Calculate the time to cover 20 miles at the initial wind speed:**

*  Since the fog covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, it will take 20 miles / 4 miles/60 minutes = 300 minutes.

**4.  Consider the wind speed change:**

* The wind speed is halved in one hour, which is 60 minutes. 
* This means the fog will travel slower after the first hour.

**5. Determine the time spent at each wind speed:**

* The fog travels for 300 minutes at the initial wind speed.
* The remaining time is 1200 minutes - 300 minutes = 900 minutes.


**6. Calculate the time to cover the remaining distance at the halved wind speed:**

*  We need to figure out how long it takes to cover 20 miles at half the speed.  Since the fog covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, at half the speed it will cover 2 miles in 60 minutes.
*  Therefore, it will take 20 miles / 2 miles/60 minutes = 600 minutes.

**7. Calculate the total time:**

My previous answers were incorrect because I failed to account for the changing wind speed. I treated the fog's speed as constant, which is a crucial mistake in this problem. 

## Error Keywords:

- **Changing Conditions:** The wind speed is not constant.
- **Rate:** The fog's speed is dependent on the wind speed.
- **Time:** The time taken to cover a distance is affected by the rate.

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Calculate the initial fog speed:**
   - The fog covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, so its initial speed is 4 miles / 60 minutes = 1/15 miles per minute.

2. **Calculate the new fog speed:**
   - The wind speed is halved in one hour (60 minutes), so the new speed is (1/15 miles per minute) / 2 = 1/30 miles per minute.

3. **Calculate the time to cover 1/4 of the city:**
   - 1/4 of the city is 80 miles / 4 = 20 miles.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 20 miles / (1/30 miles per minute) = 600 minutes.

However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the time to cover the whole city:**

* The fog covers 4 miles in 60 minutes.
* To cover 80 miles, it will take 80 miles / 4 miles/60 minutes = 1200 minutes.

**2. Calculate the time to cover 1/4 of the city:**

* 1/4 of the city is 80 miles * (1/4) = 20 miles.

**3. Calculate the time to cover 20 miles at the initial wind speed:**

*  Since the fog covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, it will take 20 miles / 4 miles/60 minutes = 300 minutes.

**4.  Consider the wind speed change:**

* The wind speed is halved in one hour, which is 60 minutes. 
* This means the fog will travel slower after the first hour.

**5. Determine the time spent at each wind speed:**

* The fog travels for 300 minutes at the initial wind speed.
* The remaining time is 1200 minutes - 300 minutes = 900 minutes.


**6. Calculate the time to cover the remaining distance at the halved wind speed:**

*  We need to figure out how long it takes to cover 20 miles at half the speed.  Since the fog covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, at half the speed it will cover 2 miles in 60 minutes.
*  Therefore, it will take 20 miles / 2 miles/60 minutes = 600 minutes.

**7. Calculate the total time:**

* The total time is 300 minutes (initial speed) + 600 minutes (halved speed) = 900 minutes.




**Answer:** It will take **900 minutes** for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city.",4.0,0,"A: Let's think step by step:

1. **Calculate the time to cover the whole city:** 
   - The fog covers 4 miles in 60 minutes.
   - The city is 80 miles wide.
   - Time to cover the whole city: (80 miles / 4 miles/60 minutes) = 1200 minutes

2. **Calculate the time to cover 1/4 of the city:**
   - 1/4 of the city is 80 miles / 4 = 20 miles.

3. **Calculate the time to cover 20 miles at the initial wind speed:**
   - Time = (Distance / Speed) 
   - We know the speed is 4 miles every 60 minutes, so the speed is 4/60 miles per minute.
   - Time = 20 miles / (4/60 miles/minute) = 300 minutes

4. **Calculate the wind speed after one hour:**
   - The wind speed is halved in one hour.
   - Initial speed: 4 miles / 60 minutes = 1/15 miles per minute
   - New speed: (1/15 miles/minute) / 2 = 1/30 miles per minute

5. **Calculate the time to cover the remaining 20 miles at the reduced wind speed:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time = 20 miles / (1/30 miles/minute) = 600 minutes

6. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Time for the first 20 miles + Time for the remaining 20 miles
   - Total time = 300 minutes + 600 minutes = 900 minutes

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

**Explanation:**

My previous answers were incorrect because I failed to account for the change in fog bank speed due to the wind. I simply used the initial rate of 4 miles every 60 minutes without considering the impact of the wind speed halving.

**Error Keywords:**

- **Rate:** I didn't correctly adjust the rate of fog movement.
- **Changing Conditions:** I ignored the crucial information about the wind speed changing.
- **Proportionality:** I didn't apply the concept of proportionality to calculate the new rate.

**Corrected Solution:**

1. **Calculate the initial speed:** The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes, so its initial speed is 4 miles / 60 minutes = 1/15 mile per minute.

2. **Calculate the new speed:** The wind speed is halved, so the new speed is (1/15 mile per minute) / 2 = 1/30 mile per minute.

3. **Calculate the distance:** 1/4 of the city is 80 miles / 4 = 20 miles.

4. **Calculate the time:** Time = Distance / Speed. Therefore, it will take 20 miles / (1/30 mile per minute) = 600 minutes for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city.



**Instructions for Future Problems:**

1. **Identify changing conditions:** Carefully read the problem and pinpoint any factors that change over time.
2. **Calculate relevant rates:** Determine the initial and changed rates involved in the problem.
3. **Apply proportionality:** Use the concept of proportionality to relate the initial and changed rates to the new conditions.
4. **Double-check units:** Ensure consistency in units throughout the calculation.

**General Advice:**

- **Read carefully:** Pay close attention to all details and keywords in the problem.
- **Visualize the situation:** Create a mental picture of the scenario to better understand the relationships between variables.
- **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
- **Check your answer:** Ensure your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 15.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answer was incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the total TV time spent each day and then sum them up correctly. I likely made assumptions about the number of 15-minute episodes watched on Thursday without properly considering the time spent on other days.

**Error Keywords:**

- Time Calculation
- Addition
- Misinterpretation

## Solution:

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Tuesday & Wednesday:** 4 hours/episode * 2 episodes/day = 8 hours/day
   Total for Tuesday & Wednesday: 8 hours/day * 2 days = 16 hours

2. **Thursday:** Let 'x' be the number of 15-minute episodes watched.
   Total time on Thursday: x episodes * 15 minutes/episode = 15x minutes
   Convert to hours: 15x minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 0.25x hours

3. **Friday:** 3 hours + 45 minutes = 3.75 hours

4. **Saturday:** 3 episodes * 2 hours/episode = 6 hours

5. **Sunday:** 3 episodes * 15 minutes/episode = 45 minutes
   Convert to hours: 45 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 0.75 hours

6. **Total TV Time:** 16 hours + 0.25x hours + 3.75 hours + 6 hours + 0.75 hours = 26.5 + 0.25x hours

7. **Equate to 20 hours:** 26.5 + 0.25x = 20

8. **Solve for x:**
   0.25x = -6.5
   x = -26

Since we cannot have a negative number of episodes, this indicates an error in the problem setup or the given information. It's impossible for Santiago to have watched 20 hours of TV with the given details.

**Explanation:**

My previous answers were incorrect because I struggled to accurately calculate the total time spent watching TV across all the days. I likely made mistakes in converting different time units (hours and minutes) to a consistent unit before summing them up. 

**Error Keywords:**

- Time Units (hours, minutes)
- Calculation
- Word Problem
- Time Conversion

**Solution:**

Here's the correct step-by-step solution:

1. **Tuesday & Wednesday:** 2 nights * 4 hours/night = 8 hours
2. **Thursday:** Let 'x' be the number of 15-minute episodes. Total time on Thursday = x * 15 minutes = x/4 hours
3. **Friday:** 3 hours + 45 minutes = 3.75 hours
4. **Saturday:** 3 episodes * 2 hours/episode = 6 hours
5. **Sunday:** 3 episodes * 15 minutes/episode = 45 minutes = 0.75 hours
6. **Total Time:** 8 + x/4 + 3.75 + 6 + 0.75 = 20 hours
7. **Solve for x:**
    - 18.5 + x/4 = 20
    - x/4 = 1.5
    - x = 6

**Therefore, Santiago watched 6 episodes of the 15-minute show on Thursday.**

**Instructions for Future Problems:**

1. **Identify the key information:**  List the days, episode durations, and any given total time.
2. **Convert all time units to a consistent unit:**  Choose either hours or minutes and convert everything accordingly.
3. **Break down the problem:** Calculate the time spent watching TV on each day separately.
4. **Use variables if needed:**  If there are unknown quantities (like the number of episodes on Thursday), assign a variable to represent it.
5. **Set up an equation:**  Use the known information and the variable to create an equation representing the total time.
6. **Solve the equation:**  Isolate the variable to find the answer.

**General Advice:**

- **Read carefully:** Pay close attention to the wording of the problem to avoid misinterpreting information.
- **Visualize:**  Try to create a mental picture of the situation to better understand the relationships between the different time periods.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Santiago watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Tuesday and Wednesday, he watched 4-hour episodes of his favorite show each night. On Thursday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. On Friday, he finished homework early and watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 2-hour episodes. On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 15.0

Your previous reflection answers were:
Reflection 1: 20.0
Reflection 2: 15.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

**Explanation:**

My previous answers were incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the total TV time spent on each day and then sum them up. I likely made assumptions about the number of 15-minute episodes watched on Thursday without properly considering the time spent on other days.

**Error Keywords:**

- Time Calculation
- Unit Conversion
- Summation
- Assumption

**Instructions:**

1. **Calculate TV time for each day:**
    - Tuesday & Wednesday: 4 hours/episode * 2 episodes = 8 hours
    - Thursday:  Let 'x' be the number of 15-minute episodes. Total time = x * 15/60 hours = 0.25x hours
    - Friday: 3 hours + 45/60 hours = 3.75 hours
    - Saturday: 2 hours/episode * 3 episodes = 6 hours
    - Sunday: 15 minutes/episode * 3 episodes = 45 minutes = 0.75 hours
2. **Sum the TV time for all days:** 8 + 0.25x + 3.75 + 6 + 0.75 = 18.5 + 0.25x
3. **Set the sum equal to 20 hours:** 18.5 + 0.25x = 20
4. **Solve for x:**
    - 0.25x = 1.5
    - x = 6

**Advice:**

- Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
- Pay close attention to unit conversions when dealing with different time units.
- Double-check your calculations and ensure they align with the given information.
- Avoid making assumptions; rely on the provided data to solve the problem.



**Solution:** Santiago watched **6** 15-minute episodes on Thursday.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Simplify the sugar-to-water ratio:**

* The ratio 54:27 simplifies to 2:1 (divide both sides by 27). This means for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, Nia uses 1 cup of water.

**2. Calculate the cups of water used:**

* Since Nia used 240 teaspoons of sugar, and the ratio is 2:1, she used 240 teaspoons / 2 = 120 cups of water.

**3. Calculate the tablespoons of cream used:**

* Nia uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every 1 teaspoon of sugar.
* She used 240 teaspoons of sugar, so she used 240 teaspoons * 2 tablespoons/teaspoon = 480 tablespoons of cream.

**4. Calculate the tablespoons of milk used:**

* Nia uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water.
* She used 120 cups of water, so she used 120 cups * (8 tablespoons milk / 8 cups water) = 120 tablespoons of milk.

**5.  Check the total:**

*  Total ingredients used: 240 teaspoons sugar + 120 cups water + 480 tablespoons cream + 120 tablespoons milk = 240 + 120 + 480 + 120 = 960 


**Answer:** Nia used 240 teaspoons of sugar.",240.0,0,"A: Let's think step by step. 

This problem involves multiple ratios and a total amount. Here's how we can break it down:

**1. Understand the Ratios:**

* **Sugar to Water:** 54:27  (This simplifies to 2:1)
* **Milk to Water:** 8 tablespoons : 8 cups 
* **Cream to Sugar:** 2 tablespoons : 1 teaspoon

**2.  Calculate the Amount of Water:**

* Since the sugar to water ratio is 2:1 and Nia used 240 teaspoons of sugar total, we can figure out the amount of water.
*  Let 'x' represent the total number of teaspoons of sugar and water combined.
*  We know 2/3 of 'x' represents the sugar (240 teaspoons).
*  Therefore, x = 240 teaspoons * (3/2) = 360 teaspoons.
*  This means she used 360 - 240 = 120 teaspoons of water.

**3. Calculate the Amount of Cream:**

* The cream to sugar ratio is 2 tablespoons : 1 teaspoon.
* Since she used 240 teaspoons of sugar total, she used 2 * 240 = 480 tablespoons of cream.

**4. Calculate the Amount of Milk:**

* The milk to water ratio is 8 tablespoons : 8 cups.
* Since she used 120 teaspoons of water, she used 8 * 120 / 8 = 120 tablespoons of milk.

**5.  Verify the Total:**

*  Total ingredients: 240 teaspoons (sugar) + 120 teaspoons (water) + 480 tablespoons (cream) + 120 tablespoons (milk) = 960 teaspoons and tablespoons.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Aisha was preparing for a lunch party at her house, where she intended to serve stuffed peppers. She noticed that she was out of plastic forks, so she bought a new package of forks. Later, her husband also bought a package of 8 new forks and gave them to Aisha. While Aisha was making the stuffed peppers, she used sixteen of the forks to sample her stuffed peppers, then threw away 6 defective forks. The guests also brought 2 packs of forks, each having 6 inside them. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 32 forks. How many forks were in the package that Aisha bought?
Your initial answer was: A: Let's think step by step to solve this problem:

1. **Start with the known:** Aisha had 32 forks at the end.

2. **Guests' forks:** The guests brought 2 packs * 6 forks/pack = 12 forks.

3. **Total forks before Aisha used any:** Aisha had 32 forks - 12 forks (guests) = 20 forks.

4. **Forks before discarding defective ones:**  Aisha had 20 forks + 6 defective forks = 26 forks.

5. **Forks before sampling:** Aisha had 26 forks - 16 forks (sampling) = 10 forks.

6. **Forks before her husband's contribution:** Aisha had 10 forks - 8 forks (husband) = 2 forks.

7. **Forks in Aisha's initial package:** Aisha started with 2 forks.


**Therefore, the package Aisha bought contained 2 forks.**
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer

My previous answer was incorrect because I made a fundamental error in understanding the problem's context. I incorrectly assumed that Aisha started with only 2 forks, which is not stated in the problem.  I failed to account for the fact that she bought a package of forks before her husband bought more.

**Error Keywords:**

- **Misinterpretation:** I misunderstood the initial state of the problem.
- **Logical Fallacy:** I made an incorrect assumption that led to a flawed solution.
- **Contextual Error:** I failed to consider all relevant information provided in the problem.

## Corrected Solution

1. **Start with the known:** Aisha had 32 forks at the end.

2. **Guests' forks:** The guests brought 2 packs * 6 forks/pack = 12 forks.

3. **Total forks before Aisha used any:** Aisha had 32 forks - 12 forks (guests) = 20 forks.

4. **Forks before discarding defective ones:** Aisha had 20 forks + 6 defective forks = 26 forks.

5. **Forks before sampling:** Aisha had 26 forks - 16 forks (sampling) = 10 forks.

6. **Forks before her husband's contribution:** Aisha had 10 forks - 8 forks (husband) = 2 forks.

7. **Forks in Aisha's initial package:**  This is the key step. Since Aisha started with 2 forks and bought a package before her husband bought more, the package she bought must have contained **30 forks** (32 total forks - 2 forks she started with).

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answer of 2.0 was incorrect because I failed to carefully track the changing number of forks throughout the scenario. I likely made a calculation error while trying to isolate the number of forks Aisha initially bought. I also missed crucial information about the guests bringing additional forks.

**Error Keywords:**

- Calculation error
- Quantity tracking
- Word problem interpretation
- Missing information

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Start with the known:** Aisha had 32 forks at the end.

2. **Work backward:**
    - The guests brought 2 packs * 6 forks/pack = 12 forks.
    - Before the guests arrived, Aisha had 32 forks - 12 forks = 20 forks.

3. **Account for the defective forks:** Before discarding the defective forks, Aisha had 20 forks + 6 forks = 26 forks.

4. **Account for the sampling:** Before sampling the peppers, Aisha had 26 forks + 16 forks = 42 forks.

5. **Account for her husband's contribution:** Before her husband bought forks, Aisha had 42 forks - 8 forks = 34 forks.

6. **Determine the initial purchase:**  Aisha bought 34 forks - the number of forks she started with.  We don't know how many forks she started with, so we can't determine the exact number she bought.

**Wrong answer:** Sarah spends $21.00. 

**Explanation:**

I incorrectly calculated the discount amount.

**Error Keywords:**

- Discount
- Percentage
- Calculation

**Instructions:**

1. Calculate the total cost of the cupcakes before the discount.
2. Calculate the total cost of the cookies before the discount.
3. Calculate the total cost of all items before the discount.
4. Calculate the discount amount by multiplying the total cost by the discount percentage.
5. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final price.

**Advice:**

- Always double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with percentages.

1. **Identify the events:** Clearly define what each event is in the problem.
2. **Determine independence:**  Analyze if the events are independent (the outcome of one doesn't affect the other) or dependent (the outcome of one affects the other).
3. **Calculate individual probabilities:** Determine the probability of each event occurring separately.
4. **Adjust for dependence:** If events are dependent, adjust the probability of the second event based on the outcome of the first.
5. **Multiply probabilities:** For independent events, multiply the probabilities of each event to find the overall probability. For dependent events, multiply the probabilities of each event, taking into account the adjustments made for dependence.
6. **Express the difference:** If the question asks for the difference in probabilities, subtract the smaller probability from the larger probability. Convert the result to a percentage point difference by multiplying by 100%.

## General Advice:

* **Read carefully:** Pay close attention to the wording of the problem to understand the events and the desired outcome.
* **Visualize:** Try to visualize the events and the possible outcomes to aid in understanding.
* **Break down complex problems:** Divide complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.
* **Double-check your work:** Always review your calculations and ensure they are accurate.
* **Practice:** The more you practice probability problems, the better you will become at identifying patterns and applying the correct formulas.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

**Explanation:**

My previous answers were incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the probabilities of the two events involved. I likely made a mistake in counting the favorable outcomes for each event and/or in understanding how to calculate probabilities for multiple events. 

**Error Keywords:**

- Probability
- Multiple Events
- Counting Outcomes
- Conditional Probability

**Instructions:**

1. **Define the Events:** Clearly state the two events: rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row and rolling four even numbers in a row.
2. **Calculate Individual Probabilities:**
    -  Determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a single roll.
    -  Determine the probability of rolling an even number on a single roll.
3. **Calculate Probabilities of Multiple Events:**
    -  Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row (multiply the probability of the first roll by the probability of the second roll, considering the die is not replaced).
    -  Calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row (multiply the probability of the first roll by the probability of the second, third, and fourth rolls).
4. **Find the Difference:** Subtract the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row.
5. **Convert to Percentage Points:** Multiply the difference in probabilities by 100 to express it as a percentage difference.

**Advice:**

- Carefully read and understand the problem statement.
- Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.
- Double-check your calculations and make sure your reasoning is sound.
- Visualize the events and outcomes to aid in understanding.



## Solution:

1. **Event 1:** Rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row.
   - Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a single roll: 15/20 = 3/4
   - Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16

2. **Event 2:** Rolling four even numbers in a row.
   - Probability of rolling an even number on a single roll: 10/20 = 1/2
   - Probability of rolling four even numbers in a row: (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16

3. **Difference in Probabilities:** 9/16 - 1/16 = 8/16 = 1/2

4. **Percentage Point Difference:** (1/2) * 100% = 50%



Therefore, it is **50 percentage points** more likely that Yusuf rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row than that he rolls four even numbers in a row.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

My previous answers of 5.0 were incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the probabilities of both events: rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row and rolling four even numbers in a row. I likely made a hasty calculation without carefully considering all the possibilities on a twenty-sided die.

**Keywords Describing Errors:**

1. **Calculation Error:**  The fundamental issue was an inaccurate calculation.
2. **Probability Misunderstanding:** I didn't fully grasp how to calculate probabilities for multiple dependent events.
3. **Insufficient Consideration of Possibilities:** I didn't adequately consider all the possible outcomes on a twenty-sided die.

## Corrected Solution

**Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row**

* Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on the first roll: 15/20 
* Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on the second roll (given the first was greater than 5): 14/19 (since one number is gone)
* Probability of both events happening: (15/20) * (14/19) = 21/38

**Event 2: Rolling four even numbers in a row**

* Probability of rolling an even number: 10/20
* Probability of rolling four even numbers in a row: (10/20) * (10/19) * (10/18) * (10/17) = 25/306

**Difference in Probability:**

*  (21/38) - (25/306) = 0.5526 - 0.0817 = 0.4709

**Converting to Percentage Points:**

* 0.4709 * 100% = 47.09 percentage points


## Instructions for Future Success

1. **Clearly Define Events:**  Explicitly state what each event represents (e.g., rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row).
2. **Calculate Individual Probabilities:** Determine the probability of each individual event separately.
3. **Account for Dependent Events:**  If events are dependent (like rolling without replacement), adjust probabilities accordingly.
4. **Use the Correct Formula:** Apply the appropriate probability formula for the type of events involved (e.g., multiplication for independent events, conditional probability for dependent events).
5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Carefully review all calculations to avoid errors.

## General Advice for Similar Problems

* **Visualize the Sample Space:**  Imagine all possible outcomes to better understand the probabilities.
* **Break Down Complex Problems:** Divide complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.
* **Practice Regularly:**  Solving various probability problems will improve your understanding and calculation skills.
* **Seek Clarification:** Don't hesitate to ask for help or clarification if you encounter difficulties.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

Question: Mia went to her greenhouse to pick some blueberries and found 2/3 as many beetles as bees in the plot. Mia then found 26 white animals, half of which were rabbits. In addition, she saw 24 wasps, and 9 bees. What percentage of animals in the plot were rabbits?
Your initial answer was: A: Let's think step by step. 

This problem has several parts, so let's break it down:

**1. Finding the number of bees:**

* We know Mia saw 9 bees.

**2. Finding the number of beetles:**

* Mia found 2/3 as many beetles as bees, so she saw (2/3) * 9 = 6 beetles.

**3. Finding the number of rabbits:**

* Mia saw 26 white animals, and half were rabbits, so she saw 26 / 2 = 13 rabbits.

**4. Calculating the percentage of rabbits:**

*  The total number of animals is 9 bees + 6 beetles + 13 rabbits + 24 wasps = 52 animals.
* The percentage of rabbits is (13 rabbits / 52 total animals) * 100% = 25%.


**Therefore, 25% of the animals in the plot were rabbits.**
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.

p2,gsm-symbolic,google/gemma-2-9b-it,"Mrs. Lee is looking for a new townhouse that will not go beyond her $340000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $400000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?",11000.0,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the discount:**

* Discount amount = 25% of $400,000 = (25/100) * $400,000 = $100,000

**2. Calculate the price after the discount:**

* Price after discount = Selling price - Discount amount 
* Price after discount = $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000

**3. Calculate the brokerage fee:**

* Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = (5/100) * $400,000 = $20,000

**4. Calculate the transfer fee:**

* Transfer fee = 12% of $400,000 = (12/100) * $400,000 = $48,000

**5. Calculate the total cost:**

* Total cost = Price after discount + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
* Total cost = $300,000 + $20,000 + $48,000 = $368,000

**6. Calculate the difference between the total cost and Mrs. Lee's budget:**

* Difference = Total cost - Mrs. Lee's budget

He paid the legal fees that amounted to 2% of the selling price and also paid a realtor fee that is 5% of the selling price. He also paid $440000 for the remaining loan amount on the villa, and $5000 for closing costs. Dr. Brown used the net proceeds from selling the villa to invest in stocks. The stocks gained 10% each year for two years. How much were Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years?",80465.0,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the legal fees:**

* Legal fees = 2% of $550,000 = (2/100) * $550,000 = $11,000

**2. Calculate the realtor fees:**

* Realtor fees = 5% of $550,000 = (5/100) * $550,000 = $27,500

**3. Calculate the total expenses:**

* Total expenses = Legal fees + Realtor fees + Loan amount + Closing costs
* Total expenses = $11,000 + $27,500 + $440,000 + $5,000 = $483,500

**4. Calculate the net proceeds from selling the villa:**

* Net proceeds = Selling price - Total expenses
* Net proceeds = $550,000 - $483,500 = $66,500

**5. Calculate the stock gains in the first year:**

* Gain in year 1 = 10% of $66,500 = (10/100) * $66,500 = $6,650

**6. Calculate the value of the stocks after the first year:**

* Value after year 1 = Net proceeds + Gain in year 1
* Value after year 1 = $66,500 + $6,650 = $73,150

**7. Calculate the stock gains in the second year:**

* Gain in year 2 = 10% of $73,150 = (10/100) * $73,150 = $7,315

**8. Calculate the final value of the stocks after two years:**

* Final value = Value after year 1 + Gain in year 2

My previous answer was incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the cost of the discounted fudge. I incorrectly applied the discount to the entire 21 kg purchase instead of just the 4 kg portion. This led to an inaccurate total spending amount and ultimately an incorrect final answer.

**Error Keywords:**

- Calculation error
- Discount application error
- Arithmetic error
- Misinterpretation of problem details

## Corrected Solution

**1. Calculate the cost of the fudge:**

* Priya bought 15 kgs of fudge at ₺22 per kg: 15 * ₺22 = ₺330
* She bought 4 kgs at a 1/4 discount: ₺22 * 0.25 = ₺5.50 discount per kg
* Discounted price per kg: ₺22 - ₺5.50 = ₺16.50
* Cost of discounted fudge: 4 * ₺16.50 = ₺66
* Total cost of fudge: ₺330 + ₺66 = ₺396

**2. Calculate the cost of the postcards:**

* Priya bought 12 postcards at ₺21.0 each: 12 * ₺21.0 = ₺252

**3. Calculate Priya's total spending:**

* Total spending: ₺396 (fudge) + ₺11 (sand dollars) + ₺252 (postcards) = ₺659

**4. Calculate Priya's remaining money:**

* Money left after spending: ₺1200 - ₺659 = ₺541

**5. Account for the donation:**

* Money left after donation: ₺541 - ₺5 = ₺536



**Answer:** Priya has ₺536 left.

My previous answers were incorrect because I struggled to accurately calculate the cost of the fudge and the total spending. I likely made mistakes in applying the discount on the fudge and in adding up all the expenses. 

**Error Keywords:**

- Discounts
- Multiple Purchases
- Money Calculations
- Word Problem

**Solution:**

1. **Fudge Cost:**
    -  21 kgs of fudge is more than 15 kgs, so we'll calculate the cost in two parts:
        - 15 kgs at ₺22/kg = 15 * 22 = ₺330
        - Remaining 6 kgs (21-15) get a 1/4 discount: 6 * 22 * (3/4) = ₺49.50
    - Total fudge cost: ₺330 + ₺49.50 = ₺379.50

2. **Total Expenses:**
    - Fudge: ₺379.50
    - Sand Dollars: ₺11.00
    - Postcards: 12 * ₺21.00 = ₺252.00
    - Total Expenses: ₺379.50 + ₺11.00 + ₺252.00 = ₺642.50

3. **Money Left:**
    - Starting Money: ₺1200.00
    - Charity Donation: ₺5.00
    - Money Left: ₺1200.00 - ₺642.50 - ₺5.00 = ₺552.50

1. **Break down the problem:** Identify all purchases and their individual costs.
2. **Calculate discounts:** Apply discounts carefully, remembering to calculate the discounted amount accurately.
3. **Sum up expenses:** Add up the cost of all purchases.
4. **Subtract expenses from starting money:** Calculate the remaining money after all expenses and donations.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Priya's Beach Trip

**Explanation:**

My previous answers were incorrect because I struggled to accurately calculate the cost of the fudge and the total spending. I likely made mistakes in applying the discount on the fudge and in adding up all the expenses. 

**Error Keywords:**

- Discounts
- Multiple Purchases
- Money Calculations
- Word Problem

**Solution:**

1. **Fudge Cost:**
    -  21 kgs of fudge is more than 15 kgs, so we'll calculate the cost in two parts:
        - 15 kgs at ₺22/kg = 15 * 22 = ₺330
        - Remaining 6 kgs (21-15) get a 1/4 discount: 6 * 22 * (3/4) = ₺49.50
    - Total fudge cost: ₺330 + ₺49.50 = ₺379.50

2. **Total Expenses:**
    - Fudge: ₺379.50
    - Sand dollars: ₺11.00
    - Postcards: 12 * ₺21.00 = ₺252.00
    - Total expenses: ₺379.50 + ₺11.00 + ₺252.00 = ₺642.50

3. **Money Remaining:**
    - Starting money: ₺1200.00
    - Charity donation: ₺5.00
    - Money left: ₺1200.00 - ₺642.50 - ₺5.00 = ₺552.50



**Instructions:**

1. **Identify Discounts:** Carefully read for discount information, noting the conditions and the amount of the discount.
2. **Break Down Purchases:** Separate purchases into individual items and calculate their costs separately.
3. **Apply Discounts:** Calculate the discounted price for each item based on the discount terms.
4. **Sum Expenses:** Add up the cost of all items, including the discounted ones.
5. **Subtract Expenses:** Subtract total expenses from the starting amount of money.

**Advice:**

- **Read Carefully:** Pay close attention to all details in the problem, especially regarding discounts and multiple purchases.
- **Organize Calculations:** Break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps to avoid errors.
- **Double-Check:** Always double-check your calculations and ensure all units are consistent.
- **Visual Aids:** Consider using diagrams or lists to visualize the problem and track expenses.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

My previous answers were incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the number of spotted puppies after Jamal's discovery. I incorrectly assumed that half of Jamal's unspotted puppies *immediately* became spotted, without considering the total number of puppies he started with. 

**Keywords describing the error:**

* **Calculation:**  The core issue was a flawed calculation.
* **Misinterpretation:** I misunderstood the wording about the vet visit.
* **Scope:** I didn't consider the full scope of puppies involved.

## Corrected Solution

**Step 1: Calculate spotted puppies per dog:**

* Jamal: 23 spotted puppies
* Gabriel: 13 spotted puppies
* Yuki: 54 dogs * 13 puppies/dog = 702 spotted puppies

**Step 2: Calculate unspotted puppies for Jamal:**

* Jamal: 131 puppies - 23 spotted puppies = 108 unspotted puppies

**Step 3: Calculate new spotted puppies for Jamal:**

* Jamal: 108 unspotted puppies / 2 = 54 new spotted puppies
* Jamal: 23 spotted puppies + 54 new spotted puppies = 77 spotted puppies

**Step 4: Calculate total spotted puppies:**

* Total: 77 (Jamal) + 13 (Gabriel) + 702 (Yuki) = 792 spotted puppies

**Step 5: Calculate total puppies:**

* Total: 131 (Jamal) + 47 (Gabriel) + (54 dogs * 13 puppies/dog) = 131 + 47 + 702 = 880 puppies

**Step 6: Calculate percentage of spotted puppies:**

* Percentage: (792 spotted puppies / 880 total puppies) * 100% = 90%

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answer was incorrect because I made a rounding error when calculating the number of almonds Carlos eats and the number of bowls needed.  I rounded 129.6 almonds down to 129, which led to an inaccurate calculation of the remaining almonds and subsequently, the number of additional bowls required.

**Error Keywords:**

- Rounding error
- Approximation error
- Integer truncation

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Capacity of a table:** Each table can hold 3 * 24 = 72 almonds.

2. **Total capacity of tables:** With 3 tables, the total capacity is 3 * 72 = 216 almonds.

3. **Capacity after broken tables:** After 2 tables break, the capacity reduces to 1 * 72 = 72 almonds.

4. **Almonds placed on tables:** Carlos can place 72 almonds on the remaining table.

5. **Almonds remaining after placing on tables:** He has 720 - 72 = 648 almonds left.

6. **Almonds eaten:** Carlos eats 648 / 5 = 129.6 almonds. Since we can't have fractions of almonds, we'll round this up to 130 almonds.

7. **Almonds remaining after eating:** He has 648 - 130 = 518 almonds left.

8. **Almonds placed in bowls:** He can place 7 * 24 = 168 almonds in the bowls.

9. **Almonds remaining to be placed:** He has 518 - 168 = 350 almonds left.

10. **Number of additional bowls needed:** He needs 350 / 24 = 14.583 bowls. Since we can't have fractions of bowls, he needs 15 additional bowls.




**Therefore, Carlos needs 15 more bowls to place all the remaining almonds.**

How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?",14.0,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the capacity of each table:**

* Each table holds three times the capacity of a bowl: 24 almonds/bowl * 3 = 72 almonds/table

**2. Calculate the total capacity of all tables:**

* Total capacity of tables: 72 almonds/table * 3 tables = 216 almonds

**3. Calculate the total capacity of all bowls:**

* Total capacity of bowls: 24 almonds/bowl * 7 bowls = 168 almonds

**4. Calculate the total capacity Carlos has:**

* Total capacity: 216 almonds (tables) + 168 almonds (bowls) = 384 almonds

**5. Calculate the number of almonds remaining after 2 tables break:**

* Capacity after tables break: 216 almonds (tables) - 72 almonds/table * 2 tables = 72 almonds 

* Total capacity remaining: 72 almonds (tables) + 168 almonds (bowls) = 240 almonds

**6. Calculate the number of almonds Carlos eats:**

* Almonds eaten: 720 almonds * (1/5) = 144 almonds

**7. Calculate the number of almonds remaining:**

* Remaining almonds: 720 almonds - 144 almonds = 576 almonds

**8. Calculate the number of bowls needed:**

* Bowls needed: 576 almonds / 24 almonds/bowl = 24 bowls

**9. Calculate the number of additional bowls needed:**

* Additional bowls: 24 bowls - 7 bowls = 17 bowls



**Answer:** Carlos needs 17 more bowls.",17.0,0,"A: Let's think step by step:

1. **Capacity of a table:** Each table can hold 3 * 24 = 72 almonds.

2. **Total capacity of tables:**  With 3 tables, the total capacity is 3 * 72 = 216 almonds.

3. **Capacity after broken tables:** After 2 tables break, the capacity reduces to 1 * 72 = 72 almonds.

4. **Almonds placed on tables:** Carlos can place 72 almonds on the remaining table.

5. **Almonds remaining after placing on tables:**  He has 720 - 72 = 648 almonds left.

6. **Almonds eaten:** Carlos eats 648 / 5 = 129.6 almonds. Since we can't have fractions of almonds, let's assume he eats 129 almonds.

7. **Almonds remaining after eating:** He has 648 - 129 = 519 almonds left.

8. **Almonds placed in bowls:** He can place 7 * 24 = 168 almonds in the bowls.

9. **Almonds remaining to be placed:** He has 519 - 168 = 351 almonds left.

10. **Number of additional bowls needed:** He needs 351 / 24 = 14.625 bowls. Since we can't have fractions of bowls, he needs 15 additional bowls.

Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","Let's break down this age puzzle step-by-step. 

**Why I Was Incorrect:**

My previous answer, 22.5, was likely incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the ages of all four individuals in 4 years. I probably jumped to conclusions without carefully considering the relationships between their ages and how they would change over time. 

**Keywords Describing Errors:**

* **Age Relationships:** Misinterpreted the relationships between ages, particularly Aisha's age relative to Diego's future age. 
* **Future vs. Present:** Confused future ages with present ages, leading to incorrect calculations.
* **Multiple Steps:** Overlooked the need to calculate multiple ages individually before finding the average.

**Correct Solution:**

1. **Aisha's Age in 9 Years:** In 9 years, Aisha will be twice Diego's current age, meaning she'll be 2 * 19 = 38 years old.

2. **Aisha's Current Age:** Since Aisha will be 38 in 9 years, her current age is 38 - 9 = 29 years old.

3. **Esteban's Current Age:** Esteban is 6 years younger than Diego, so he is currently 19 - 6 = 13 years old.

4. **Nadia's Current Age:** Nadia is 10 years older than Esteban, making her 13 + 10 = 23 years old.

5. **Ages in 4 Years:** 
   * Diego: 19 + 4 = 23 years old
   * Aisha: 29 + 4 = 33 years old
   * Esteban: 13 + 4 = 17 years old
   * Nadia: 23 + 4 = 27 years old

6. **Average Age in 4 Years:** (23 + 33 + 17 + 27) / 4 = 26 years old.



**Instructions for Future Problems:**

1. **Identify Key Information:** Carefully read the entire problem, highlighting ages, relationships, and future timeframes. 
2. **Define Variables:** Assign variables to represent each person's age. 
3. **Translate Relationships:** Convert word descriptions of relationships (e.g., ""twice as old"") into mathematical equations. 
4. **Work Forward and Backward:** Use equations to calculate future ages, then work backward to find present ages if needed. 
5. **Check Units:** Ensure all calculations involve consistent units (years). 
6. **Double-Check:** Review your work carefully, looking for potential errors in calculations or logic. 

**General Advice:**

* **Visualize:** Draw diagrams or timelines to represent age relationships. 
* **Break Down Complex Problems:** Divide complex problems into smaller, manageable steps. 
* **Practice:** Regularly solve age-related word problems to improve your understanding and accuracy. 
* **Don't Rush:** Take your time to carefully analyze the problem before jumping into calculations.

   - Aisha will be twice Diego's current age in 9 years, so she will be 19 * 2 = 38 years old.

2. **Esteban's age:**
   - Esteban is 6 years younger than Diego, so he is currently 19 - 6 = 13 years old.

3. **Nadia's age:**
   - Nadia is 10 years older than Esteban, so she is currently 13 + 10 = 23 years old.

4. **Ages in 4 years:**
   - Diego in 4 years: 19 + 4 = 23 years old
   - Aisha in 4 years: 38 - 5 = 33 years old
   - Esteban in 4 years: 13 + 4 = 17 years old
   - Nadia in 4 years: 23 + 4 = 27 years old

5. **Average age in 4 years:**
   - The sum of their ages in 4 years is 23 + 33 + 17 + 27 = 90
   - The average age is 90 / 4 = 22.5 years old.



**Therefore, the average age of all four in 4 years will be 22.5 years old.**",22.5,0,3.0,0.0,26.5,"--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

- Double-check calculations at each step to avoid accumulating errors. 
- Remember to adjust ages for future timeframes. 



## Solution: 

1. **Aisha's age in 9 years:** 19 * 2 = 38 years old. 
2. **Esteban's age:** 19 - 6 = 13 years old. 
3. **Nadia's age:** 13 + 10 = 23 years old. 
4. **Ages in 4 years:** 
    - Diego: 19 + 4 = 23 years old. 
    - Aisha: 38 + 4 = 42 years old. 
    - Esteban: 13 + 4 = 17 years old. 
    - Nadia: 23 + 4 = 27 years old. 
5. **Average age:** (23 + 42 + 17 + 27) / 4 = 26.5 years old. 



Therefore, the average age of all four in 4 years will be **26.5**.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

**Explanation:**

My previous answers were incorrect because I failed to accurately account for the time spent walking back home and then returning to the gym. I only considered the initial time spent walking to the gym and didn't factor in the round trip back home.

**Error Keywords:**

- Time Management
- Round Trip
-  Path Planning

**Corrected Solution:**

1. **Calculate total time spent walking to the gym:** 16 minutes (to the corner) + 52 minutes (to the gym) = 68 minutes.

2. **Calculate time spent walking back home and to the gym again:** 52 minutes (to the gym) + 16 minutes (to the corner) = 68 minutes.

3. **Calculate total time spent walking:** 68 minutes + 68 minutes = 136 minutes.

4. **Calculate remaining time:** 246 minutes (total time) - 136 minutes (walking time) = 110 minutes.


**Instructions for Future Attempts:**

1. **Identify all segments of the journey:** Break down the walk into distinct segments (e.g., home to corner, corner to gym, gym to home, home to gym).
2. **Calculate the time spent on each segment:** Add up the time for each segment.
3. **Account for round trips:** If there are any backtracking segments, double the time spent on those segments.
4. **Subtract total walking time from the total available time:** This will give you the remaining time.

**General Advice:**

- **Visualize the path:**  Draw a simple diagram to represent the journey. This can help you keep track of the different segments and avoid overlooking any steps.
- **Pay attention to keywords:** Words like ""return,"" ""back,"" and ""again"" indicate the need to account for round trips.

He can make giant cubes that use 12 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 5 ounces, small cubes that use 1/2 of a ounce, and tiny cubes that are half the size of small cubes. He makes 48 total ice cubes, including 10 giant cubes, 14 small cubes, 12 medium cubes, and some tiny cubes. How many ounces of water does Leon have left?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 125.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer

My previous answer was incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the water used for each type of cube and then sum them up. I likely made a mistake in either the multiplication or addition steps, leading to an inaccurate total water usage.

**Keywords Describing Errors:**

* **Calculation:** This is the most general error category.
* **Multiplication:**  I likely made a mistake when calculating the water used for the small and tiny cubes.
* **Addition:** I likely added the water usage for each cube type incorrectly, leading to an inaccurate total.

## Corrected Solution

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Giant Cubes:** 10 giant cubes * 12 ounces/cube = 120 ounces
2. **Small Cubes:** 14 small cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 7 ounces
3. **Tiny Cubes:** 
    * Tiny cubes are half the size of small cubes, so they use 0.5 ounces / 2 = 0.25 ounces per cube.
    * We need to find the number of tiny cubes: 48 total cubes - 10 giant cubes - 14 small cubes - 12 medium cubes = 12 tiny cubes.
    * Total water for tiny cubes: 12 tiny cubes * 0.25 ounces/cube = 3 ounces
4. **Medium Cubes:** 12 medium cubes * 5 ounces/cube = 60 ounces
5. **Total Water Used:** 120 ounces + 7 ounces + 3 ounces + 60 ounces = 190 ounces
6. **Water Remaining:** 312 ounces - 190 ounces = 122 ounces

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

**Explanation:**

My previous answer of 198.0 was incorrect because I failed to account for the following:

* **Friends' contribution:** I didn't deduct the cost of food covered by Oliver's friends.
* **Charity's help:** I didn't calculate the amount covered by the charity and subtract it from the remaining cost.

**Error Keywords:**

* **Cost Breakdown:** I didn't properly break down the costs into categories.
* **Discount/Contribution:** I missed applying the friends' contribution and the charity's help as reductions in the total cost.
* **Calculation:** My overall calculation was flawed due to the above errors.

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Calculate the total daily cost:** ₣100 (hotel) + ₣20 (food) + ₣10 (transportation) = ₣130 per day.

2. **Calculate the total cost for the 2-day workshop:** ₣130/day * 2 days = ₣260.

3. **Subtract the food cost covered by friends:** ₣260 - (₣20/day * 2 days) = ₣260 - ₣40 = ₣220.

4. **Calculate the amount covered by the charity:** ₣220 * (1/10) = ₣22.

5. **Calculate the remaining cost for Oliver:** ₣220 - ₣22 = ₣198.


## Instructions for Future Problems:

1. **Identify all costs:** List every expense mentioned in the problem.
2. **Break down costs:** Categorize costs (e.g., food, transportation, accommodation) and calculate the total for each category.
3. **Identify contributions and discounts:** Note any amounts that will be covered by others or any discounts applied.
4. **Apply contributions and discounts:** Subtract the contributions and discounts from the relevant cost categories.
5. **Calculate the final cost:** Sum the remaining costs to find the total amount still needed.

## General Advice:

* **Read carefully:** Pay close attention to all details and keywords in the problem.
* **Organize information:** Use lists, tables, or diagrams to keep track of costs, contributions, and discounts.
* **Double-check:** Always review your calculations and ensure they make sense in the context of the problem.

Now, look at this question:
Question: A loaf of bread at the bakery costs €5. The cost of a bagel is one-fourth of a loaf of bread. The bakery has a promotion that if one buys 7 bagels or more, they get a 20% discount on bagels. How much more do 4 loaves of bread cost than 8 bagels?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 8.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

**Explanation:** My previous answers were incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the cost of the bagels, especially considering the discount. I likely made a mistake in either calculating the price of a single bagel or applying the discount correctly.

**Error Keywords:**

- Discount calculation
- Fraction
- Price comparison

**Corrected Solution:**

1. **Calculate the price of a bagel:** A bagel costs one-fourth the price of a loaf of bread, so it costs €5 / 4 = €1.25.

2. **Calculate the cost of 8 bagels:** 8 bagels cost 8 * €1.25 = €10.00.

3. **Calculate the discount on 8 bagels:** Since 8 bagels are more than 7, the customer gets a 20% discount on the bagels. The discount amount is €10.00 * 0.20 = €2.00.

4. **Calculate the final price of 8 bagels:** The final price of 8 bagels is €10.00 - €2.00 = €8.00.

5. **Calculate the cost of 4 loaves of bread:** 4 loaves of bread cost 4 * €5.00 = €20.00.

6. **Find the difference in price:** The difference in price between 4 loaves of bread and 8 bagels is €20.00 - €8.00 = €12.00.



**Instructions for Future Success:**

1. **Break down the problem:** Identify the key pieces of information, such as the price of each item, the quantity, and the discount.
2. **Calculate individual costs:** Determine the price of each item separately before combining them.
3. **Apply discounts accurately:** Calculate the discount amount and subtract it from the original price.
4. **Compare prices carefully:** Ensure you are comparing the correct costs after applying discounts.

**General Advice:**

- **Read carefully:** Pay close attention to the wording of the problem to avoid misunderstandings.
- **Double-check calculations:** Always verify your work to catch any errors.
- **Practice regularly:** Solving word problems consistently will improve your skills and confidence.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

1. **Calculate daily intake before DeShawn's diet:** 
   - Arash: 5 pieces/day
   - Ava: 10 pieces/day 
   - DeShawn: 20 pieces/day
   - Total: 5 + 10 + 20 = 35 pieces/day

2. **Calculate cake consumption in the first two days:** 
   - Total consumed: 35 pieces/day * 2 days = 70 pieces

3. **Calculate remaining cake:** 
   - Cake remaining: 120 pieces - 70 pieces = 50 pieces

4. **Calculate daily intake after DeShawn's diet:** 
   - Arash: 5 pieces/day
   - Ava: 10 pieces/day 
   - DeShawn: 10 pieces/day 
   - Total: 5 + 10 + 10 = 25 pieces/day

5. **Calculate days to eat remaining cake:** 
   - Days: 50 pieces / 25 pieces/day = 2 days 


6. **Calculate total days:** 
   - Total days: 2 days (initial) + 2 days (remaining cake) = 4 days 



**Therefore, it will take 4 days for the cake to be fully eaten.**

p2,gsm-symbolic,google/gemma-2-9b-it,"A giant cake has 120 pieces. Arash can eat 5 pieces a day while Ava can eat twice as much and DeShawn can eat two times as much as Ava. After 2 days, DeShawn decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half. How many days will it take for the cake to be fully eaten?",4.0,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate Ava's daily intake:**

* Ava eats twice as much as Arash, who eats 5 pieces a day.
* Ava eats 2 * 5 = 10 pieces a day.

**2. Calculate DeShawn's daily intake:**

* DeShawn eats twice as much as Ava, who eats 10 pieces a day.
* DeShawn eats 2 * 10 = 20 pieces a day.

**3. Calculate the total daily intake before DeShawn's diet:**

* Arash eats 5 pieces + Ava eats 10 pieces + DeShawn eats 20 pieces = 35 pieces a day.

**4. Calculate DeShawn's new daily intake:**

* DeShawn cuts his intake in half after 2 days.
* DeShawn's new intake is 20 pieces / 2 = 10 pieces a day.

**5. Calculate the total daily intake after DeShawn's diet:**

* Arash eats 5 pieces + Ava eats 10 pieces + DeShawn eats 10 pieces = 25 pieces a day.

**6. Calculate the total pieces eaten in the first 2 days:**

* Total pieces eaten in 2 days is 35 pieces/day * 2 days = 70 pieces.

**7. Calculate the remaining pieces:**

* Remaining pieces are 120 pieces - 70 pieces = 50 pieces.

**8. Calculate the number of days to eat the remaining cake:**

* Days to eat the remaining cake is 50 pieces / 25 pieces/day = 2 days.



**Answer:** It will take a total of 2 + 2 = **4 days** for the cake to be fully eaten.",4.0,1,"A: Let's think step by step...

**1. Calculate Ava's daily intake:**

* Ava eats twice as much as Arash, who eats 5 pieces a day.
* Ava eats 5 * 2 = 10 pieces a day.

**2. Calculate DeShawn's daily intake:**

* DeShawn eats twice as much as Ava, who eats 10 pieces a day.
* DeShawn eats 10 * 2 = 20 pieces a day.

**3. Calculate the total daily intake before DeShawn's diet:**

* Arash eats 5 pieces, Ava eats 10 pieces, and DeShawn eats 20 pieces.
* The total daily intake is 5 + 10 + 20 = 35 pieces.

**4. Calculate DeShawn's new daily intake:**

* DeShawn cuts his intake in half after 2 days.
* His new intake is 20 / 2 = 10 pieces a day.

**5. Calculate the total daily intake after DeShawn's diet:**

* Arash eats 5 pieces, Ava eats 10 pieces, and DeShawn eats 10 pieces.
* The total daily intake is 5 + 10 + 10 = 25 pieces.

**6. Calculate the number of days to eat the cake:**

* The cake has 120 pieces.
* It will take 120 / 25 = 4.8 days to eat the whole cake.


**Since we can't have a fraction of a day, it will take 5 days for the cake to be fully eaten.**",5.0,0,1.0,1.0,4.0,"--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

Now, look at this question:
Question: A giant cake has 120 pieces. Arash can eat 5 pieces a day while Ava can eat twice as much and DeShawn can eat two times as much as Ava. After 2 days, DeShawn decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half. How many days will it take for the cake to be fully eaten?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 5.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

**Explanation:** My previous answer of 5.0 days was incorrect because I failed to account for the changing eating rate of DeShawn after day 2. I also didn't accurately calculate the total daily consumption of all three individuals.

**Error Keywords:**

- Changing Rates
-  Total Consumption
-  Multi-Step Calculation
-  Word Problem

## Corrected Solution:

**Step 1: Calculate daily consumption before DeShawn's diet:**

* Ava's consumption: 5 pieces/day * 2 = 10 pieces/day
* DeShawn's consumption: 10 pieces/day * 2 = 20 pieces/day
* Total daily consumption: 5 + 10 + 20 = 35 pieces/day

**Step 2: Calculate total pieces eaten in the first two days:**

* Total pieces eaten: 35 pieces/day * 2 days = 70 pieces

**Step 3: Calculate DeShawn's new daily consumption:**

* DeShawn's new consumption: 20 pieces/day / 2 = 10 pieces/day

**Step 4: Calculate the new total daily consumption:**

* New total daily consumption: 5 + 10 + 10 = 25 pieces/day

**Step 5: Calculate the remaining pieces:**

* Remaining pieces: 120 - 70 = 50 pieces

**Step 6: Calculate the number of days to eat the remaining pieces:**

* Days to eat remaining pieces: 50 pieces / 25 pieces/day = 2 days


**Step 7: Calculate the total number of days:**

* Total days: 2 days + 2 days = 4 days



## Instructions for Future Problems:

1. **Identify all relevant information:** Carefully read the problem and list the key details, including individual consumption rates, starting quantities, and any changes in consumption.
2. **Break down the problem into steps:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable steps.

**2. Calculate Wednesday's apricot pie sales:**

* Faisal sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie on Wednesday than Thursday: 21 boxes - 13 boxes = 8 boxes

**3. Calculate Friday's sales:**

* Faisal sold the combined amount from Wednesday and Thursday on Friday: (27 boxes + 38 boxes) + (8 boxes + 21 boxes) = 94 boxes

**4. Calculate Wednesday's earnings:**

* Earnings from muffins: 27 boxes * ₺9/box = ₺243
* Earnings from apricot pies: 8 boxes * ₺21/box = ₺168
* Total Wednesday earnings: ₺243 + ₺168 = ₺411

**Therefore, Faisal's average daily earning was ₺1004.67.**",1004.67,0,"A: Let's think step by step...

This problem involves several steps and calculations. Here's how we can break it down:

**1. Calculate Thursday's muffin sales:**

* Faisal sold 11 more boxes of muffins on Thursday than Wednesday, so he sold 27 + 11 = 38 boxes of muffins on Thursday.

**2. Calculate Wednesday's apricot pie sales:**

* Faisal sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie on Wednesday than Thursday, so he sold 21 - 13 = 8 boxes of apricot pie on Wednesday.

**3. Calculate Thursday's apricot pie sales:**

* Faisal sold 21 boxes of apricot pie on Thursday.

**4. Calculate Friday's total sales:**

* Faisal sold as much on Friday as he did in the past two days combined, so he sold (27 + 38) + (8 + 21) = 94 boxes total on Friday.

**5. Calculate Friday's muffin sales:**

* Since Friday's sales were the same as Wednesday and Thursday combined, he sold 27 + 38 = 65 boxes of muffins on Friday.

**6. Calculate Friday's apricot pie sales:**

*  Since Friday's sales were the same as Wednesday and Thursday combined, he sold 8 + 21 = 29 boxes of apricot pie on Friday.

**7. Calculate total muffin sales:**

* Faisal sold a total of 27 + 38 + 65 = 130 boxes of muffins.

**8. Calculate total apricot pie sales:**

* Faisal sold a total of 8 + 21 + 29 = 58 boxes of apricot pie.

**9. Calculate total earnings from muffins:**

* Faisal earned 130 * ₺9 = ₺1170 from muffins.

**10. Calculate total earnings from apricot pies:**

* Faisal earned 58 * ₺21 = ₺1218 from apricot pies.

**11. Calculate total earnings:**

* Faisal earned a total of ₺1170 + ₺1218 = ₺2388.

","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answer was incorrect because I failed to account for the fact that Olga already owns 7 flowers. I calculated the total number of plants needed as if she needed to buy all 9. 

**Error Keywords:**

- **Misinterpretation:** I misunderstood the problem's context.
- **Scope Error:** I didn't consider the given information about Olga's existing flowers.
- **Calculation Error:** I made a calculation error by not adjusting the number of plants to be purchased.

## Corrected Solution:

**1. Calculate the total space needed for the plants:**

* Each plant needs 3 meters of width + 12 meters of space between plants = 15 meters of space per plant.

**2. Determine the number of additional plants Olga needs:**

*  Flower bed length: 132 meters
*  Space per plant: 15 meters
*  Number of plants needed: 132 meters / 15 meters/plant = 8.8 plants. Since Olga can't have a fraction of a plant, she'll need 8 additional plants.

**3. Calculate the cost of the additional plants:**

* Number of plants to buy: 8
* Price per plant: ₣9
* Total cost: 8 plants * ₣9/plant = ₣72

**4. Apply the discount:**

* Olga buys more than 2 plants, so she gets a ₣5 discount.
* Final price: ₣72 - ₣5 = ₣67


**Therefore, Olga will spend ₣67 at the store.**

**Answer:** Olga will spend ₣13 at the store.",13.0,0,"A: Let's think step by step to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the total space needed for the plants:**

* Each plant needs 3 meters of width + 12 meters of space between plants = 15 meters of space per plant.

**2. Determine the number of plants Olga needs:**

*  Flower bed length: 132 meters
*  Space per plant: 15 meters
*  Number of plants: 132 meters / 15 meters/plant = 8.8 plants. Since Olga can't have a fraction of a plant, she'll need 9 plants.

**3. Calculate the cost of the plants:**

* Number of plants: 9 
* Price per plant: ₣9
* Total cost: 9 plants * ₣9/plant = ₣81

**4. Apply the discount:**

* Olga buys more than 2 plants, so she gets a ₣5 discount.
* Final price: ₣81 - ₣5 = ₣76


**Therefore, Olga will spend ₣76 at the store.**",76.0,0,1.0,0.0,445.0,"--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

Now, look at this question:
Question: Olga has a flower bed that is 132 meters long. Olga wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Olga's flowers grow 3meters wide so she needs to leave 12 meters between every plant (including the plants width). Olga already owns 7 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ₣9 at the store. However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 76.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

**Explanation:** My previous answer of 76.0 was incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the number of plants Olga needs, the total cost before the discount, and the final cost after applying the discount. I likely made assumptions about the plant spacing and the discount calculation that were not supported by the problem's information.

**Error Keywords:**

- Plant Spacing
- Discount Calculation
- Quantity Calculation
- Unit Cost

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total space needed:** 132 meters (flower bed length) / 3 meters (plant width) = 44 spaces for plants.
2. **Account for spacing:** 44 spaces - 1 = 43 spaces between plants.
3. **Determine the number of plants needed:** 43 spaces + 7 existing plants = 50 plants.
4. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:** 50 plants * ₣9/plant = ₣450.
5. **Apply the discount:** Since Olga buys more than 2 plants, she gets a ₣5 discount.
6. **Calculate the final cost:** ₣450 - ₣5 = ₣445.


**Instructions for Future Problems:**

1. **Carefully read the entire problem:** Pay attention to all details, including unit measurements, discounts, and existing quantities.
2. **Draw a diagram:** Visualizing the problem can help clarify the relationships between different elements.
3. **Break down the problem into smaller steps:**  Identify the key calculations needed and solve them one by one.
4. **Double-check your work:**  Review your calculations and ensure they are accurate and consistent with the problem's information.

**General Advice:**

- Practice solving similar problems to improve your understanding of the concepts involved.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help if you get stuck.
- Always strive for clarity and precision in your calculations and explanations.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.,163.0,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the time to peel 150 clams:**

* Time per clam to peel: 1 minute / 6 clams = 1/6 minute per clam
* Total time to peel 150 clams: (1/6 minute/clam) * 150 clams = 25 minutes

**2. Calculate the time to wash 150 clams:**

* Time per clam to wash: 12 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 0.2 minutes per clam
* Total time to wash 150 clams: (0.2 minutes/clam) * 150 clams = 30 minutes

**3. Calculate the total time to peel and wash the clams:**

* Total time: 25 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (washing) = 55 minutes

**4. Calculate the total time to sauté the clams:**

* Olga can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes, so she'll need 19 minutes * (150 clams / 30 clams) = 95 minutes to sauté 150 clams.

Question: Olga can peel 6 clams a minute and saute 30 clams in 19 minutes. How many minutes will it take her to peel and saute 150 clams if it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam before peeling it? Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.
Your initial answer was: A: Let's think step by step.

**1. Calculate the time to peel all the clams:**

* Olga peels 6 clams per minute.
* She needs to peel 150 clams.
* Time to peel = 150 clams / 6 clams/minute = 25 minutes.

**2. Calculate the time to wash all the clams:**

* It takes 12 seconds to wash each clam.
* There are 150 clams.
* Total washing time = 12 seconds/clam * 150 clams = 1800 seconds.
* Convert seconds to minutes: 1800 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 30 minutes.

**3. Calculate the total time spent on peeling and washing:**

* Time to peel = 25 minutes
* Time to wash = 30 minutes
* Total time = 25 minutes + 30 minutes = 55 minutes.

**4. Calculate the total time spent on the entire process:**

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answer was incorrect because I failed to account for the fact that Olga needs to saute the clams in batches.  I treated the sauteing time as a constant, ignoring the fact that it depends on the number of clams she can saute at once. This led to an overestimation of the total time.

**Error Keywords:**

- **Logical Error:**  I made an incorrect assumption about the process.
- **Incomplete Understanding:** I didn't fully grasp the constraints of the problem.
- **Calculation Error:** While my calculations were technically correct given my flawed assumption, they led to an inaccurate result.

## Corrected Solution:

**1. Calculate the number of batches:**

* Olga can saute 30 clams in 19 minutes.
* She needs to saute 150 clams.
* Number of batches = 150 clams / 30 clams/batch = 5 batches.

**2. Calculate the total sauteing time:**

* Each batch takes 19 minutes to saute.
* Total sauteing time = 5 batches * 19 minutes/batch = 95 minutes.

**3. Calculate the total time spent on peeling and washing:**

* Time to peel = 150 clams / 6 clams/minute = 25 minutes.
* Time to wash = 150 clams * 12 seconds/clam / 60 seconds/minute = 30 minutes.
* Total time for peeling and washing = 25 minutes + 30 minutes = 55 minutes.

**4. Calculate the total break time:**

* Olga takes a 13-minute break after peeling.
* Total break time = 5 batches * 13 minutes/break = 65 minutes.

**5. Calculate the total time:**

* Total time = Time for peeling and washing + Total sauteing time + Total break time
* Total time = 55 minutes + 95 minutes + 65 minutes = **215 minutes**.



## Instructions for Future Success:

1. **Read the problem carefully:** Identify all the given information and what is being asked.

* Time to peel = 150 clams / 6 clams/minute = 25 minutes.

**2. Calculate the time to wash all the clams:**

* It takes 12 seconds to wash each clam.
* There are 150 clams.
* Total washing time = 12 seconds/clam * 150 clams = 1800 seconds.
* Convert seconds to minutes: 1800 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 30 minutes.

**3. Calculate the total time spent on peeling and washing:**

* Time to peel = 25 minutes
* Time to wash = 30 minutes
* Total time = 25 minutes + 30 minutes = 55 minutes.

**4. Calculate the total time spent on the entire process:**

* Time to peel and wash = 55 minutes
* Break time = 13 minutes
* Time to saute = 19 minutes (given)
* Total time = 55 minutes + 13 minutes + 19 minutes = 87 minutes.



**Therefore, it will take Olga 87 minutes to peel and saute 150 clams.**",150.0,0,3.0,1.0,163.0,"--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answers

**Explanation:** My previous answers were incorrect because I failed to account for the time spent washing the clams and the mandatory break after peeling. I also didn't properly calculate the time needed for both peeling and sauteing. 

**Error Keywords:**

- Time management
- Sequential tasks
- Work rate
- Break duration
-  Unit conversion (seconds to minutes)

**Instructions:**

1. **Calculate washing time:** Multiply the number of clams (150) by the washing time per clam (12 seconds) and convert the result to minutes.
2. **Calculate peeling time:** Divide the total number of clams (150) by Olga's peeling rate (6 clams per minute).
3. **Calculate break time:**  Add the break time (13 minutes).
4. **Calculate sauteing time:** Divide the total number of clams (150) by Olga's sauteing rate (30 clams per 19 minutes).  
5. **Calculate total time:** Add the washing time, peeling time, break time, and sauteing time.

**Advice:**

- Always carefully read the problem and identify all the relevant information, including time constraints, work rates, and any breaks or delays.
- Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.
- Pay attention to units of measurement and convert them as needed.
- Double-check your calculations and ensure they make logical sense in the context of the problem.

**Solution:**

1. **Washing time:** 150 clams * 12 seconds/clam = 1800 seconds = 30 minutes
2. **Peeling time:** 150 clams / 6 clams/minute = 25 minutes
3. **Total time so far:** 30 minutes + 25 minutes = 55 minutes
4. **Sauteing time:** 150 clams / (30 clams / 19 minutes) = 95 minutes
5. **Total time:** 55 minutes + 13 minutes + 95 minutes = **163 minutes** 



Therefore, it will take Olga 163 minutes to peel and saute 150 clams.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

Now, look at this question:
Question: In a 100-item quiz, 40% of the questions are chemistry, 20% are geography, and the rest are equally divided as history and algebra questions. If Aisha is sure to get 25% of the geography questions, 100% of the chemistry questions, and a tenth of the history and algebra questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 46.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answer of 46.0 was incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the number of questions in each category and then the number of questions Aisha would get correct within each category. I likely made a calculation error when distributing the remaining questions between history and algebra.

**Error Keywords:**

- **Percentage:** I struggled with calculating percentages of percentages and distributing percentages across categories.
- **Distribution:** I did not correctly divide the remaining questions equally between history and algebra.
- **Calculation:** I made a mistake in one or more of the arithmetic calculations.

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Chemistry Questions:** 100 items * 40% = 40 chemistry questions
2. **Geography Questions:** 100 items * 20% = 20 geography questions
3. **Remaining Questions:** 100 items - 40 items - 20 items = 40 items
4. **History and Algebra Questions:** 40 items / 2 = 20 questions each
5. **History Questions Correct:** 20 questions * (1/10) = 2 history questions
6. **Algebra Questions Correct:** 20 questions * (1/10) = 2 algebra questions
7. **Total Geography Questions Correct:** 20 questions * 25% = 5 geography questions
8. **Total Chemistry Questions Correct:** 40 questions * 100% = 40 chemistry questions
9. **Total History Questions Correct:** 2 history questions
10. **Total Algebra Questions Correct:** 2 algebra questions
11. **Total Correct Questions:** 5 + 40 + 2 + 2 = 49 questions


## Instructions for Future Problems:

1. **Identify Categories:** Clearly define the different categories involved in the problem.
2. **Calculate Category Percentages:** Determine the percentage of items belonging to each category.
3. **Calculate Items in Each Category:** Multiply the total number of items by the percentage for each category.
4. **Calculate Correct Answers within Categories:**  
    - If a percentage of questions within a category are correct, multiply the number of questions in that category by that percentage.
    - If a fraction of questions within a category are correct, multiply the number of questions in that category by the fraction.
5. **Sum Correct Answers:** Add up the number of correct answers from each category to find the total.

## General Advice:

- **Read Carefully:** Understand the problem thoroughly before attempting to solve it.
- **Break Down the Problem:** Divide complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.
- **Double-Check Calculations:** Carefully review your work to avoid arithmetic errors.
- **Consider Pitfalls:** Be aware of potential issues like percentages of percentages and distributing items across categories.
- **Practice:** Regularly solve percentage-based problems to improve your understanding and accuracy.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answer was incorrect because I failed to account for the fact that Ananya's speed changes on different parts of the trail. While I correctly calculated her speeds before and after the injury, I mistakenly used the same speed for both the beach and sidewalk sections in my time calculations. 

**Error Keywords:**

- Conceptual error
- Misunderstanding of problem context
- Incorrect application of information

## Corrected Solution:

**1. Calculate Ananya's speed on the beach before the injury:**

* She walks 10 miles on the beach and takes 50 minutes.
* Her speed on the beach before the injury was 10 miles / 50 minutes = 0.2 miles per minute.

**2. Calculate Ananya's speed on the sidewalk before the injury:**

* Her sidewalk speed was twice her beach speed, so it was 0.2 miles/minute * 2 = 0.4 miles per minute.

**3. Calculate Ananya's new speed on the beach:**

* Her speed decreased by half, so her new beach speed is 0.2 miles/minute / 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.

**4. Calculate Ananya's new speed on the sidewalk:**

* Her sidewalk speed decreased by half, so her new sidewalk speed is 0.4 miles/minute / 2 = 0.2 miles per minute.

**5. Calculate the time spent walking on the beach:**

* Time spent on the beach = distance / speed = 10 miles / 0.1 miles/minute = 100 minutes.

**6. Calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk:**

* Time spent on the sidewalk = distance / speed = 14 miles / 0.2 miles/minute = 70 minutes.

**7. Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**

* Total time = time on beach + time on sidewalk = 100 minutes + 70 minutes = 170 minutes.



**Therefore, it takes Ananya 170 minutes to complete the entire 24-mile walk.**

Question: Ananya walks 24 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 miles of walking on the beach and 14 miles of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 24.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

I incorrectly answered 24.0 minutes because I failed to consider the impact of Ananya's injury on her walking speed. I simply treated the speeds as constant, ignoring the reduction caused by the injury. 

## Error Keywords:

- **Conceptual misunderstanding:** I didn't fully grasp the relationship between speed, distance, and time, especially when speed changes.
- **Ignoring crucial information:** I overlooked the detail about Ananya's injury affecting her speed. 
- **Calculation error:** Even if I had considered the speed changes, I likely made a calculation mistake due to rushing. 

## Solution:

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Calculate initial speeds:** 
    - Let `x` be Ananya's initial speed on the beach.
    - Her initial speed on the sidewalk is `2x`.

2. **Calculate speeds after injury:**
    - Her speed on the beach after injury is `x/2`.
    - Her speed on the sidewalk after injury is `2x/2 = x`.

3. **Calculate time spent on beach:**
    - Time = Distance / Speed 
    - Time on beach = 10 miles / (x/2) = 20/x hours. 

4. **Calculate time spent on sidewalk:**
    - Time on sidewalk = 14 miles / x hours.

5. **Convert times to minutes:**
    - Time on beach (minutes) = (20/x hours) * 60 minutes/hour = 1200/x minutes.
    - Time on sidewalk (minutes) = (14/x hours) * 60 minutes/hour = 840/x minutes.

6. **Total walk time:**
    - Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk 
    - Total time = 1200/x + 840/x = 2040/x minutes.

7. **Use the given information:**
    - We know 50 minutes are spent on the beach. 
    - Therefore, 1200/x = 50. 

8. **Solve for x:**
    - x = 1200/50 = 24 miles per hour.

9. **Calculate total walk time:**
    - Total time = 2040/x minutes = 2040/24 = 85 minutes.



## Instructions:

1. **Identify speed changes:** Carefully note any instances where speed changes throughout the problem. 
2. **Calculate initial speeds:** Determine the initial speeds for each segment of the journey. 
3. **Adjust speeds:** Calculate the new speeds after any changes are introduced. 
4. **Apply distance, rate, and time formula:** Use the formula Time = Distance / Speed to calculate the time spent on each segment. 
5. **Convert units:** Ensure all units are consistent (e.g., hours to minutes) before performing calculations. 
6. **Combine times:** Add the times spent on each segment to find the total walk time. 

## General Advice:

* **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable steps. 
* **Draw diagrams:** Visualizing the situation can help clarify relationships between distances, speeds, and times. 
* **Check units:** Always double-check units to avoid calculation errors.

p2,gsm-symbolic,google/gemma-2-9b-it,"Amelia initially had 11 dozen cookies, then ate 5 cookies for breakfast, and then hid the rest in the yard for the Easter egg hunt. Elena finds 5 cookies. Mei finds twice as many as Elena. Xavier finds 2 less than Mei. Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier, and Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined. How many cookies are still hidden in the yard?",64.0,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the total cookies Amelia started with:**

* 1 dozen = 12 cookies
* 11 dozen = 11 * 12 = 132 cookies

**2. Calculate cookies remaining after Amelia ate some:**

* 132 cookies - 5 cookies = 127 cookies

**3. Calculate how many cookies Mei found:**

* Elena found 5 cookies.
* Mei found twice as many as Elena: 5 cookies * 2 = 10 cookies

**4. Calculate how many cookies Xavier found:**

* Mei found 10 cookies.
* Xavier found 2 less than Mei: 10 cookies - 2 cookies = 8 cookies

**5. Calculate how many cookies Mohammed found:**

* Xavier found 8 cookies.
* Mohammed found an eighth as many as Xavier: 8 cookies / 8 = 1 cookie

**6. Calculate how many cookies Umar found:**

* Elena found 5 cookies, and Mei found 10 cookies.
* Together they found 5 cookies + 10 cookies = 15 cookies.
* Umar found 2 dozen more than Elena and Mei combined: 15 cookies + (2 dozen * 12 cookies/dozen) = 15 cookies + 24 cookies = 39 cookies.

**7. Calculate the total number of cookies found:**

* Elena: 5 cookies
* Mei: 10 cookies
* Xavier: 8 cookies
* Mohammed: 1 cookie
* Umar: 39 cookies
* Total: 5 + 10 + 8 + 1 + 39 = 63 cookies

**8. Calculate the number of cookies still hidden:**

* Amelia started with 127 cookies.
* 63 cookies were found.
* 127 cookies - 63 cookies = 64 cookies



**Answer:** There are **64** cookies still hidden in the yard.",64.0,1,"A: Let's think step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies Amelia started with:** 11 dozen cookies * 12 cookies/dozen = 132 cookies

2. **Subtract the cookies Amelia ate:** 132 cookies - 5 cookies = 127 cookies

3. **Calculate the number of cookies Mei found:** Elena found 5 cookies, and Mei found twice that amount, so Mei found 5 cookies * 2 = 10 cookies.

4. **Calculate the number of cookies Xavier found:** Mei found 10 cookies, and Xavier found 2 less than that, so Xavier found 10 cookies - 2 cookies = 8 cookies.

5. **Calculate the number of cookies Mohammed found:** Xavier found 8 cookies, and Mohammed found an eighth of that amount, so Mohammed found 8 cookies / 8 = 1 cookie.

6. **Calculate the total number of cookies Elena, Mei, and Xavier found:** 5 cookies + 10 cookies + 8 cookies = 23 cookies

7. **Calculate the total number of cookies Umar found:** Elena and Mei found a combined total of 5 cookies + 10 cookies = 15 cookies. Umar found two dozen cookies more than that, so he found 15 cookies * 12 cookies/dozen = 180 cookies.

8. **Calculate the total number of cookies found:** 23 cookies + 1 cookie + 180 cookies = 204 cookies

9. **Subtract the found cookies from the initial number to find the remaining cookies:** 127 cookies - 204 cookies = -77 cookies

Now, look at this question:
Question: Amelia initially had 11 dozen cookies, then ate 5 cookies for breakfast, and then hid the rest in the yard for the Easter egg hunt. Elena finds 5 cookies. Mei finds twice as many as Elena. Xavier finds 2 less than Mei. Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier, and Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined. How many cookies are still hidden in the yard?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: -77.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answer of -77.0 was incorrect because I failed to accurately track the number of cookies at each stage of the problem. I likely made calculation errors and didn't properly account for the cookies being found by different people. I also missed the crucial step of determining the total number of cookies hidden initially.

**Error Keywords:**

* **Multi-step calculation:** The problem involves multiple operations and stages.
* **Tracking variables:** I failed to keep track of the changing number of cookies at each step.
* **Word problem interpretation:** I struggled to understand the relationships between the characters and their actions regarding the cookies.

## Corrected Solution:

**Step 1: Calculate the initial number of cookies:**

* Amelia had 11 dozen cookies, which is 11 * 12 = 132 cookies.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies after Amelia ate some:**

* Amelia ate 5 cookies, leaving 132 - 5 = 127 cookies.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of cookies found by each person:**

* Elena found 5 cookies.
* Mei found twice as many as Elena, so she found 5 * 2 = 10 cookies.
* Xavier found 2 less than Mei, so he found 10 - 2 = 8 cookies.
* Mohammed found an eighth as many as Xavier, so he found 8 / 8 = 1 cookie.
* Umar found two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined, so he found (10 + 5) * 2 = 30 cookies.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of cookies found:**

* The total number of cookies found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 1 + 30 = 54 cookies.

**Step 5: Calculate the number of cookies still hidden:**

* The number of cookies still hidden is 127 - 54 = 73 cookies.



## Instructions for Future Problems:

1. **Read carefully:** Read the entire problem multiple times to understand all the characters, actions, and relationships.
2. **Identify key information:** Highlight or underline important numbers, quantities, and actions.
3. **Define variables:** Assign variables to represent the unknown quantities.

**Error Keywords:**

- Word Problem
- Multiplication
- Division
- Addition
- Subtraction

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Initial Cookies:** Amelia starts with 11 dozen cookies, which is 11 * 12 = 132 cookies.

2. **Cookies Eaten:** Amelia eats 5 cookies, leaving 132 - 5 = 127 cookies.

3. **Elena's Find:** Elena finds 5 cookies, bringing the total to 127 + 5 = 132 cookies.

4. **Mei's Find:** Mei finds twice as many as Elena, so she finds 5 * 2 = 10 cookies.

5. **Xavier's Find:** Xavier finds 2 less than Mei, so he finds 10 - 2 = 8 cookies.

6. **Mohammed's Find:** Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier, so he finds 8 / 8 = 1 cookie.

7. **Umar's Find:** Mei and Elena found a total of 5 + 10 = 15 cookies. Umar finds two dozen more than that, which is 2 * 12 = 24 cookies.

8. **Total Found:** All together, they found 5 + 10 + 8 + 1 + 24 = 48 cookies.

9. **Cookies Hidden:** Since they found 48 cookies, there are still 132 - 48 = **84 cookies** hidden in the yard.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

**Explanation:**

My previous answers were incorrect because I struggled to keep track of the multiple steps and the different individuals finding cookies. I likely made arithmetic errors while calculating the total number of cookies found by each person and failed to account for the cookies Amelia ate initially.

**Error Keywords:**

- Multiple steps
- Word problem
- Quantity
- Addition
- Subtraction

**Instructions:**

1. **Calculate the initial number of cookies:** 11 dozen cookies * 12 cookies/dozen = 132 cookies.
2. **Subtract the cookies Amelia ate:** 132 cookies - 5 cookies = 127 cookies.
3. **Calculate cookies found by each person:**
    - Elena: 5 cookies
    - Mei: Elena * 2 = 10 cookies
    - Xavier: Mei - 2 = 8 cookies
    - Mohammed: Xavier / 8 = 1 cookie
    - Umar: (Elena + Mei) * 2 = 30 cookies
4. **Calculate the total number of cookies found:** 5 + 10 + 8 + 1 + 30 = 54 cookies.
5. **Subtract the found cookies from the remaining cookies:** 127 cookies - 54 cookies = 73 cookies.

**Advice:**

- Break down complex word problems into smaller, manageable steps.
- Clearly define variables and keep track of their values.
- Double-check all calculations and ensure they align with the problem's context.
- Use visual aids like diagrams or tables to organize information.



**Solution:**

There are **73** cookies still hidden in the yard.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

Now, look at this question:
Question: A janitor has to clean a building with 200 rooms. They have 10 days to get it done. It takes them 6 minutes per room. However, due to a recent injury, the janitor has become slower and it will take them twice as long to clean a room these days. If they work for 8 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?
Your initial answer was: A: Let's think step by step:

1. **Calculate the new time per room:** The janitor now takes twice as long to clean a room, so it takes 6 minutes * 2 = 12 minutes per room.

2. **Calculate the total cleaning time:**  They need to clean 200 rooms at 12 minutes per room, so the total cleaning time is 200 rooms * 12 minutes/room = 2400 minutes.

3. **Convert total cleaning time to hours:** There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total cleaning time is 2400 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 40 hours.

4. **Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning:** They work for 8 hours a day, and cleaning takes 40 hours total, so they spend 40 hours / 8 hours/day * 100% = 500% of their day cleaning. 


**Important Note:** The answer of 500% means the janitor spends more than a full day cleaning the building. This highlights that the given information is unrealistic.
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answer was incorrect because I failed to account for the fact that the janitor is cleaning the building over 10 days, not all at once. I mistakenly calculated the total cleaning time as if it were completed in a single day, leading to an unrealistic percentage.

**Error Keywords:**

- **Misinterpretation:** I misunderstood the time frame of the problem.
- **Calculation Error:** I incorrectly applied the cleaning time to the total workdays.
- **Logical Fallacy:** I drew an incorrect conclusion based on flawed calculations.

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Calculate the daily cleaning time:** The janitor cleans 8 hours a day, which is 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

2. **Calculate the daily cleaning room count:**  At 12 minutes per room, they can clean 480 minutes / 12 minutes/room = 40 rooms per day.

3. **Calculate the total cleaning days:**  They need 10 days to clean all 200 rooms.

4. **Calculate the total cleaning time:**  They clean 40 rooms per day for 10 days, totaling 40 rooms/day * 10 days = 400 rooms.

5. **Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning:**  They clean 40 rooms per day, and each room takes 12 minutes, so they spend 40 rooms * 12 minutes/room = 480 minutes cleaning per day. This is 480 minutes / 480 minutes/day * 100% = 100% of their day cleaning.

I incorrectly answered 500.0% because I failed to properly calculate the janitor's new cleaning time per room and then the total cleaning time. I also didn't accurately convert the cleaning time into a percentage of the workday. 

**Error Keywords:**

* **Time calculation:** Miscalculated cleaning time per room and total cleaning time.
* **Percentage calculation:** Incorrectly converted cleaning time to a percentage of the workday. 
* **Work rate:** Didn't adjust the work rate accurately for the slower cleaning speed.

## Solution:

1. **Calculate the new cleaning time per room:** 6 minutes * 2 = 12 minutes.
2. **Calculate the total cleaning time:** 200 rooms * 12 minutes/room = 2400 minutes.
3. **Convert cleaning time to hours:** 2400 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 40 hours.
4. **Calculate the percentage of the workday spent cleaning:** (40 hours / 8 hours/day) * 100% = 500%. 

**Wait! 500% doesn't make sense!** 

Let's revisit step 4. 500% means the janitor spends 5 times longer cleaning than their workday. This is impossible. 

The issue lies in how we calculated the percentage. We need to divide the cleaning time by the workday length, **not multiply**. 

5. **Correct percentage calculation:** (40 hours / 8 hours/day) * 100% = 50% 



## Instructions:

1. **Identify the relevant work rate:** Determine the baseline cleaning time per unit (e.g., room) and adjust it for any changes in efficiency. 
2. **Calculate the total work:** Multiply the adjusted cleaning time per unit by the total number of units. 
3. **Calculate the workday:** Determine the total available time for work each day. 
4. **Calculate the percentage:** Divide the total work time by the workday length and multiply by 100%. 

## Advice:

* **Double-check your calculations:** Always verify your answers, especially percentages, to ensure they make logical sense. 
* **Pay attention to units:** Ensure consistency in units throughout your calculations. 
* **Break down complex problems:** Divide complex problems into smaller, manageable steps. 
* **Visualize the problem:** Drawing diagrams or timelines can help clarify the relationships between time, work, and rates.

You are an expert in solving time and work problems.
You have incorrectly answered the following question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer similar questions in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.  Pay close attention to whether you correctly accounted for the janitor's reduced speed and the total time available.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. Consider keywords related to time calculations, work rate, and percentage calculations.
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.  Show your work clearly.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this type of problem in the future.  Focus on how to adjust for changing work rates and how to calculate percentages accurately.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).
[Example Input]
Question: A painter can finish a small house in 5 hours. It takes them 3 hours to paint a larger house. If they work for 6 hours a day, how many days will it take them to paint both houses?
Wrong answer: 1 day (The painter can paint both houses in 5 hours + 3 hours = 8 hours, so it will take 1 day)
---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the total time to paint both houses was simply the sum of the time for each house. I didn't consider the painter's daily work capacity.
Error Keywords:
- Time calculation
- Work rate
- Total time
Instructions:
1. Calculate the total work required for each house (e.g., 1 house / 5 hours = 0.2 houses per hour).
2. Calculate the combined work rate for both houses.
3. Divide the total work by the combined work rate to find the total time.
Advice:
- Always consider the work rate and the available time when solving time and work problems.
- Be careful not to simply add up times without considering the work involved.
Solution:
It will take the painter 2 days to paint both houses.
