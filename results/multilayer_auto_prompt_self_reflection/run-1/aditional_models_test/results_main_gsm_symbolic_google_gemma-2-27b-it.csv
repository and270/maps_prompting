**Wrong answer:** 

I calculated the total water in the peach drink as 20 * (1/5) = 4 liters. Then I calculated the total water in the lemon drink as 16 * (1/4) = 4 liters. I added these together to get 8 liters of water. Then I subtracted the spilled peach drink (5 liters) from the total volume (20 + 16 = 36 liters) to get 31 liters. Finally, I assumed the water content remained the same in the 31 liters, so the answer is 8 liters.

**Explanation:**

I made a mistake by assuming the water content remained the same after spilling the peach drink. I didn't account for the fact that the spilled portion also contained water.

**Error Keywords:**

- Proportionality
- Mixture Problems
- Incorrect Assumption
- Neglecting Component Change

**Instructions:**

1. Calculate the amount of water in each drink separately.
2. Calculate the total volume of the mixture after spilling.

- Neglecting Component Loss

**Instructions:**

1. Calculate the amount of water in each drink separately.
2. Calculate the total amount of water in the combined drinks before spilling.
3. Calculate the amount of water spilled along with the peach drink.
4. Subtract the spilled water from the total water to find the water in the remaining mixture.

**Advice:**

- Always consider the proportion of each component in a mixture.
- When a portion of a mixture is removed, consider the amount of each component lost.
- Double-check your assumptions and ensure they are valid for the given scenario.

**Solution:**

1. Water in peach drink: 20 liters * (1/5) = 4 liters
2. Water in lemon drink: 16 liters * (1/4) = 4 liters
3. Total water before spilling: 4 liters + 4 liters = 8 liters
4. Water spilled: 5 liters * (1/5) = 1 liter
5. Water remaining: 8 liters - 1 liter = 7 liters



Therefore, there are **7 liters** of water in the remaining 31 liters.

Now, look at this question:
Question: I have 20 liters of peach drink that are 1/5 water and I wish to add it to 16 liters of lemon drink that is 1/4 water. But as I pour it, I spill 5 liters of the peach drink. How much water is in the remaining 31 liters?

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","My previous answer was incorrect because I didn't account for the water lost when I spilled some of the peach drink. I simply assumed the water content remained proportional to the total volume, which is not true in this case.

Here's the corrected solution:

1. **Water in peach drink:** 20 liters * (1/5) = 4 liters
2. **Water in lemon drink:** 16 liters * (1/4) = 4 liters
3. **Total water before spilling:** 4 liters + 4 liters = 8 liters
4. **Water spilled:** 5 liters * (1/5) = 1 liter 
5. **Water remaining:** 8 liters - 1 liter = 7 liters


Therefore, there are **7 liters** of water in the remaining 31 liters.","## Adapted Self-Reflection Prompt:

You are an expert in solving mixture problems involving calculating the amount of a specific component.

You have incorrectly answered the following question:

**Question:** I have 20 liters of peach drink that are 1/5 water and I wish to add it to 16 liters of lemon drink that is 1/4 water. But as I pour it, I spill 5 liters of the peach drink. How much water is in the remaining 31 liters?

**Wrong answer:** 

I calculated the total water in the peach drink as 20 * (1/5) = 4 liters. Then I calculated the total water in the lemon drink as 16 * (1/4) = 4 liters. I added these together to get 8 liters of water. Then I subtracted the spilled peach drink (5 liters) from the total volume (20 + 16 = 36 liters) to get 31 liters. Finally, I assumed the water content remained the same in the 31 liters, so the answer is 8 liters.

**Explanation:**

I made a mistake by assuming the water content remained the same after spilling the peach drink. I didn't account for the fact that the spilled portion also contained water.

**Question:** According to its nutritional info, a bag of breads has 275 calories per serving. If a 300 ounces bag has 5 servings, how many ounces can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2360 and you have already consumed 1700 calories?

**Wrong answer:**  I calculated that each serving is 60 ounces (300 ounces / 5 servings). Then I figured out the remaining calories (2360 - 1700 = 660 calories) and divided that by the calories per serving (660 / 275 = 2.4 servings). Finally, I multiplied the number of servings by the ounces per serving (2.4 servings * 60 ounces/serving = 144 ounces).

**Explanation:**

I incorrectly assumed that the 300 ounces represented the size of a single serving. I should have first calculated the size of a single serving by dividing the total ounces by the number of servings.

**Error Keywords:**

- Misunderstanding of serving size
- Incorrect calculation of serving size
- Failure to prioritize information

**Instructions:**

1. **Identify the serving size:** Divide the total ounces in the bag by the number of servings.
2. **Calculate remaining calories:** Subtract the calories already consumed from the daily calorie target.
3. **Determine the number of servings:** Divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving.
4. **Calculate the total ounces:** Multiply the number of servings by the size of a single serving.

**Question:** According to its nutritional info, a bag of breads has 275 calories per serving. If a 300 ounces bag has 5 servings, how many ounces can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2360 and you have already consumed 1700 calories?

**Wrong answer:**  I calculated that each serving is 60 ounces (300 ounces / 5 servings). Then I figured out the remaining calories (2360 - 1700 = 660 calories) and divided that by the calories per serving (660 / 275 = 2.4 servings). Finally, I multiplied the number of servings by the ounces per serving (2.4 servings * 60 ounces/serving = 144 ounces).

**Explanation:**

I incorrectly assumed that the 300 ounces represented the size of a single serving. I should have first calculated the size of a single serving by dividing the total ounces by the number of servings.

**Error Keywords:**

- Misunderstanding of serving size
- Incorrect calculation of serving size
- Failure to prioritize information

**Instructions:**

1. **Identify the serving size:** Divide the total ounces in the bag by the number of servings.
2. **Calculate remaining calories:** Subtract the calories already consumed from the daily calorie target.
3. **Determine the number of servings:** Divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving.
4. **Calculate the total ounces:** Multiply the number of servings by the size of a single serving.

**Advice:**

- Carefully read the problem and identify all relevant information, including serving sizes and calorie counts.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps and solve each step systematically.
- Double-check your calculations and ensure that your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.

**Solution:**

1. **Serving size:** 300 ounces / 5 servings = 60 ounces per serving
2. **Remaining calories:** 2360 calories - 1700 calories = 660 calories
3. **Number of servings:** 660 calories / 275 calories/serving = 2.4 servings
4. **Total ounces:** 2.4 servings * 60 ounces/serving = 144 ounces

**1. Understand the Ratio:**

* The ratio 53:24 means that for every 53 teaspoons of sugar, Emma uses 24 cups of water.

**2.  Represent the Total Ratio Parts:**

* Add the two parts of the ratio: 53 + 24 = 77

**3. Determine the Value of One Ratio Part:**

* Emma used a total of 77 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, which is equal to the total ratio parts.
* Therefore, one ratio part represents 77 / 77 = 1 unit.

**4. Calculate the Teaspoons of Sugar:**

* The sugar part of the ratio is 53.
* Multiply the value of one ratio part by the sugar ratio: 1 * 53 = 53 teaspoons.



**Answer:** Emma used 53 teaspoons of sugar.",53.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

* Subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 50% - 25% = 25%


**Answer:** Umar is **25%** more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.",3.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

**1. Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**

* There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, and 6).
* There are 6 total possible outcomes.
* The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%.

**2. Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**

* The probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%.
* Since each roll is independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 25%.

**3. Finding the difference:**

* The difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row is 50% - 25% = 25%.

He paid the transfer fees that amount to 4% of the selling price and also paid a brokerage fee that is 3% of the selling price. If he also paid $520000 for the remaining loan amount of the condo, how much is Mr. Williams's net proceeds from selling the condo?",56600.0,"here's how to calculate Mr. Williams's net proceeds:

**1. Calculate the transfer fees:**

* Transfer fees = 4% of $620,000 
* Transfer fees = (4/100) * $620,000 = $24,800

**2. Calculate the brokerage fees:**

* Brokerage fees = 3% of $620,000
* Brokerage fees = (3/100) * $620,000 = $18,600

**3. Calculate the total expenses:**

* Total expenses = Transfer fees + Brokerage fees + Loan repayment
* Total expenses = $24,800 + $18,600 + $520,000 = $563,400

**4. Calculate the net proceeds:**

* Net proceeds = Selling price - Total expenses

Your initial answer was: Let's think step by step.

1. **Find the total number of people at the beginning:** 64 artists + 51 engineers = 115 people

2. **Calculate the number of people who left:** 115 people / 5 = 23 people

3. **Find the number of artists who left:** 64 artists - 26 artists = 38 artists

4. **Calculate the number of engineers who left:** 23 people - 38 artists = -15 engineers. This doesn't make sense, as we can't have negative engineers.  

**There seems to be an error in the problem statement. It's impossible for more artists to leave than the total number of people who left.**
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My answer was incorrect because I incorrectly assumed that the number of artists who left was equal to the number of people who left overall. This led to a logically impossible result (negative engineers). I failed to properly consider the proportion of artists and engineers leaving.

## Error Keywords:

- Logical error
- Proportionality error
- Misinterpretation of problem statement

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Find the total number of people at the beginning:** 64 artists + 51 engineers = 115 people

2. **Calculate the number of people who left:** 115 people / 5 = 23 people

3. **Calculate the proportion of engineers who left:** 51 engineers / 115 people = 0.443 (approximately)

4. **Calculate the number of engineers who left:** 23 people * 0.443 = 10.18 engineers. Since we can't have fractions of people, we'll round this down to 10 engineers.

5. **Calculate the number of engineers remaining:** 51 engineers - 10 engineers = 41 engineers.



## Instructions for Future Similar Problems:

1. **Carefully read the problem statement:** Identify key information like the initial number of each group and the proportion leaving.
2. **Calculate the total number of people:** Sum the initial number of each group.

You are an expert in solving word problems involving fractions and percentages.

You have incorrectly answered the following question:

**Question:** At the beginning of the conference, there were 64 artists and 51 engineers. After half an hour, one-fifth of the total number of people left. How many engineers are left if 26 artists stayed at the conference?

**Your Wrong Answer:**  

I first found the total number of people: 64 + 51 = 115. Then I calculated one-fifth of the total: 115 / 5 = 23. I subtracted this number from the total: 115 - 23 = 92. Since 26 artists stayed, I subtracted this from the remaining people: 92 - 26 = 66. Therefore, 66 engineers are left.

**Example Input:**

**Question:** A bakery had 80 cupcakes. They sold 3/4 of the cupcakes in the morning. In the afternoon, they baked 20 more cupcakes. How many cupcakes do they have now?

**Wrong Answer:** I multiplied the initial number of cupcakes by 3/4: 80 * (3/4) = 60. Then I added the newly baked cupcakes: 60 + 20 = 80. Therefore, they have 80 cupcakes now.

**Example Output:**

**Explanation:**

I incorrectly added the newly baked cupcakes to the number of cupcakes sold instead of adding them to the remaining cupcakes after the morning sales.

**Error Keywords:**

- Misunderstanding of word problem
- Incorrect order of operations
- Failure to identify remaining quantity

**Instructions:**

1. Carefully read the problem and identify the key information.
2. Calculate the quantity that left or was used.
3. Subtract this quantity from the initial amount to find the remaining quantity.
4. Add or subtract any additional quantities mentioned in the problem.

**Advice:**

- Pay close attention to the wording of the problem.
- Draw a diagram or use a table to visualize the information.
- Double-check your calculations and make sure they align with the problem's context.

**Solution:**

1. Cupcakes sold: 80 * (3/4) = 60
2. Cupcakes remaining: 80 - 60 = 20
3. Total cupcakes: 20 + 20 = 40. Therefore, they have 40 cupcakes now.

4. **Calculate the number of engineers remaining:** Since 26 artists stayed, the remaining people must be engineers: 92 people - 26 artists = 66 engineers.

**Solution:**

There are **66** engineers left at the conference.","## Adapted Self-Reflection Prompt:

You are an expert in solving word problems involving fractions and percentages.

You have incorrectly answered the following question:

**Question:** At the beginning of the conference, there were 64 artists and 51 engineers. After half an hour, one-fifth of the total number of people left. How many engineers are left if 26 artists stayed at the conference?

**Your Wrong Answer:**  

I first found the total number of people: 64 + 51 = 115. Then I calculated one-fifth of the total: 115 / 5 = 23. I subtracted this number from the total: 115 - 23 = 92. Since 26 artists stayed, I subtracted this from the remaining people: 92 - 26 = 66. Therefore, 66 engineers are left.

**Example Input:**

**Question:** A bakery had 80 cupcakes. They sold 3/4 of the cupcakes in the morning. In the afternoon, they baked 20 more cupcakes. How many cupcakes do they have now?

**Wrong Answer:** I multiplied the initial number of cupcakes by 3/4: 80 * (3/4) = 60. Then I added the newly baked cupcakes: 60 + 20 = 80. Therefore, they have 80 cupcakes now.

**Example Output:**

**Explanation:**

I incorrectly added the newly baked cupcakes to the number of cupcakes sold instead of adding them to the remaining cupcakes after the morning sales.

**Error Keywords:**

- Misunderstanding of word problem
- Incorrect order of operations
- Failure to identify remaining quantity

**Instructions:**

1. Carefully read the problem and identify the key information.
2. Calculate the quantity that left or was used.
3. Subtract this quantity from the initial amount to find the remaining quantity.
4. Add or subtract any additional quantities mentioned in the problem.

**Advice:**

- Pay close attention to the wording of the problem.
- Draw a diagram or use a table to visualize the information.
- Double-check your calculations and make sure they align with the problem's context.

**Solution:**

1. Cupcakes sold: 80 * (3/4) = 60
2. Cupcakes remaining: 80 - 60 = 20
3. Total cupcakes: 20 + 20 = 40. Therefore, they have 40 cupcakes now.



**Now, reflect on your incorrect answer to the original question using the above structure.**

**Error Keywords:**

- Budgeting
- Multiplication
- Subtraction
- Careful Reading

**Instructions:**

1. Calculate the total cost of the roller coaster rides: 8 rides * $11/ride = $88.
2. Calculate the total cost of laser tag for Sofia and one friend: $6/person * 2 people = $12.
3. Calculate the total cost for Sofia and one friend: $12 + $88 + $6 = $106.
4. Subtract the total cost from Sofia's budget: $200 - $106 = $94.
5. Divide the remaining budget by the cost of laser tag per person to find the number of friends: $94 / $6/person = 15.67.
6. Since Sofia can't invite a fraction of a friend, round down to the nearest whole number: 15 friends.

**Advice:**

- Carefully read the problem and identify all the costs involved, including costs for Sofia herself.
- Perform calculations in the correct order, paying attention to multiplication and addition.
- Double-check your work and consider if your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.

**Solution:**

The roller coaster costs $88 (8 rides * $11/ride). Laser tag for Sofia and one friend costs $12 ($6/person * 2 people). The total cost for Sofia and one friend is $106 ($12 + $88 + $6).  Sofia has $94 left ($200 - $106). She can invite 15 friends ($94 / $6/person).","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

5. **Solve for the number of friends:** 
   * Simplify the equation: $6 * (number of friends + 1) + $94 = $200
   * Subtract $94 from both sides: $6 * (number of friends + 1) = $106
   * Divide both sides by $6: number of friends + 1 = 17.67

**Answer:** Zahra has written a total of 984 letters.",984.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

* **Step 1: Writing the hiragana ten times** 
   Zahra writes 48 letters per full hiragana, and she writes it ten times, so she writes 48 * 10 = 480 letters.

* **Step 2: Writing one-fourth of the hiragana**
   One-fourth of the hiragana is 48 / 4 = 12 letters.

* **Step 3: Total letters written before rewriting**
   Before rewriting, Zahra has written a total of 480 + 12 = 492 letters.

* **Step 4: Rewriting everything**
   She rewrites all 492 letters.

* **Step 5: Total letters written**
   In total, Zahra has written 492 + 492 = 984 letters.

Question: Pavel is raising money for a conference. He has applied for help from the local charity, which has decided to cover 1/5 of the cost of the conference. How much money is Pavel missing if he has ₣70 and the conference costs ₣590?
Your initial answer was: Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the charity's contribution:** The charity covers 1/5 of the conference cost, so they will pay (1/5) * ₣590 = ₣118.

2. **Calculate the total amount Pavel needs:** The conference costs ₣590.

3. **Calculate how much money Pavel is missing:** Pavel needs ₣590 and has ₣70, so he is missing ₣590 - ₣70 = ₣520.


The answer is ₣520.
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

I incorrectly answered the question because I failed to account for the charity's contribution when calculating how much money Pavel was missing. I correctly calculated the charity's contribution and Pavel's remaining funds but then subtracted his funds from the total conference cost instead of subtracting his funds from the cost *after* the charity's contribution.

## Error Keywords:

- Reading Comprehension Error
- Inattention to Detail
- Failure to Account for All Information

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Calculate the charity's contribution:** The charity covers 1/5 of the conference cost, so they will pay (1/5) * ₣590 = ₣118.

2. **Calculate the amount Pavel needs to pay:** The conference costs ₣590, and the charity pays ₣118, so Pavel needs to pay ₣590 - ₣118 = ₣472.

3. **Calculate how much money Pavel is missing:** Pavel needs ₣472 and has ₣70, so he is missing ₣472 - ₣70 = ₣402.

**The answer is ₣402.**

## Instructions for Future Similar Problems:

Your initial answer was: A: Let's think step by step.

* **Day 1:** 6 people are infected.
* **Day 2:** Each of the 6 people infects 2 others, so 6 * 2 = 12 new people are infected. The total infected is now 6 + 12 = 18.
* **Day 3:** The 18 infected people each infect 2 others, so 18 * 2 = 36 new people are infected. The total infected is now 18 + 36 = 54.
* **Day 4:** The 54 infected people each infect 2 others, so 54 * 2 = 108 new people are infected. The total infected is now 54 + 108 = 162.


The answer is 162.
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My initial answer was incorrect because I failed to account for the fact that the newly infected individuals also contribute to the spread on subsequent days. I only considered the initial 6 people infecting others, neglecting the exponential growth of the infection.

## Error Keywords:

- Conceptual error
- Exponential growth misunderstanding
- Failure to account for compounding effects

## Corrected Solution:

* **Day 1:** 6 people are infected.
* **Day 2:** 6 people infect 2 others each, resulting in 6 * 2 = 12 new infections. Total infected: 6 + 12 = 18.
* **Day 3:** 18 people infect 2 others each, resulting in 18 * 2 = 36 new infections. Total infected: 18 + 36 = 54.
* **Day 4:** 54 people infect 2 others each, resulting in 54 * 2 = 108 new infections. Total infected: 54 + 108 = 162.

The answer is **162**.

## Instructions for Future Similar Problems:

1. **Identify the growth pattern:** Determine if the problem involves linear, exponential, or another type of growth.
2. **Consider all contributors:** In exponential growth, each newly infected individual contributes to the spread in subsequent periods.
3. **Break down the problem:** Calculate the new infections for each day separately and add them to the total infected.
4. **Double-check:** Ensure that you are accounting for all infected individuals in each calculation.

## General Advice:

- **Read carefully:** Pay close attention to the wording of the problem to understand the underlying growth pattern.
- **Visualize:** Draw a diagram or chart to help visualize the spread of the infection over time.
- **Test with smaller numbers:** Solve a simplified version of the problem with smaller numbers to verify your understanding of the growth pattern.

You are an expert in exponential growth problems.

You have incorrectly answered the following question:

A new infection infects 6 people. Every day, each infected person infects 2 others. How many people are infected after 4 days?

Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information to help you answer the same question in the future.

First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific.
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Fifth, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.

For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

[Example Input]
Question: A bacteria colony doubles in size every hour. If there are initially 5 bacteria, how many bacteria will there be after 3 hours?
Wrong answer: 5 * 2 * 3 = 30 bacteria. I simply multiplied the initial number by 2 three times.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I didn't account for the compounding effect of doubling. Each hour, the number of bacteria doubles based on the total from the previous hour, not the initial amount.
Error Keywords:
- Arithmetic Error
- Exponential Growth Misunderstanding
Instructions:
1. Identify the initial amount and the growth factor.
2. For each time period, multiply the previous total by the growth factor.
3. Calculate the total for each time period cumulatively.
Advice:
- Pay close attention to the wording of the problem to identify the growth pattern.
- Remember that exponential growth involves compounding, where the growth is based on the increasing total.

Solution:
Hour 1: 5 * 2 = 10 bacteria
Hour 2: 10 * 2 = 20 bacteria
Hour 3: 20 * 2 = 40 bacteria

   - The facility has 1900 rooms and 2/5 are occupied, so there are (2/5) * 1900 = 760 occupied rooms.

2. **Calculate the number of unoccupied rooms initially:**
   - The total number of rooms is 1900, and 760 are occupied, leaving 1900 - 760 = 1140 unoccupied rooms.

3. **Calculate the total number of patients admitted in two weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week, so two weeks have 2 * 7 = 14 days.
   -  80 patients are admitted each day, so in two weeks, 80 * 14 = 1120 patients are admitted.

4. **Calculate the total number of occupied rooms after two weeks:**
   - Initially, there were 760 occupied rooms.
   - After two weeks, 1120 more patients are admitted, bringing the total occupied rooms to 760 + 1120 = 1880.

5. **Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms after two weeks:**
   - The facility has 1900 rooms, and 1880 are now occupied, leaving 1900 - 1880 = 20 unoccupied rooms.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answer was incorrect because I mistakenly subtracted the number of plants Kimia already owned from the number of plants that could fit in the flower bed. This led to a negative result, implying she had too many plants. I should have added the number of plants she owns to the number that fit to determine the total needed.

## Error Keywords:

- **Sign Error:** Incorrectly using subtraction instead of addition.
- **Word Problem Misinterpretation:** Failing to accurately understand the relationship between the given information and the required calculation.

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Calculate the space each plant needs:** Each plant needs 3 feet (width) + 15 feet (spacing) = 18 feet of space.

2. **Calculate how many plants fit in the flower bed:** The flower bed is 180 feet long, and each plant needs 18 feet, so 180 / 18 = 10 plants can fit.

3. **Calculate the total number of plants needed:** Kimia already has 11 plants and the flower bed can hold 10, so she needs a total of 11 + 10 = 21 plants.

4. **Calculate how many plants Kimia needs to buy:** Kimia needs 21 plants and already owns 11, so she needs to buy 21 - 11 = 10 plants.

5. **Calculate the total cost:** Each plant costs ¥3, and she needs to buy 10, so the total cost is 10 * ¥3 = ¥30.

**The answer is ¥30.**

Now, look at this question:
Question: Comet Hale-Bopp orbits the sun every 55 years. Viktor's father saw the Comet when he was 23 years old. Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. How old was Viktor when he saw the Comet for the first time?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 69.0

Your previous reflection answers were:
Reflection 1: 179.0
Reflection 2: 23.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Comet Hale-Bopp Problem:

**Why the answer was incorrect:**

I incorrectly assumed Viktor saw the comet for the first time when he was three times his father's age. This ignores the fact that the comet has a 55-year orbit, meaning there would be multiple opportunities for Viktor to see it.

**Error Keywords:**

- Time Intervals
- Multiple Cycles
- Misunderstanding Problem Context

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Father's age at second sighting:** Viktor's father was 23 when he first saw the comet. Since the comet orbits every 55 years, he would see it again when he is 23 + 55 = 78 years old.

2. **Viktor's age at second sighting:** Viktor is three times his father's age when he sees the comet for the second time, meaning he is 78 * 3 = 234 years old.

3. **Viktor's age at first sighting:** Since the comet orbits every 55 years, Viktor would have seen it for the first time 55 years before his second sighting. Therefore, he was 234 - 55 = **179 years old** when he first saw the comet.

**Instructions for Future Solutions:**

1. **Identify the orbital period:** Determine the time interval between each appearance of the comet.
2. **Calculate ages at subsequent sightings:**  Use the orbital period to calculate the ages of individuals at each sighting.
3. **Consider multiple cycles:** Remember that the comet may appear multiple times within a person's lifetime.
4. **Double-check the context:** Ensure your answer aligns with the specific information provided in the problem.

**General Advice:**

- Carefully read the problem and identify all relevant time intervals and events.
- Draw a timeline to visualize the situation and track the comet's appearances.
- Pay close attention to the wording of the problem to avoid misinterpreting the context.
- Double-check your calculations and ensure your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.","## Adapted Self-Reflection Prompt:

You are an expert in solving word problems involving age and time intervals.

You have incorrectly answered the following question:

**Question:** Comet Hale-Bopp orbits the sun every 55 years. Viktor's father saw the Comet when he was 23 years old. Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. How old was Viktor when he saw the Comet for the first time?

**Wrong answer:** Viktor was 69 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

**[Example Input]**

**Question:** A grandfather clock chimes every hour. If the clock started chiming at 1:00 PM, how many times will it chime by 6:00 PM?

**Wrong answer:** The clock will chime 6 times.

**[Example Output]**

**Explanation:**

I only counted the chimes from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, forgetting to include the chime at 1:00 PM.

**Error Keywords:**

- Time Intervals
- Counting Events
- Off-by-One Error

**Instructions:**

1. Identify the starting and ending points in time.
2. Count the number of full intervals between the starting and ending points.
3. Remember to include the event at the starting point.

**Advice:**

- Carefully read the problem to identify all relevant time points.
- Draw a timeline to visualize the time intervals.
- Double-check your count to ensure you haven't missed any events.

**Solution:**

The clock will chime 6 times (1:00 PM, 2:00 PM, 3:00 PM, 4:00 PM, 5:00 PM, and 6:00 PM).

* Total ore mined: 260 kg/day * 31 days = 8060 kg


**Answer:** 20 trolls with titanium pickaxes can mine 8060 kgs of ore in a month.",8060.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

* **Nickel Pickaxe Output:** With a nickel pickaxe, a troll can mine twice the amount of ore with bare hands, so they mine 5 kg/day * 2 = 10 kg/day.

* **Titanium Pickaxe Output:** A titanium pickaxe allows a troll to mine 30% more than a nickel pickaxe.  30% of 10 kg/day is (30/100) * 10 kg/day = 3 kg/day. So, with a titanium pickaxe, a troll mines 10 kg/day + 3 kg/day = 13 kg/day.

* **One Troll's Monthly Output:** A single troll with a titanium pickaxe mines 13 kg/day * 31 days/month = 403 kg/month.

* **Twenty Trolls' Monthly Output:** 20 trolls each mining 403 kg/month will mine a total of 20 trolls * 403 kg/month/troll = 8060 kg/month.

For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

**[Example Input]**

**Question:**  David bought 3 notebooks for ₣2 each, a pen for ₣1.50, and a ruler for ₣0.75. He paid with a 20€ bill. How much change did he receive?

**Wrong answer:** David spent 3 * 2 + 1.50 + 0.75 = 8.25€. His change is 20 - 8.25 = 11.75€.

**[Example Output]**

**Explanation:** I forgot to convert the 20€ bill to ₣ before subtracting the total cost.

**Error Keywords:**

- Unit Conversion
- Subtraction

**Instructions:**

1. Convert all prices to the same currency.
2. Calculate the total cost of the items.
3. Subtract the total cost from the amount paid.

**Advice:**

- Always double-check the units of measurement.
- Pay attention to details like currency conversions.

**Solution:**

1. Convert 20€ to ₣ using the current exchange rate (let's assume 1€ = 1.20₣). 20€ * 1.20₣/€ = 24₣
2. Calculate the total cost: 3 * 2 + 1.50 + 0.75 = 8.25₣
3. Subtract the total cost from the amount paid: 24₣ - 8.25₣ = 15.75₣

main,gsm-symbolic,google/gemma-2-27b-it,There are 7 periods in the day for a normal student but Hiroshi has to take 2 extra classes. Each class is 35 minutes long. He goes to class for 4 days a week. He then spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,42.0,"here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate Hiroshi's total daily class time:**

* Normal classes: 7 periods
* Extra classes: 2 periods
* Total classes: 7 + 2 = 9 periods
* Class time per day: 9 periods * 35 minutes/period = 315 minutes

**2. Calculate Hiroshi's total weekly class time:**

* Class time per day: 315 minutes
* Days of class: 4 days
* Total weekly class time: 315 minutes/day * 4 days/week = 1260 minutes

**3. Calculate Hiroshi's extra learning time per day:**

* Three-sixths of weekly class time: (3/6) * 1260 minutes = 630 minutes
* Extra learning time per day: 630 minutes / 2 days = 315 minutes

**4. Calculate Hiroshi's total weekly learning time:**

* Weekly class time: 1260 minutes
* Weekly extra learning time: 630 minutes
* Total weekly learning time: 1260 minutes + 630 minutes = 1890 minutes

**5. Convert total weekly learning time to hours:**

* Total weekly learning time: 1890 minutes
* Minutes per hour: 60 minutes
* Total weekly learning time in hours: 1890 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 31.5 hours



**Answer:** Hiroshi spends 31.5 hours learning each week.",31.5,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Extra classes:** Hiroshi takes 2 extra classes * 35 minutes/class = 70 minutes of extra classes per day.

2. **Total daily class time:** He spends 7 periods/day * 35 minutes/period + 70 minutes = 305 minutes in class per day.

3. **Total weekly class time:** He spends 305 minutes/day * 4 days/week = 1220 minutes in class per week.

4. **Extra learning time per weekend day:** He spends 1220 minutes/week * (3/6) = 610 minutes on each weekend day.

5. **Total weekend learning time:** He spends 610 minutes/day * 2 days = 1220 minutes learning on the weekend.

6. **Total weekly learning time:** He spends 1220 minutes/week (weekday classes) + 1220 minutes/week (weekend learning) = 2440 minutes learning per week.

7. **Total weekly learning time in hours:** He spends 2440 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 40.67 hours learning per week.

You have incorrectly answered the following question:

**Question:** There are 7 periods in the day for a normal student but Hiroshi has to take 2 extra classes. Each class is 35 minutes long. He goes to class for 4 days a week. He then spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?

**Wrong answer:**  Hiroshi spends 2 hours in extra classes per day (2 classes * 35 minutes/class = 70 minutes = 1 hour and 10 minutes). That's 8 hours a week (1 hour and 10 minutes/day * 4 days). He spends 3/6 * 8 hours = 4 hours on the weekend. In total, he spends 12 hours learning per week (8 hours + 4 hours).

**Explanation:**

I incorrectly calculated the total time spent on extra classes per day and didn't account for the total weekly minutes before calculating the weekend study time.

**Error Keywords:**

- Time Calculation
- Unit Conversion
- Multi-step Problem
- Weekend Calculation

**Instructions:**

1. Calculate the total time spent on extra classes per day.
2. Calculate the total time spent on classes per week.
3. Calculate the total weekly minutes spent learning.
4. Calculate the weekend study time based on the fraction of weekly minutes.
5. Convert the total weekly minutes to hours.

**Advice:**

- Carefully read the problem and identify all the relevant information.
- Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
- Double-check your calculations and unit conversions.
- Pay attention to keywords like ""total,"" ""each,"" and ""per"" to ensure accurate calculations.

**Solution:**

1. Hiroshi spends 70 minutes in extra classes per day (2 classes * 35 minutes/class).
2. He spends 280 minutes on classes per week (70 minutes/day * 4 days).
3. His total weekly minutes spent learning are 280 minutes (weekday classes).
4. He spends 140 minutes on each weekend day (280 minutes * 3/6).
5. His total weekly learning time is 16 hours ( (280 minutes + 140 minutes + 140 minutes) / 60 minutes/hour).

Now, look at this question:
Question: There are 7 periods in the day for a normal student but Hiroshi has to take 2 extra classes. Each class is 35 minutes long. He goes to class for 4 days a week.

Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 40.67
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","Let's break down this problem step-by-step and see where the previous calculations went wrong.

**1. Calculate the extra class time per day:**

* Hiroshi takes 2 extra classes * 35 minutes/class = 70 minutes of extra classes per day.

**2. Calculate total daily class time:**

* A normal day has 7 periods, but we need to add Hiroshi's extra classes: 7 periods * (assuming each period is 35 minutes) + 70 minutes = 345 minutes.

**3. Calculate total weekly class time:**

* Hiroshi attends class for 4 days a week * 345 minutes/day = 1380 minutes.

**4. Calculate weekend study time:**

* Hiroshi spends 3/6 (which simplifies to 1/2) of his weekly class time on each weekend day: 1380 minutes * (1/2) = 690 minutes per weekend day.

**5. Calculate total weekly learning time:**

* Total weekly learning time is weekday classes + weekend study: 1380 minutes + (690 minutes/day * 2 days) = 1380 minutes + 1380 minutes = 2760 minutes.

**6. Convert total weekly learning time to hours:**

* 2760 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 46 hours.



**Therefore, Hiroshi spends 46 hours learning per week.**

**Reflection on Previous Errors:**

The previous answers were incorrect because they failed to account for the total time spent in class each day, including the normal 7 periods. They also incorrectly calculated the weekend study time based on the weekday class time only, instead of the total weekly class time.","## Adapted Self-Reflection Prompt:

You have incorrectly answered the following question:

**Question:** Ali collects garbage from 4 different apartment complexes. The first 3 have 300 apartments each and the last one is 35% bigger than the other 3 combined. Ali collects garbage 3 times a week from each place and he gets paid €0.4 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?

**Wrong answer:**  I calculated the total number of apartments in the first three complexes as 900 (3 complexes * 300 apartments/complex). Then I added 35% of 900 to find the size of the last complex (315 apartments). Finally, I multiplied the total number of apartments (1215) by 3 collections/week and €0.4/collection to get €1458.

**Explanation:**

I made a mistake when calculating the size of the last complex. I should have calculated the size of the first three complexes combined (900 apartments) and then added 35% of that number.

You have incorrectly answered the following question:

**Question:** Gabriel caught 5 trouts last Friday, the first trout he caught weighs 43 kilograms, the second trout he caught weighs 45 kilograms, and the last trout he caught weighs 28 kilograms. If a kilogram of trout costs ¥0.5, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?

**Wrong answer:** I added the weights of the three trouts mentioned (43 + 45 + 28 = 116 kilograms) and multiplied that by ¥0.5, getting ¥58. I forgot to consider the other two trouts.

**Explanation:**

I failed to account for all the trouts Gabriel caught. I only considered the weights of the first, second, and last trout, neglecting the other two.

**Step 1: Calculate the popping rate in the second 22 seconds**

* The popping rate doubles in the second 22 seconds: 30 kernels * 2 = 60 kernels

**Step 2: Calculate the popping rate in the third 22 seconds**

* The popping rate quadruples in the third 22 seconds: 30 kernels * 4 = 120 kernels

**Step 3: Calculate the popping rate in the final 22 seconds**

* The popping rate halves in the final 22 seconds: 120 kernels / 2 = 60 kernels

**Step 4: Calculate the number of kernels that pop from residual heat**

* A quarter of the kernels from the final 22 seconds pop: 60 kernels / 4 = 15 kernels

**Step 5: Calculate the total number of popped kernels**

* Add up the kernels from each 22-second interval and the residual heat: 30 + 60 + 120 + 60 + 15 = 285 kernels

How many pieces of popcorn does Oscar have to eat?",285.0,"here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the popping rate in the second 22 seconds**

* The popping rate doubles in the second 22 seconds: 30 kernels * 2 = 60 kernels

**Step 2: Calculate the popping rate in the third 22 seconds**

* The popping rate quadruples in the third 22 seconds: 30 kernels * 4 = 120 kernels

**Step 3: Calculate the popping rate in the final 22 seconds**

* The popping rate halves in the final 22 seconds: 120 kernels / 2 = 60 kernels

**Step 4: Calculate the number of kernels that pop from residual heat**

* A quarter of the kernels from the final 22 seconds pop: 60 kernels / 4 = 15 kernels

**Step 5: Calculate the total number of popped kernels**

* Add up the kernels from each 22-second interval and the residual heat: 30 + 60 + 120 + 60 + 15 = 285 kernels
