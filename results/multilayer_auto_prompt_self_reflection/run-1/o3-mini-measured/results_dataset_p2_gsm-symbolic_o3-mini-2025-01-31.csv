p2,gsm-symbolic,o3-mini-2025-01-31,"Sophia went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, and 60 mini cheesecakes. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, calculate the cost of the donuts.  
   - Sophia bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen.  
   - Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, she bought 60/12 = 5 dozens.  
   - The total cost for donuts is 5 × $19 = $95.

2. Next, calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes.  
   - She bought 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen.  
   - That means she bought 60/12 = 5 dozens.  
   - The total cost for mini cupcakes is 5 × $33 = $165.

3. Let the cost per dozen for mini cheesecakes be x dollars.  
   - Sophia bought 60 mini cheesecakes, which is also 60/12 = 5 dozens.  
   - Therefore, the total cost for mini cheesecakes is 5x dollars.

4. Now, add up the total cost before the discount.  
   - Total undiscounted cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes  
   - Total = $95 + $165 + 5x = $260 + 5x

5. Sophia received a 20% discount on the total.  
   - This means she paid 80% of the original total.  
   - So, 0.8 × (260 + 5x) = 1500 dollars.

6. Solve the equation:  
   - 0.8(260 + 5x) = 1500  
   - Divide both sides by 0.8: 260 + 5x = 1500 / 0.8 = 1875  
   - Subtract 260 from both sides: 5x = 1875 - 260 = 1615  
   - Divide by 5: x = 1615 / 5 = 323

The cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen is $323.",323.0,1

The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?",350.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, determine the calories per gram of popcorn.  
 • A bag of popcorn (300 grams) has 6 servings, and each serving is 200 calories.  
 • Total calories in the bag = 6 × 200 = 1200 calories.  
 • Therefore, calories per gram = 1200 calories / 300 grams = 4 calories per gram.

2. Next, calculate each person’s healthy daily calorie target using 15 calories per pound of body weight.  
 • Hiroshi’s target = 15 × 220 = 3300 calories.  
 • Tara’s target = 15 × 140 = 2100 calories.

3. Find the remaining calories each needs after subtracting what they have already consumed (and for Hiroshi, also subtracting calories burned).  
 • Hiroshi:  
  - Already consumed = 1100 calories.  
  - Calories burned = 200 calories.  
  - Effective consumption = 1100 - 200 = 900 calories.  
  - Remaining calories = 3300 - 900 = 2400 calories.  
 • Tara:  
  - Already consumed = 900 (food) + 200 (ice cream) = 1100 calories.  
  - Remaining calories = 2100 - 1100 = 1000 calories.

4. Convert the remaining calories needed into grams of popcorn using the conversion factor (4 calories per gram).  
 • Hiroshi needs: 2400 calories / 4 = 600 grams of popcorn.  
 • Tara needs: 1000 calories / 4 = 250 grams of popcorn.

5. Find the difference in grams between Hiroshi and Tara.  
 • Difference = 600 grams - 250 grams = 350 grams.

Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Daphne remain with?",335.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Daphne has window ledges with potted plants. She has 8 plants on each of her 56 window ledges, so she has 8 × 56 = 448 plants on the ledges.
2. Two days ago, she received an additional 23 potted plants.
3. Yesterday, she purchased another 200 plants at a discount.
4. Adding these together, the total number of plants she has is 448 + 23 + 200 = 671.
5. Tomorrow, she plans to give 6 plants from each of her 56 ledges to her friends and family, which totals 6 × 56 = 336 plants.

However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. We are told that during the first hour the fog bank covers 4 miles. This means its initial speed is 4 miles per hour (mph).  
2. The city is 80 miles wide, so covering ¼ of the city means covering 80/4 = 20 miles.  
3. In the first 60 minutes (or 1 hour), the fog bank covers 4 miles.  
4. After the first hour, the wind speed is halved. This means the fog bank’s new speed becomes 4 mph ÷ 2 = 2 mph.  
5. The distance remaining to cover after the first hour is 20 miles – 4 miles = 16 miles.  
6. At the slower speed of 2 mph, covering 16 miles takes 16 miles ÷ 2 mph = 8 hours.  
7. Converting 8 hours to minutes gives 8 × 60 = 480 minutes.

If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?",6.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.
1. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Santiago watched 4 hours each night. So, the total for these two days is 4 + 4 = 8 hours.
2. On Friday, he watched one 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. Since 45 minutes is 0.75 hours, Friday’s total is 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.
3. On Saturday, he watched three 2-hour episodes, which adds up to 3 × 2 = 6 hours.
4. On Sunday, he watched three episodes of 15 minutes each. Since 15 minutes is 0.25 hours, that totals 3 × 0.25 = 0.75 hours.
5. Adding these up: 8 (Tue & Wed) + 3.75 (Fri) + 6 (Sat) + 0.75 (Sun) = 18.5 hours.
6. Since he watched 20 hours of TV in total, on Thursday he must have watched 20 − 18.5 = 1.5 hours.
7. On Thursday, he watched episodes that were each 15 minutes long, and 15 minutes is 0.25 hours. To find the number of episodes, divide 1.5 hours by 0.25 hours per episode: 1.5 / 0.25 = 6 episodes.

She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.
1. Let S be the number of teaspoons of sugar, W be the number of cups of water, M be the number of tablespoons of milk, and C be the number of tablespoons of heavy cream.
2. According to the problem, the ratio of sugar to water is 54:27, which simplifies to 2:1. This means S = 2W or equivalently, W = S/2.
3. It is given that there are 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, so the amount of milk equals the amount of water. Therefore, M = W = S/2.
4. The recipe also states that 2 tablespoons of heavy cream are used for every teaspoon of sugar, hence C = 2S.
5. The total amount of ingredients used (sugar, water, cream, and milk) is 240 units (teaspoons, cups, or tablespoons, respectively). Therefore:
  S + W + C + M = 240
6. Substitute the expressions from steps 2–4 into the total:
  S + (S/2) + 2S + (S/2) = 240

1. Aisha initially bought a package containing an unknown number of forks, which we can call x.
2. Her husband then gave her a package of 8 forks.
3. Later, the guests brought 2 packs of forks, each containing 6 forks. This adds 2 × 6 = 12 forks.
4. So, before any were discarded or set aside, the total number of forks Aisha had was x + 8 + 12 = x + 20.
5. While making the stuffed peppers, Aisha used 16 forks for sampling, but she later threw away 6 defective forks. (The phrasing suggests that only the defective ones were permanently lost.)
6. Therefore, after discarding the 6 defective forks, the total number of forks available became (x + 20) – 6.

In the span of two years, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?",1764.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, determine the banana yield per square yard.  
• The problem states there are 36 bananas per (4/5) square yard.  
• To find bananas per 1 square yard, divide 36 by (4/5):  
 36 ÷ (4/5) = 36 × (5/4) = 45 bananas per square yard.

2. Calculate the banana yield for Ravi’s field per harvest.  
• Ravi’s banana field is 10 square yards.  
• So, per harvest, the field produces 10 × 45 = 450 bananas.

3. Determine the number of harvests in two years.  
• Ravi harvests every 4 months and two years is 24 months.  
• Number of harvests = 24 ÷ 4 = 6 harvests.

4. Compute the total banana harvest over two years.  
• Total bananas = 450 bananas/harvest × 6 harvests = 2700 bananas.

5. Next, find the apricot yield per harvest.  
• Ravi’s apricot field is 13 square yards, and each square yard yields 12 apricots.  
• Per harvest, the apricot field produces 13 × 12 = 156 apricots.

6. Calculate the total apricot harvest over two years.  
• Total apricots = 156 apricots/harvest × 6 harvests = 936 apricots.

1. First, calculate the cost of each type of item:
   - Folders: 12 folders × $4.75 = $57.00  
   - Erasers: 8 erasers × $14.50 = $116.00  
   - Bond paper: 1 ream = $11.00  
   - Pencils: 7 pencils × $8.00 = $56.00

2. Now, add up all the costs:
   Total cost = $57.00 + $116.00 + $11.00 + $56.00 = $240.00

3. If Arjun does NOT become a member, he receives a 5% discount:
   - Discount = 5% of $240.00 = 0.05 × $240.00 = $12.00  
   - Total cost with non-member discount = $240.00 − $12.00 = $228.00

4. If Arjun becomes a member, he pays a one-time fee of $20 and receives a 20% discount:
   - Discount = 20% of $240.00 = 0.20 × $240.00 = $48.00

1. For a twenty-sided die, the total number of outcomes on each roll is 20.

2. To roll a number greater than 5, the outcomes are 6, 7, ..., 20. There are 15 outcomes (since 20 - 5 = 15). So, the probability on one roll is 15/20 = 75%, or 0.75.

Step 1: Determine the number of golf balls.  
The juggler has 160 balls, and 1/5 of them are golf balls.  
So, golf balls = 160 × 1/5 = 32.

Step 2: Determine the number of tennis balls.  
Since the rest of the balls are tennis balls, tennis balls = 160 − 32 = 128.

Step 3: Count the marked golf balls.  
Of the 32 golf balls, 1/2 are yellow.  
Yellow golf balls = 32 × 1/2 = 16.

After a visit to the vet, Jamal discovered that half of his unspotted puppies actually have spots that were not visible before. What percentage of all the puppies have spots?",90.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Jamal's Dog:
   • Total puppies = 131.
   • Initially spotted puppies = 23.
   • Unspotted puppies = 131 - 23 = 108.
   • After the vet’s visit, half of the unspotted puppies (108 / 2 = 54) are found to have spots.
   • Updated spotted puppies for Jamal = 23 + 54 = 77.

2. Gabriel's Dog:
   • Total puppies = 47.
   • Spotted puppies = 13.

3. Yuki's Dogs:
   • Yuki has 54 dogs.
   • Each dog has 13 puppies, and all of them have spots.
   • Total spotted puppies for Yuki = 54 * 13 = 702.

4. Now, let's sum up:
   • Total spotted puppies = Jamal's (77) + Gabriel's (13) + Yuki's (702) = 77 + 13 + 702 = 792.
   • Total puppies overall = Jamal's (131) + Gabriel's (47) + Yuki's (702) = 131 + 47 + 702 = 880.

5. To find the percentage of all puppies that have spots:
   • Percentage = (Spotted puppies / Total puppies) * 100 = (792 / 880) * 100.
   • Simplify the fraction: 792/880 = 99/110 = 0.9.

1. First, calculate the weight for each type of item:

• Apples: The farmer buys four boxes weighing 3 kg each.
  Weight = 4 × 3 = 12 kg.

• Cucumbers: The farmer buys twelve bags weighing 6 kg each.
  Weight = 12 × 6 = 72 kg.

• Hay: The farmer buys thirty-four packs weighing 39 kg each.
  Weight = 34 × 39 = 1326 kg.

On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?",45.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. For the first shark:
   - The shark is 40 feet long.
   - It initially has 18 remoras attached.
   - 1/6 of the 18 remoras swim away. Since 1/6 × 18 = 3, the remaining remoras = 18 - 3 = 15.
   - Each remaining remora is 16 inches long. Converting inches to feet: 16 inches = 16/12 = 4/3 feet.
   - The total length covered by remoras is 15 × (4/3) feet = 20 feet.
   - The percentage of the shark's body length covered is (20 feet / 40 feet) × 100 = 50%.

2. For the second shark:

Unfortunately, 2 tables break. Carlos then eats one-fifth of all the almonds. How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?",14.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Each bowl holds 24 almonds, and each table holds three times that, which is 3 × 24 = 72 almonds.
2. Initially, Carlos has 7 bowls and 3 tables. However, 2 tables break, leaving him with only 1 working table.
3. The capacity of his remaining containers is:
  • Bowls: 7 × 24 = 168 almonds  
  • Table: 1 × 72 = 72 almonds  
  Total capacity = 168 + 72 = 240 almonds.
4. Carlos starts with 720 almonds, but he then eats one-fifth of them. The remaining almonds are 720 - (1/5 × 720) = 720 - 144 = 576 almonds.
5. To hold 576 almonds, he must increase his container capacity using additional bowls. Let n be the number of extra bowls needed. Each extra bowl holds 24 almonds, so the new total capacity will be 240 + 24n.
6. We set up the equation:
  240 + 24n = 576
  24n = 576 - 240 = 336

1. Diego is currently 19 years old.

2. In 9 years, Aisha will be 2 times as old as Diego is now. That means:
  Aisha's age in 9 years = 2 × 19 = 38.

The store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs; any additional rice is sold at the regular price. Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2. How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The normal cost of rice is ¥15 per kg. The more expensive brand costs 20% more, so its cost per kg is:
   15 + (0.20 × 15) = 15 + 3 = ¥18 per kg.

2. Mohammed uses 3 kgs per day and needs a week’s worth. For 7 days, he needs:
   3 kg/day × 7 days = 21 kgs of rice.

3. The store offers a 40% discount on rice for up to 10 kgs. The discounted price per kg is:
   18 - (0.40 × 18) = 18 - 7.2 = ¥10.8 per kg.
   So, for the first 10 kgs, he pays:
   10 kg × ¥10.8 = ¥108.

4. For the remaining rice, he buys:
   21 kg – 10 kg = 11 kgs at the regular price of ¥18 per kg.
   So, the cost for these 11 kgs is:
   11 kg × ¥18 = ¥198.

The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break.

How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. After 6 weeks, Jasmine has 36 signatures. This means her average per week was 36 ÷ 6 = 6 signatures.
2. For the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine’s collection decreases by 5 signatures per week due to only being available on weekends. Thus, her new weekly collection will be 6 – 5 = 1 signature.
3. Over 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect 1 signature per week, adding 1 × 2 = 2 signatures. So by the end of the break, Jasmine's total becomes 36 + 2 = 38 signatures.
4. Mia already has 31 signatures. Let x represent the number of signatures Mia collects per week for the remaining 2 weeks. Over 2 weeks, she will collect 2x signatures, making her total 31 + 2x.
5. Together, their totals need to reach 145 signatures. Setting up the equation:  
  Jasmine's total + Mia's total = 145  
  38 + (31 + 2x) = 145

  38 + 31 = 69, so the equation becomes 69 + 2x = 145.

They have a total of 246 minutes.

1. From home to the corner (where the cinema is) takes 16 minutes.

1. Leon makes a total of 48 ice cubes. He already made 10 giant, 12 medium, and 14 small cubes.  
  Number of tiny cubes = 48 - (10 + 12 + 14) = 48 - 36 = 12.

2. Next, we calculate the water used for each size:
  • Giant cubes: 10 * 12 ounces = 120 ounces.  
  • Medium cubes: 12 * 5 ounces = 60 ounces.  
  • Small cubes: 14 * ½ ounce = 14 * 0.5 = 7 ounces.  
  • Tiny cubes: Since a tiny cube is half the size of a small cube, it takes ¼ ounce. Thus, 12 * ¼ ounce = 12 * 0.25 = 3 ounces.

  • 13 students like to play football.
  So, the total for these hobbies is 69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103 students.

2. The rest of the students like to either play video games or bake. Since there are 160 students in total, the number of students with these two hobbies is 160 - 103 = 57.

3. Let’s denote:

Arash eats 5 pieces per day.
Ava eats twice as much as Arash, so she eats 2 × 5 = 10 pieces per day.
DeShawn eats two times as much as Ava, so he eats 2 × 10 = 20 pieces per day.

Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks.",530.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, determine the initial room counts in each category for the 1900 rooms:
  • Occupied rooms: 1/4 of 1900 = 1900/4 = 475.
  • Out-of-service rooms: 1/4 of 1900 = 1900/4 = 475.
  • Rooms that are in service (available for patient occupancy): 1900 − (475 + 475) = 1900 − 950 = 950.

2. Next, note that due to the pandemic, 20 patients are admitted each day. Over 3 weeks (which is 21 days), the facility admits:
  20 patients/day × 21 days = 420 patients.

3. These 420 patients will occupy some of the rooms that were previously unoccupied in service. So, the new total number of occupied rooms becomes:
  Initial occupied rooms + newly admitted patients = 475 + 420 = 895.

4. Finally, to find the total number of unoccupied rooms, note that a room is unoccupied whether it is available (in service but empty) or out of service. Therefore, subtract the occupied rooms from the total room count:

On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday and 21 boxes of apricot pie. On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?",796.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, determine the number of boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday for each item.

 • From the problem, on Wednesday Faisal sold 27 boxes of muffins.  
 • It is stated that on Wednesday he sold “13 fewer boxes of apricot pie, than on Thursday.” This means the number of apricot pie boxes on Wednesday equals (apricot pie boxes on Thursday) – 13.  
 • On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than he did on Wednesday. Since Wednesday muffins = 27, then Thursday muffins = 27 + 11 = 38.  
 • The problem also tells us that on Thursday he sold 21 boxes of apricot pie.

2. Now, use the information for apricot pies on Wednesday.  
 • Since Thursday’s apricot pies = 21, then Wednesday’s apricot pies = 21 – 13 = 8.

3. Next, determine the sales on Friday.  
 • The problem says that on Friday, he sold “as much as he did in the past two days combined.” A natural interpretation is that for each item on Friday he sold as many boxes as the total sold on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.  
  – Friday muffins = Wednesday muffins + Thursday muffins = 27 + 38 = 65.  
  – Friday apricot pies = Wednesday apricot pies + Thursday apricot pies = 8 + 21 = 29.  
 • (Thus, the total boxes on Friday = 65 + 29 = 94.)

4. Now, compute the earnings per box for each product.  
 • Each muffin box costs ₺9.  
 • Each apricot pie box costs ₺21.

5. Calculate earnings for each day.

 • Wednesday:  
  – Muffins: 27 boxes × ₺9 = ₺243  
  – Apricot pies: 8 boxes × ₺21 = ₺168  
  – Total for Wednesday = ₺243 + ₺168 = ₺411

 • Thursday:  
  – Muffins: 38 boxes × ₺9 = ₺342  
  – Apricot pies: 21 boxes × ₺21 = ₺441  
  – Total for Thursday = ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783

 • Friday:  
  – Muffins: 65 boxes × ₺9 = ₺585  
  – Apricot pies: 29 boxes × ₺21 = ₺609  
  – Total for Friday = ₺585 + ₺609 = ₺1194

6. Now, find the overall earnings for the three days.  
 • Total earnings = ₺411 (Wednesday) + ₺783 (Thursday) + ₺1194 (Friday) = ₺2388

7. Finally, compute the average daily earning over the 3 days.

How much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",31.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. We first find how many plants can be planted. Each plant occupies 3 meters, and between every two plants there must be an additional 12 meters. (Note that there is no need for extra gap at the very start of the bed.)

2. If n plants are arranged in a row, then the total space they take up is:
  Total length = (n × 3) + ((n – 1) × 12)  
    = 3n + 12n – 12

Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.,163.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Washing:  
Each clam takes 12 seconds to wash. For 150 clams, the total washing time is 150 × 12 = 1800 seconds. Converting that to minutes gives 1800 ÷ 60 = 30 minutes.

2. Peeling:  
Olga peels at a rate of 6 clams per minute. To peel 150 clams, she needs 150 ÷ 6 = 25 minutes.

3. Break:  
After peeling, she takes a 13‑minute break.

4. Sautéing:  
She sautées 30 clams in 19 minutes. For 150 clams, the total time is (150 ÷ 30) × 19 = 5 × 19 = 95 minutes.

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 50% for the second half. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?",1755.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, determine the normal daily consumption before any diet:
 • The uncle eats 10 pizzas per day.
 • His spouse eats 20 pizzas per day.
 • Their combined consumption is 10 + 20 = 30 pizzas per day.
 • The grandchild eats two-fourths (which is the same as one-half) of the combined number of pizzas. That amounts to 1/2 × 30 = 15 pizzas per day.
 • Therefore, the total pizzas eaten per day normally is 10 + 20 + 15 = 45 pizzas.

2. Calculating consumption in the first month (normal consumption):
 • Assuming the month has 30 days, the family eats 45 pizzas/day × 30 days = 1,350 pizzas.

3. Calculating consumption in the second month (with the diet):
 a. For the first half of the month (first 15 days):
  • Their consumption is reduced by 60%, so they eat only 40% of their normal amount.
  • Daily consumption becomes 45 × 0.4 = 18 pizzas.
  • Over 15 days, they eat 18 × 15 = 270 pizzas.
 b. For the second half of the month (remaining 15 days):
  • They reduce their already reduced consumption by an additional 50%. This means they now eat only 50% of the 18 pizzas per day.
  • Daily consumption becomes 18 × 0.5 = 9 pizzas.
  • Over 15 days, they eat 9 × 15 = 135 pizzas.
 c. Total consumption in the second month is 270 + 135 = 405 pizzas.

4. Finally, add the pizzas from both months:
 • First month: 1,350 pizzas

3. First, find the total number of seats that are not available for friends and family by adding these numbers together:
   700 + 450 + 50 = 1200.
4. Next, subtract this total from the arena's capacity to see how many seats remain:

1. Every day, Mohammed receives 30 emails.
2. Out of these, 20% do not require a response. That means 20% of 30 = 0.2 × 30 = 6 emails do not need a reply.
3. So, the remaining emails that might need a response are 30 − 6 = 24 emails.
4. However, from these 24 emails, Mohammed can only respond to 2 less than half of them. First, half of 24 is 24 ÷ 2 = 12, and then subtracting 2 gives 12 − 2 = 10 emails that he can respond to on a regular day.
5. Mohammed works 6 days a week. But on the last day, he works overtime and can respond to 10% more emails than usual. So on that day, he responds to 10 + (10% of 10) = 10 + 1 = 11 emails.

1. The total walk is 24 miles: 10 miles on the beach and 14 miles on the sidewalk.
2. Originally, let the beach speed be v. Then the sidewalk speed is 2v.
3. However, due to her injury, both speeds are halved. Thus, the effective beach speed is v/2, and the effective sidewalk speed is (2v)/2 = v.
4. We know that 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. Converting 50 minutes to hours gives 50/60 = 5/6 hour.
5. On the beach, she covers 10 miles in 5/6 hour. Therefore, her effective beach speed is calculated as:
  Speed = Distance ÷ Time = 10 ÷ (5/6) = 10 × (6/5) = 12 miles per hour.
6. Since her effective beach speed is v/2 and we have 12 mph, we can find her original beach speed:

Noah gives one-fifth of the made popcorn to his brother Luca. How many more pieces of popcorn does Noah have to eat than his brother?",399.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. In the first 10 seconds, 70 kernels pop.
2. In the next 10 seconds, 2 times the initial amount pop: 2 × 70 = 140 kernels.
3. In the next 10 seconds, 4 times the initial amount pop: 4 × 70 = 280 kernels.
4. In the final 10 seconds, the popping slows to half the rate of the previous 10 seconds: ½ × 280 = 140 kernels.
5. After taking the skillet off the heat, additional kernels pop from residual heat: a quarter of the final 10-second amount, which is ¼ × 140 = 35 kernels.
6. Now, add all the popped kernels together: 70 + 140 + 280 + 140 + 35 = 665 kernels.
7. Noah gives one-fifth of the total popcorn to his brother Luca: ⅕ × 665 = 133 kernels.
8. The remaining popcorn for Noah is: 665 – 133 = 532 kernels.
9. To find how many more kernels Noah has than Luca, subtract Luca’s share from Noah’s: 532 – 133 = 399.

The answer is 399.",399.0,1

1. The building is made with:
   - 5 white bricks.
   - Twice as many orange bricks as white, so 2 × 5 = 10 orange bricks.
   - An unknown number of green bricks.

2. The total number of bricks is given as 30. So, we add the bricks together:
   5 (white) + 10 (orange) + green bricks = 30.

3. Solve for the green bricks:
   5 + 10 + green bricks = 30  
   15 + green bricks = 30  
   green bricks = 30 - 15 = 15.

4. Now, to find the percentage of bricks that are green:
   Percentage = (number of green bricks / total bricks) × 100  
   Percentage = (15 / 30) × 100 = 0.5 × 100 = 50%.

The answer is 50%.",50.0,1

Olivia, who is younger than Bodhi but older than Keisha, will be 42 in 7 years. How much younger is Keisha than the average age of all three?",18.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.
1. Olivia will be 42 in 7 years, so her current age is 42 - 7 = 35.
2. Olivia is 24 years younger than Bodhi, which means Bodhi's age is 35 + 24 = 59.
3. Olivia is 15 years older than Keisha, so Keisha's age is 35 - 15 = 20.
4. The average age of Olivia, Bodhi, and Keisha is (35 + 59 + 20) / 3 = 114 / 3 = 38.
5. Keisha is 20 years old, which is 38 - 20 = 18 years younger than the average age.
The answer is 18.",18.0,1
