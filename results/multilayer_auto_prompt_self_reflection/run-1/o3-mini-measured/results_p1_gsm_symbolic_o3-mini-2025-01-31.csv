How much was the total cost if she received 25% discount on all purchases?",582.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.
1. Beatriz bought 6 dozen croissants at $19 per dozen. So, the cost for croissants is 6 * $19 = $114.
2. She bought 4 dozen macarons at $77 per dozen. So, the cost for macarons is 4 * $77 = $308.
3. She bought 3 dozen brownies at $118 per dozen. So, the cost for brownies is 3 * $118 = $354.
4. The total cost before the discount is $114 + $308 + $354 = $776.
5. With a 25% discount, she pays 75% of the total cost. So, the final cost is 0.75 * $776 = $582.

But as I pour it, I spill 7 liters of the mango drink. To make up for that, I add 7 liters of water to the mix. What percentage of the final mix is water?",50.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Originally, 16 liters of mango drink is one-ninth water. The water content in the mango drink is (1/9) × 16 = 16/9 liters.  
2. However, 7 liters of the mango drink are spilled. Since the drink is uniformly mixed, the spilled 7 liters also contain water in the same proportion (1/9 water and 8/9 non-water).  
3. The remaining mango drink is 16 – 7 = 9 liters. The water portion in the remaining mango drink is (1/9) × 9 = 1 liter, and the non-water portion is 9 – 1 = 8 liters.  
4. Next, 14 liters of apple drink is one-half water, so it contains 14 × (1/2) = 7 liters water and 7 liters non-water.  
5. Now, after mixing the mango and apple drinks, the total volume is 9 (mango) + 14 (apple) = 23 liters. The water content at this stage is 1 (from mango) + 7 (from apple) = 8 liters.  
6. Then, 7 liters of water is added to the mix. This increases the water amount by 7 liters and the total volume by 7 liters.  
7. The final mixture now has:
   - Total volume = 23 + 7 = 30 liters.
   - Total water = 8 + 7 = 15 liters.
8. Therefore, the percentage of water in the final mix is (15/30) × 100 = 50%.

If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 10 hours if she spends 2/5 of the time running, 1/2 of the time skipping, and the remaining of the time walking?",27.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

Mei's skipping speed is given as 2 miles per hour.
Since she skips at half the speed at which she runs, her running speed is 2 × 2 = 4 miles per hour.
Also, Mei runs four times faster than she walks, so her walking speed is 4 / 4 = 1 mile per hour.

Over a total of 10 hours:
• Running time = 2/5 of 10 hours = 4 hours.
• Skipping time = 1/2 of 10 hours = 5 hours.
• Walking time = Remaining time = 10 – (4 + 5) = 1 hour.

Now, let’s calculate the distance she travels during each activity:
• While running: 4 mph × 4 hours = 16 miles.
• While skipping: 2 mph × 5 hours = 10 miles.
• While walking: 1 mph × 1 hour = 1 mile.

Adding the distances together: 16 + 10 + 1 = 27 miles.

If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?",180.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, determine how many calories you have left.  
 • Your daily target is 2300 calories.  
 • You have already consumed 1200 calories.  
 • You exercised and burned 100 calories, which effectively gives you an extra 100 calories allowance.  
 • So, the remaining calories you can consume = 2300 – 1200 + 100 = 1200 calories.

2. Next, find out the number of calories per ounce of cookies.  
 • The bag of cookies contains 150 oz in total and is divided into 5 servings.  
 • Therefore, the weight of one serving = 150 oz / 5 = 30 oz.  
 • Each serving has 200 calories, so calories per ounce = 200 calories / 30 oz = 20/3 calories per oz (approximately 6.67 calories per oz).

3. Now, calculate how many ounces of cookies you can eat with your remaining 1200 calories.  
 • Let x be the number of ounces you can eat.  
 • Total calories from x oz = x * (20/3)  
 • Set up the equation: x * (20/3) = 1200  
 • To solve for x, multiply both sides by 3/20:

2. On Sunday, he also watched a 4-hour episode.
3. On Tuesday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show (which is 0.75 hours), so Tuesday's total is 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.
4. On Wednesday, he watched two 5-hour episodes, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

If she used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.",504.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The ratio for sugar to water is given as 63:14. This means if we let k be the multiplier, then:
   - Teaspoons of sugar = 63k
   - Cups of water = 14k

2. The recipe calls for 9 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water. Since there are 14k cups of water, we find the tablespoons of milk by setting up the proportion:
   - Milk = (9/7) × (14k) = 18k

3. Now, the total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk used is:
   63k + 14k + 18k = 95k

4. We are told that this total is 760, so we set up the equation:
   95k = 760

5. Solving for k:
   k = 760 / 95 = 8

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of notebooks.  
Arjun bought 12 notebooks, each costing ₣2.75.  
Cost of notebooks = 12 × 2.75 = ₣33.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of rulers.  
He bought 6 rulers, each costing ₣9.0.  
Cost of rulers = 6 × 9.0 = ₣54.

Step 3: Add the cost of the bond paper.  
The bond paper costs ₣10.

1. First, calculate the probability that Luis rolls a number greater than 10 on a 20-sided die.  
 • Numbers greater than 10 are 11, 12, …, 20, which makes 10 outcomes.  
 • So, the probability is 10/20 = 0.5 (or 50%).

2. Next, calculate the probability that he rolls four odd numbers in a row.  
 • For one roll, there are 10 odd numbers (since half of the numbers 1–20 are odd), so the probability is 10/20 = 0.5.  
 • Because the rolls are independent, the probability for four consecutive odd outcomes is (0.5)^4 = 0.0625 (or 6.25%).

3. Now, compare the two events.  
 • The probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is 0.5, and the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row is 0.0625.  
 • To see how much more likely the first event is, we divide: 0.5 / 0.0625 = 8.  
 • This means rolling a number greater than 10 is 8 times as likely as rolling four odd numbers in a row.

4. Expressing this as a percentage increase over the probability of rolling four odd numbers:  
 • Being 8 times as likely means it is 700% more likely (since a probability 7 times larger than 0.0625, when added to the original 0.0625, gives 0.5).

Liam found:
• 64 rabbits,

1. Yuki originally had 8 pen pals but stopped corresponding with 4 of them. This leaves him with 8 – 4 = 4 active pen pals.

2. Each active pen pal sends 3 letters a week, and each letter is 10 pages long. So, each friend sends 3 × 10 = 30 pages per week.

3. Since he has 4 active pen pals, the total pages he receives (and then responds to in kind) per week is 4 × 30 = 120 pages.

4. Yuki writes 1 page in 14 minutes. Therefore, to write 120 pages, he spends 120 × 14 = 1680 minutes per week.

Emma’s total budget is €180.

1. For each person (Emma and a friend), the costs are:  
 • Laser tag: €6  
 • Pinball tokens: €4  
 • Roller coaster rides (3 rides at €10 each): 3 × €10 = €30  
 So, the total cost per person is: €6 + €4 + €30 = €40.

2. In addition, there is a fixed cost for renting a bus, which is €60.

Diego drinks 3 bottles of soda, and each bottle has 7 mL of soda.  
• First, we calculate the total mL of soda: 3 bottles × 7 mL per bottle = 21 mL.

The soda has 6 calories per mL.  
• Therefore, the calories from the soda are: 21 mL × 6 calories per mL = 126 calories.

How many pineapples and kiwis does Theo have in the house combined?",349.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Initially, Theo has 25 kiwis. Since there are eight times as many pineapples as kiwis in his house, he starts with  
  pineapples = 8 × 25 = 200.

2. Then, Theo goes to the store and buys 63 more kiwis. This purchase adds 63 to his kiwis. In the same trip he also buys pineapples, and he buys “19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis” he bought. That means he buys  
  pineapples = 63 – 19 = 44.

How much money does Ananya have left?",361.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, calculate the cost for the saltwater taffy.
 • The sale is “Buy 16 kgs at $23 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/2 off.”
 • Ananya scooped up a total of 23 kgs.
 • For the first 16 kgs, the cost is 16 × $23 = $368.
 • Out of the remaining 7 kgs (23 - 16 = 7), the sale applies to 4 kgs at half price. At half off, the price per kg becomes $23/2 = $11.50, so the cost for these 4 kgs is 4 × $11.50 = $46.
 • The remaining 3 kgs (7 - 4 = 3) are charged at the full price of $23 per kg, costing 3 × $23 = $69.
 • Therefore, the total cost for the taffy is $368 + $46 + $69 = $483.

2. Next, calculate the cost for the mixed bag of starfish.
 • It costs $11.0.

3. Now, calculate the cost for the keychains.
 • There are 17 keychains at $20.0 each, so the cost is 17 × $20 = $340.

Andre's purchases were:
1. 4 bags of crackers at 75 cents each.
2. 7 packs of pretzels at $7 each.
3. Some gum at 100 cents (or $1) each.

First, calculate the cost of the crackers:
4 bags × $0.75 = $3.00

Next, calculate the cost of the pretzels:
7 packs × $7 = $49.00

Let the number of packs of gum be x. Since each costs $1, the cost for the gum is:

1. Let the width of the office be w feet. Then, the length is w + 16 feet (since it is 16 feet longer than the width).
2. The area of the rectangle is given by the product of its width and length. So, we have:
  w × (w + 16) = 225.
3. This simplifies to the quadratic equation:
  w² + 16w - 225 = 0.
4. To solve for w, we can use the quadratic formula: 
  w = ( -b ± √(b² - 4ac) ) / (2a), where a = 1, b = 16, and c = -225.

Adding these up, the bowls and plates together can hold 231 + 168 = 399 crackers.

Step 3: Determine how many crackers won't be able to be placed.
Deshawn has 410 crackers available, but the bowls and plates together can hold only 399 crackers.
Thus, the crackers that won't be placed are 410 - 399 = 11 crackers.

1. Each goat consumes 9 kilograms of grain.
2. Each alpaca needs 3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs. So first, calculate twice the amount for a goat: 2 × 9 = 18 kilograms. Then, subtract 3 kilograms: 18 - 3 = 15 kilograms for each alpaca.
3. Each cow eats as much as a goat and an alpaca together. So, a cow's consumption is 9 + 15 = 24 kilograms.

1. The hospital has a capacity of 800 beds.
2. One-fifth of all the beds are out of service. So, the number of out-of-service beds is 800 * (1/5) = 160 beds.
3. The remaining working beds are 800 - 160 = 640 beds.
4. Initially, 1/8 of the total beds are occupied. That is 800 * (1/8) = 100 occupied beds.
5. This means the unoccupied working beds at the start are 640 - 100 = 540 beds.
6. Due to the flu season, 35 patients are admitted each day. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions is 35 * 14 = 490 patients.

On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday and 28 boxes of orange pie. On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the cupcake cost ₺10 and the orange pie cost ₺22, how much was Andre's average daily earning?",980.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Monday's Sales:
 • Cupcakes: 24 boxes.
 • Orange pies: We are told that on Monday he sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pie than he did on Tuesday. We'll find Tuesday’s orange pie sales next.

2. Tuesday's Sales:
 • Cupcakes: He sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday. So, Tuesday’s cupcakes = 24 + 11 = 35 boxes.
 • Orange pies: He sold 28 boxes.

3. Now, we can determine Monday’s orange pies:
 • Monday’s orange pies = Tuesday’s orange pies – 16 = 28 – 16 = 12 boxes.

4. Wednesday's Sales:
 • The problem states that on Wednesday he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. We assume that for each product he sold on Wednesday he sold the sum of the boxes from Monday and Tuesday.
  – Wednesday’s cupcakes = Monday’s cupcakes + Tuesday’s cupcakes = 24 + 35 = 59 boxes.
  – Wednesday’s orange pies = Monday’s orange pies + Tuesday’s orange pies = 12 + 28 = 40 boxes.

5. Calculating Daily Earnings:
 • The price per cupcake box is ₺10 and per orange pie box is ₺22.
  – Monday:
   ○ Cupcakes: 24 × ₺10 = ₺240.
   ○ Orange pies: 12 × ₺22 = ₺264.
   ○ Total Monday = ₺240 + ₺264 = ₺504.
  – Tuesday:
   ○ Cupcakes: 35 × ₺10 = ₺350.

1. Dr. Lee’s class has 125 students.

2. First, 24% of the class are volleyball players.  
  24% of 125 = 0.24 × 125 = 30 volleyball players.

3. Next, the remaining students number 125 – 30 = 95. Out of these, 40% are robotics club members or part of the choir.  
  40% of 95 = 0.40 × 95 = 38 students.

4. These form two groups so far:

  • Robotics/choir members

5. However, half of the volleyball players are absent due to sickness. So, only half of 30 are available:  
  30 / 2 = 15 volleyball players leaving early.

6. Now, the problem tells us that along with these groups, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each group. Since there are 3 groups of students leaving early (volleyball players, robotics/choir, and the cheerleaders themselves as the third group), we add additional cheerleaders for each:
  3 cheerleaders per group × 3 groups = 9 cheerleaders.

1. The comet appears every 53 years.
2. Liam’s uncle saw the comet when he was 31 years old.
3. Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times that age, i.e. 2 × 31 = 62 years old.
4. Since the comet’s appearances are 53 years apart, the two sightings by any person (or seen by different people at different times) must be 53 years apart. That means that Liam’s two sightings occurred 53 years apart.
5. If Liam’s second sighting was at age 62, then his first sighting was at 62 − 53 = 9 years old.
6. Now, note that the comet sightings are global events. This means that the comet appearance when Liam was 62 is the same event the world observed.
7. We can line up the events by letting:
  • Uncle’s comet sighting occurred when he was 31, at time (Uncle’s birth year + 31).
  • Liam’s second sighting occurred at time (Liam’s birth year + 62).
8. Since they both saw the comet during that same appearance, the difference between these two times is 0. (That is, the global appearance happened only once.)

p1,gsm-symbolic,o3-mini-2025-01-31,"Olivia walks 20 kilometers every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 kilometers of walking on the beach and 10 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?",75.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Let v be Olivia’s original speed on the beach.
2. Originally, on the sidewalk she walks at 4 times the beach speed, so her sidewalk speed is 4v.
3. Due to her injury, both speeds are reduced by half. This makes her effective beach speed v/2 and her effective sidewalk speed (4v)/2 = 2v.
4. The beach section is 10 km. The time spent on the beach is given to be 60 minutes. Using the formula time = distance/speed:
  Time on beach = 10 / (v/2) = 20/v.
  Since 20/v = 60, we can solve for v:
    20/v = 60 ⟹ v = 20/60 = 1/3 km per minute.
5. Now, for the sidewalk section:
  Distance = 10 km.
  Effective sidewalk speed = 2v = 2 × (1/3) = 2/3 km per minute.
  Time on sidewalk = 10 / (2/3) = 10 × (3/2) = 15 minutes.
6. The total time for the 20 km walk is the sum of the beach time and the sidewalk time:
  Total time = 60 minutes + 15 minutes = 75 minutes.

1. First, determine the total number of days: 10 weeks × 7 days per week = 70 days.
2. For the first 57 days, Arjun eats 3 pancakes a day. So, he eats 57 × 3 = 171 pancakes.
3. For the remaining days, calculate how many days are left: 70 - 57 = 13 days.
4. For these 13 days, he eats 9 pancakes a day. So, he eats 13 × 9 = 117 pancakes.
5. Now, find the total number of pancakes: 171 + 117 = 288.
6. Finally, since one dozen equals 12 pancakes, determine the number of dozens: 288 ÷ 12 = 24.

Noah finds half as many as Winnie, and Oscar finds four dozen eggs more than Tara and James combined. How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?",12.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, Esteban hid 11 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the total number of eggs is 11 × 12 = 132.

2. James finds 4 eggs.

3. Tara finds five times as many as James, so she finds 5 × 4 = 20 eggs.

4. Winnie finds 4 less than Tara, so she finds 20 - 4 = 16 eggs.

5. Noah finds half as many as Winnie, so he finds 16 ÷ 2 = 8 eggs.

6. Oscar finds four dozen eggs more than Tara and James combined. First, Tara and James together have 20 + 4 = 24 eggs. Four dozen eggs is 4 × 12 = 48 eggs. Thus, Oscar finds 24 + 48 = 72 eggs.

7. Next, we add up the eggs found by all:
   • James: 4 eggs  
   • Tara: 20 eggs  
   • Winnie: 16 eggs  
   • Noah: 8 eggs  
   • Oscar: 72 eggs  

   Total found = 4 + 20 + 16 + 8 + 72 = 120 eggs.

How much money does he make in a week?,1539.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The first 2 apartment complexes have 300 apartments each. Together, they have 300 + 300 = 600 apartments.

2. The third complex is 50% bigger than the other two combined. That means it has 600 + (50% of 600) = 600 + 300 = 900 apartments.

3. In total, Oliver covers 600 + 900 = 1500 apartments.

4. He collects garbage 2 times a week from each apartment. So, the total number of collections in a week is 1500 × 2 = 3000 collections.

5. For each collection, he gets paid ¥0.45. The base weekly pay is 3000 × ¥0.45 = ¥1350.

6. Additionally, he earns 14% on tips. This means he gets an extra 0.14 × ¥1350 = ¥189 from tips.

If they work for 6 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?",60.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The maintenance worker needs to clean 180 floors in 10 days. This means they clean 180 / 10 = 18 floors per day.

2. Normally, it takes 6 minutes to clean a floor, but due to the injury it now takes twice as long. So, the new time per floor is 6 * 2 = 12 minutes.

3. The total cleaning time per day is 18 floors * 12 minutes per floor = 216 minutes.

1. In the first 22 seconds, 90 kernels pop.
2. In the next 22 seconds, the number of popped kernels is 3 times the initial amount. That is 90 × 3 = 270.
3. In the following 22 seconds, the rate increases to 4 times the initial rate. So, 90 × 4 = 360 kernels pop.
