Sofia bought 6 dozen eclairs at $18 per dozen, so the cost of the eclairs is 6 * 18 = 108 dollars.
She bought 7 dozen cookies at $74 per dozen, so the cost of the cookies is 7 * 74 = 518 dollars.
She bought 8 dozen muffins at $116 per dozen, so the cost of the muffins is 8 * 116 = 928 dollars.

1. You start with 20 liters of peach drink that is 1/5 water. So initially, the peach drink contains 20 × (1/5) = 4 liters of water.

2. However, you spill 5 liters of the peach drink. Since the drink is uniformly 1/5 water, the spilled portion contains 5 × (1/5) = 1 liter of water.

3. This means the remaining peach drink (20 - 5 = 15 liters) now has 4 - 1 = 3 liters of water.

4. Next, you have 16 liters of lemon drink that is 1/4 water. So, the lemon drink contains 16 × (1/4) = 4 liters of water.

5. When you mix the remaining peach drink (15 liters) with the lemon drink (16 liters), you end up with 15 + 16 = 31 liters of drink.

6. The total water in the mixture is the water from the remaining peach drink (3 liters) plus the water from the lemon drink (4 liters), which gives 3 + 4 = 7 liters of water.

If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 6 hours if she spends 2/4 of the time running and three-sixths of the time walking?",36.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Jasmine's skip speed is given as 6 miles per hour, and this speed is 3/5 of her running speed.  
  So, if her running speed is R, then (3/5) * R = 6 mph.  
  To find R, multiply both sides by 5/3: R = 6 * (5/3) = 10 mph.

2. It is given that she can run five times faster than she can walk.  
  Let her walking speed be W mph. Then, R = 5 * W.  
  Substituting R = 10 mph, we get 10 = 5 * W, so W = 10/5 = 2 mph.

3. Jasmine spends 2/4 (which is 1/2) of her time running and 3/6 (which is also 1/2) of her time walking.  
  Since the total time is 6 hours, she spends 3 hours running and 3 hours walking.

4. Calculate the distance traveled while running:  
  Distance = speed * time = 10 mph * 3 hours = 30 miles.

5. Calculate the distance traveled while walking:  
  Distance = 2 mph * 3 hours = 6 miles.

If a 300 ounces bag has 5 servings, how many ounces can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2360 and you have already consumed 1700 calories?",144.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, determine the calories you can still consume. Your daily calorie target is 2360 calories, and you have already consumed 1700 calories. Thus, the remaining calories are:
  2360 - 1700 = 660 calories.

2. Next, find out how many calories are in each ounce of bread. The bag contains 300 ounces and is split into 5 servings, so each serving is:
  300 ounces / 5 servings = 60 ounces per serving.

3. According to the nutritional info, each serving has 275 calories. Therefore, the calories per ounce are:
  275 calories / 60 ounces ≈ 4.5833 calories per ounce.

4. Now, to find out how many ounces you can eat with the remaining 660 calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per ounce:
  660 calories / (275/60 calories per ounce) = 660 × (60/275) ounces.

1. First, we find the probability that Umar rolls a number greater than 3. On a six-sided die, the numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Since there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6, the probability is 3/6 = 0.5 (or 50%).

2. Next, we find the probability that Umar rolls two even numbers in a row. On a six-sided die, the even numbers are 2, 4, and 6. For one roll, the probability of getting an even number is 3/6 = 0.5. Since the rolls are independent, the probability for two consecutive even numbers is 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.25 (or 25%).

3. Now, to determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers, we compare the two probabilities.  
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50%, and that for rolling two even numbers is 25%.
   - To find how much more likely this is, we calculate the percentage increase relative to the 25% chance. The increase is 50% - 25% = 25%.

main,gsm-symbolic,o3-mini-2025-01-31,"Sofia went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her ¥1200 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, fudge was on sale for ""Buy 16 kgs at ¥21 per kg, get 5 kgs 2/3 off."" She scooped up 23 kgs. She also bought a mixed bag of sand dollars for ¥11.5 and 17 postcards that were ¥20.5 each. How much money does Sofia have left?",427.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, let’s calculate the cost of the fudge.
   • The sale offer is: “Buy 16 kgs at ¥21 per kg, get 5 kgs 2/3 off.”
   • This means if Sofia buys 16 kgs at full price, she may add 5 kgs at a discount. A “2/3 off” discount means the price is reduced by 2/3 of ¥21, so the discounted price per kg is:
     
     (1 - 2/3) × ¥21 = 1/3 × ¥21 = ¥7 per kg.

2. Sofia scoops up a total of 23 kgs of fudge.
   • Under the deal, the first 16 kgs are at full price, and the next 5 kgs are at the discounted price.
   • However, 16 + 5 = 21 kgs are covered by the offer. The remaining 23 - 21 = 2 kgs are not part of the discount deal and must be purchased at the full price of ¥21 per kg.
     
   Now, compute the cost:
   • Full-price cost for 16 kgs = 16 × ¥21 = ¥336.
   • Discounted cost for 5 kgs = 5 × ¥7 = ¥35.
   • Full-price cost for additional 2 kgs = 2 × ¥21 = ¥42.
     
   • Total cost for the fudge = ¥336 + ¥35 + ¥42 = ¥413.

3. Next, she buys a mixed bag of sand dollars for ¥11.5.

4. Then, she buys 17 postcards at ¥20.5 each.
   • Total cost for postcards = 17 × ¥20.5.
   • Calculating: 17 × 20.5 = (10 × 20.5) + (7 × 20.5) = ¥205 + ¥143.5 = ¥348.5.

5. Now, add up all the expenses:
   • Fudge = ¥413
   • Sand dollars = ¥11.5
   • Postcards = ¥348.5
     
   • Total spent = ¥413 + ¥11.5 + ¥348.5 = ¥773.

6. Sofia originally had ¥1200.
   • The amount of money she has left = ¥1200 - ¥773 = ¥427.

1. Let the number of pretzels Liam bought be x.
2. The cost of each bag of popcorn is 25 cents, so 4 bags cost 4 × 25 = 100 cents.
3. The cost of each pretzel is 100 cents, so x pretzels cost 100 × x cents.
4. According to the problem, Liam’s total purchase cost (the amount he spent) is ₣1000. This means the combined cost of the 4 popcorn bags and the pretzels is 1000 cents. (In this context, ₣1000 represents 1000 cents.)
5. Set up the equation for the total cost:
  100 (cost for popcorn) + 100x (cost for pretzels) = 1000.

The problem tells us that:

First, we find the number of blue cards:
Blue cards = 80 + 55% of 80  
55% of 80 = 0.55 × 80 = 44  
So, blue cards = 80 + 44 = 124

Next, we determine the number of green cards:
Green cards = orange cards + blue cards = 80 + 124 = 204

1. The care facility has a total capacity of 1900 rooms.
2. Initially, 2/5 of these rooms are occupied. To find the number of occupied rooms initially, multiply 1900 by 2/5:
  Occupied initially = 1900 * (2/5) = 760.
3. This means the number of unoccupied rooms initially is:
  Unoccupied initially = Total rooms - Occupied initially = 1900 - 760 = 1140.
4. Due to the pandemic, 80 patients are admitted each day. In 2 weeks (which is 14 days), the total number of patients admitted is:
  Total new patients = 80 * 14 = 1120.
5. With each new patient, one room becomes occupied. So the total occupied rooms after 2 weeks is:
  Total occupied = Initial occupied rooms + New patients = 760 + 1120 = 1880.

1. On Friday:
   - Brownies sold = 29 boxes.

So, the time to ride the biggest slide is 400 / 80 = 5 minutes.
The second biggest waterslide is 200 meters long and the slide speed is 100 meters/minute.
So, the time to ride the second biggest slide is 200 / 100 = 2 minutes.
The difference in time is 5 minutes - 2 minutes = 3 minutes.

If 66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 27-mile walk, in minutes?",90.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Emma walks 11 miles on the beach and spends 66 minutes doing so. This means her walking speed on the beach is 11 miles ÷ 66 minutes = 1/6 mile per minute.

2. On the sidewalk, she walks at four times her beach speed. So, her sidewalk speed is 4 × (1/6 mile per minute) = 2/3 mile per minute.

3. Since the sidewalk portion is 16 miles, the time taken on the sidewalk is 16 miles ÷ (2/3 mile per minute) = 16 × (3/2) = 24 minutes.

Winnie eats 4 eggs a day for the first 60 days, so during that period she eats 4 × 60 = 240 eggs.

Then, Winnie increases her consumption to 5 eggs a day for the next 96 days, so during that period she eats 5 × 96 = 480 eggs.

The total number of eggs eaten over 156 days is 240 + 480 = 720 eggs.

3. The cleaner works 11 hours each day. Converting hours to minutes:
   11 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 660 minutes per day.

4. Now, we find what percentage of the day is spent cleaning by dividing the daily cleaning time by the total work time and then multiplying by 100:

1. In the first 22 seconds, 30 kernels pop.
2. In the next 22 seconds, twice that amount pop. That is 2 × 30 = 60 kernels.
