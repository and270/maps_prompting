main,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Jasmine can run five times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is 3/5 as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 6 hours if she spends 2/4 of the time running and three-sixths of the time walking?",36.0,"To solve the problem, we need to determine Jasmine's walking speed, running speed, and then calculate the distance she can travel in 6 hours based on the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Jasmine's running speed:**
   - We know that Jasmine can skip at a speed of 6 miles per hour.
   - The problem states that she can skip at a rate that is \( \frac{3}{5} \) as fast as she can run. Let \( r \) be her running speed.
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[
     \frac{3}{5} r = 6
     \]
   - To find \( r \), we can multiply both sides by \( \frac{5}{3} \):
     \[
     r = 6 \times \frac{5}{3} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

2. **Determine Jasmine's walking speed:**
   - The problem states that Jasmine can run five times faster than she can walk. Let \( w \) be her walking speed.
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[
     r = 5w
     \]
   - We already found \( r = 10 \) miles per hour, so:
     \[
     10 = 5w
     \]
   - To find \( w \), we divide both sides by 5:
     \[
     w = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Jasmine spends \( \frac{2}{4} \) of the time running and \( \frac{3}{6} \) of the time walking. 
   - First, simplify these fractions:
     - \( \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \)
     - \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \)
   - This means she spends half of the time running and half of the time walking.

4. **Calculate the time spent on each activity in 6 hours:**
   - Total time = 6 hours
   - Time spent running = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \) hours
   - Time spent walking = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \) hours

5. **Calculate the distances traveled while running and walking:**
   - Distance while running:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Distance while walking:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 2 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 30 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 36 \text{ miles}
   \]

Thus, the total distance Jasmine can travel in 6 hours is \( \boxed{36} \) miles.",36.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine Jasmine's running speed**: 
   - We know that Jasmine can skip at 6 miles per hour.
   - She skips at a rate that is 3/5 as fast as she can run. 
   - Let \( R \) be her running speed. Then, we have:
     \[
     \frac{3}{5}R = 6
     \]
   - To find \( R \), we can multiply both sides by \( \frac{5}{3} \):
     \[
     R = 6 \times \frac{5}{3} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

2. **Determine Jasmine's walking speed**:
   - We know that Jasmine can run five times faster than she can walk. 
   - Let \( W \) be her walking speed. Then, we have:
     \[
     R = 5W
     \]
   - Substituting \( R = 10 \):
     \[
     10 = 5W
     \]
   - To find \( W \), we divide both sides by 5:
     \[
     W = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time Jasmine runs and walks**:
   - She spends \( \frac{2}{4} \) of the time running and \( \frac{3}{6} \) of the time walking.
   - Since \( \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \), this means she spends half of the time running and half of the time walking.

4. **Determine the total time spent**:
   - The total time is 6 hours.
   - Time spent running:
     \[
     \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time spent walking:
     \[
     \text{Time walking} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while running**:
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance running:
     \[
     \text{Distance running} = R \times \text{Time running} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
     \]

6. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking**:
   - Distance walking:
     \[
     \text{Distance walking} = W \times \text{Time walking} = 2 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}
     \]

7. **Calculate the total distance traveled**:
   - Total distance:

   \]

Therefore, you can eat approximately **144 ounces** of bread.",144.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many calories are left in the daily calorie target after consuming 1700 calories.
   - Daily calorie target = 2360 calories
   - Calories already consumed = 1700 calories
   - Remaining calories = 2360 - 1700 = 660 calories

2. Next, we need to find out how many calories are in one serving of the bag of breads.
   - Each serving has 275 calories.

3. Now, we can calculate how many servings can be consumed with the remaining 660 calories.
   - Number of servings = Remaining calories / Calories per serving
   - Number of servings = 660 / 275 ≈ 2.4 servings

4. Since we cannot consume a fraction of a serving in this context, we will consider only whole servings. Therefore, you can consume 2 servings.

5. Now, we need to find out how many ounces correspond to 2 servings. Since the bag has 5 servings and weighs 300 ounces, we can calculate the weight per serving.
   - Weight per serving = Total weight / Number of servings
   - Weight per serving = 300 ounces / 5 servings = 60 ounces per serving

6. Finally, we can calculate the total ounces for 2 servings.
   - Total ounces for 2 servings = 2 servings * 60 ounces per serving = 120 ounces

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. 

   - There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6).
   - The total number of outcomes is 6.

   Therefore, the probability \( P(\text{greater than 3}) \) is:
   \[
   P(\text{greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. 

   - There are 3 even numbers.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \).
   - The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \).

   Since the rolls are independent, the probability \( P(\text{two even numbers}) \) is:
   \[
   P(\text{two even numbers}) = P(\text{even on first roll}) \times P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   Now we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. We can calculate the difference in probabilities:

     P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]
   - The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
     \[
     P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
     \[
     P(\text{two evens}) = P(\text{even on first roll}) \times P(\text{even on second roll}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
     \]

3. **Calculate how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.**
   - We need to find the difference in probabilities:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = P(\text{greater than 3}) - P(\text{two evens}) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25
     \]

4. **Express this difference as a percentage.**
   - To convert the difference to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = 0.25 \times 100 = 25\%

Over the holiday she solved 4 word puzzles and 14 jigsaw puzzles. How much time did she spend playing these games?,242.0,"To find out how much time Leilani spent playing the puzzles, we need to calculate the total time spent on both the word puzzles and the jigsaw puzzles.

1. **Calculate the time spent on word puzzles:**
   - Time for one word puzzle = 29 minutes
   - Number of word puzzles solved = 4
   - Total time for word puzzles = 29 minutes/puzzle × 4 puzzles = 116 minutes

2. **Calculate the time spent on jigsaw puzzles:**
   - Time for one jigsaw puzzle = 9 minutes
   - Number of jigsaw puzzles solved = 14
   - Total time for jigsaw puzzles = 9 minutes/puzzle × 14 puzzles = 126 minutes

If there were 69 ladybugs, calculate the total number of insects in the plot.",115.0,"To find the total number of insects in the plot, we need to determine the number of caterpillars based on the number of ladybugs.

1. **Identify the number of ladybugs**: 
   \[
   \text{Number of ladybugs} = 69
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of caterpillars**: 
   According to the problem, there are four-sixths as many caterpillars as ladybugs. We can express this mathematically as:
   \[
   \text{Number of caterpillars} = \frac{4}{6} \times \text{Number of ladybugs}
   \]
   Substituting the number of ladybugs:
   \[
   \text{Number of caterpillars} = \frac{4}{6} \times 69
   \]

3. **Simplify \(\frac{4}{6}\)**:
   \[
   \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of caterpillars**:
   \[
   \text{Number of caterpillars} = \frac{2}{3} \times 69
   \]
   To perform the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{2 \times 69}{3} = \frac{138}{3} = 46
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of insects**:
   The total number of insects is the sum of the number of ladybugs and the number of caterpillars:
   \[
   \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ladybugs} + \text{Number of caterpillars}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total number of insects} = 69 + 46 = 115

Thus, the total number of insects in the plot is \(\boxed{115}\).",115.0,1,"Let's think step by step.  
Haruka found 69 ladybugs in the plot.  
The number of caterpillars is four-sixths of the number of ladybugs.  
To find the number of caterpillars, we calculate:  
\( \text{Caterpillars} = \frac{4}{6} \times 69 \).  

First, simplify \( \frac{4}{6} \) to \( \frac{2}{3} \):  
\( \text{Caterpillars} = \frac{2}{3} \times 69 \).  

Now, calculate \( \frac{2}{3} \times 69 \):  
\( 69 \div 3 = 23 \).  
Then, \( 23 \times 2 = 46 \).  
So, there are 46 caterpillars.  

Now, to find the total number of insects in the plot, we add the number of ladybugs and caterpillars:

He can write a page every 6 minutes. How many hours does he spend writing a week?,24.0,"To find out how many hours Umar spends writing each week, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pen pals he is currently corresponding with:**
   - Initially, Umar had 9 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 3 of them.
   - Therefore, the number of pen pals he currently has is:
     \[
     9 - 3 = 6
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of letters he receives each week:**
   - Each pen pal sends 4 letters a week.
   - With 6 pen pals, the total number of letters he receives is:
     \[
     6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ letters}
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of pages he receives each week:**
   - Each letter is 10 pages long.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages he receives is:
     \[
     24 \times 10 = 240 \text{ pages}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pages he writes in response:**
   - Umar responds in kind, meaning he writes the same number of pages as he receives.
   - Thus, he writes 240 pages in response.

5. **Determine how long it takes him to write one page:**
   - Umar can write a page in 6 minutes.

6. **Calculate the total time he spends writing in minutes:**
   - The total time in minutes to write 240 pages is:
     \[
     240 \times 6 = 1440 \text{ minutes}
     \]

7. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we convert minutes to hours:

3. **Calculate the number of weeks in July:**
   - July has 31 days.
   - There are 4 full weeks in July (28 days) and 3 extra days.
   - Since Yusuf works 4 days a week, he will work 4 days in the first 4 weeks and then 3 more days in the remaining days of July.

[Example Input]
Question: Maria works a 6-hour shift each day, 5 days a week. She earns $20 per hour and receives a $150 bonus each week if her team meets their goals. How much money did Maria make in March if her team met their goals every week?

Wrong answer: Maria earned $600 in total for the month. I calculated her weekly earnings as $20 * 6 hours * 5 days = $600, but I forgot to account for the bonus.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total earnings by not including the weekly bonus in my calculations. I only considered the hourly wage without adding the bonus amount.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Omission
- Bonus

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total hours worked in a week (hours per day * days per week).
2. Multiply the total hours by the hourly wage to find the weekly earnings.
3. Add the weekly bonus to the weekly earnings.
4. Multiply the total weekly earnings by the number of weeks in the month to find the total earnings for the month.

Advice:
- Always check if there are additional earnings such as bonuses or commissions.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to ensure all components are accounted for.
- Double-check calculations to avoid simple arithmetic errors.

Solution:
Maria worked 6 hours/day * 5 days/week = 30 hours/week. Her weekly earnings are $20/hour * 30 hours = $600. Adding the bonus, her total weekly earnings are $600 + $150 = $750. In March, there are 4 weeks, so her total earnings for the month are $750 * 4 = $3000.

[Example Input]
Question: Maria works a 6-hour shift each day, 5 days a week. She earns $20 per hour and receives a $150 bonus each week if her team meets their goals. How much money did Maria make in March if her team met their goals every week?

Wrong answer: Maria earned $600 in total for the month. I calculated her weekly earnings as $20 * 6 hours * 5 days = $600, but I forgot to account for the bonus.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total earnings by not including the weekly bonus in my calculations. I only considered the hourly wage without adding the bonus amount.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Omission
- Bonus

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total hours worked in a week (hours per day * days per week).
2. Multiply the total hours by the hourly wage to find the weekly earnings.
3. Add the weekly bonus to the weekly earnings.
4. Multiply the total weekly earnings by the number of weeks in the month to find the total earnings for the month.

Advice:
- Always check if there are additional earnings such as bonuses or commissions.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to ensure all components are accounted for.
- Double-check calculations to avoid simple arithmetic errors.

Solution:
Maria worked 6 hours/day * 5 days/week = 30 hours/week. Her weekly earnings are $20/hour * 30 hours = $600. Adding the bonus, her total weekly earnings are $600 + $150 = $750. In March, there are 4 weeks, so her total earnings for the month are $750 * 4 = $3000.

How many engineers are left if 26 artists stayed at the conference?",66.0,"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the total number of people at the conference initially.

1. **Calculate the initial total number of people:**
   - Number of artists = 64
   - Number of engineers = 51
   - Total number of people = Number of artists + Number of engineers
   \[
   \text{Total} = 64 + 51 = 115

2. **Determine how many people left the conference:**
   - One-fifth of the total number of people left.
   \[
   \text{People who left} = \frac{1}{5} \times 115 = 23

3. **Calculate the number of people remaining:**
   - Total remaining = Total initial - People who left
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 115 - 23 = 92

4. **Determine how many engineers are left:**
   - We know that 26 artists stayed at the conference.
   - Therefore, the number of people who stayed is:
   \[
   \text{People who stayed} = 92

   - Since 26 of those are artists, we can find the number of engineers who stayed:
   \[
   \text{Engineers who stayed} = \text{Total remaining} - \text{Artists who stayed}

   \[
   \text{Engineers who stayed} = 92 - 26 = 66

Thus, the number of engineers left at the conference is \( \boxed{66} \).",66.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, we need to find the total number of people at the beginning of the conference. There are 64 artists and 51 engineers.
   So, the total number of people is 64 + 51 = 115.

2. Next, we need to determine how many people left after half an hour. One-fifth of the total number of people left.
   To find one-fifth of 115, we calculate:
   115 / 5 = 23.

3. Now, we subtract the number of people who left from the total number of people:
   115 - 23 = 92.

4. We know that 26 artists stayed at the conference. To find out how many artists left, we subtract the number of artists who stayed from the original number of artists:
   64 - 26 = 38 artists left.

5. Since 23 people left in total and 38 artists left, we can find the number of engineers who left:
   Let the number of engineers who left be \( x \).
   So, we have:
   38 (artists left) + \( x \) (engineers left) = 23 (total left).
   This gives us:
   \( x = 23 - 38 = -15 \).

   Since this result doesn't make sense, it indicates that all engineers stayed, and the number of engineers who left is 0.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of people who left and did not properly account for the remaining teachers after determining how many left.
Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect subtraction
- Failure to account for all groups
Instructions:
1. Determine the total number of people at the beginning (students + teachers).
2. Calculate the number of people who left by finding one-fourth of the total.
3. Subtract the number of students who stayed from the initial number of students to find out how many left.
4. Subtract the number of students who left from the total number of people who left to find out how many teachers left.

I answered the question incorrectly because I did not properly calculate how many people left the conference and failed to account for the number of engineers who left. I mistakenly assumed that all engineers remained without considering the total number of people who left.

**Error Keywords:**
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect assumption
- Failure to account for all groups

**Instructions:**
1. Determine the total number of people at the beginning (artists + engineers).
2. Calculate the total number of people who left by finding one-fifth of the total.
3. Subtract the number of artists who stayed from the initial number of artists to find out how many artists left.
4. Subtract the number of artists who left from the total number of people who left to find out how many engineers left.
5. Subtract the number of engineers who left from the initial number of engineers to find out how many are left.

**Solution:**
1. Calculate the total number of people at the beginning:
   - Artists: 64
   - Engineers: 51
   - Total = 64 + 51 = 115

2. Calculate how many people left:
   - One-fifth of 115 = 115 / 5 = 23 people left.

3. Determine how many artists left:
   - If 26 artists stayed, then the number of artists who left = 64 - 26 = 38 artists left.

4. Calculate how many engineers left:
   - Total people who left = 23
   - Artists who left = 38
   - Therefore, engineers who left = Total left - Artists left = 23 - 38 = -15 (which indicates that all engineers left and more artists left than the total number of people who left, meaning all engineers are gone).

5. Since all engineers left, the number of engineers left = 51 - 23 = 0 engineers left.

**Final Answer:**
0 engineers are left at the conference.

I answered the question incorrectly because I did not properly calculate the total number of people at the conference and the number of people who left. I mistakenly assumed that all engineers remained without considering the total number of people who left and how that affected the number of engineers.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect total
- Failure to account for proportions

### Solution:
1. **Identify the total number of people at the beginning:**
   - Number of artists = 64
   - Number of engineers = 51
   - Total = 64 + 51 = 115

2. **Calculate the fraction of people who left:**
   - One-fifth of the total number of people left: 
   - People who left = (1/5) * 115 = 23

3. **Determine how many of each group (artists and engineers) left:**
   - Total people who left = 23
   - Artists who stayed = 26
   - Therefore, artists who left = 64 - 26 = 38
   - Since 38 artists left, the remaining people who left must be engineers:
   - Engineers who left = Total who left - Artists who left = 23 - 38 = -15 (This indicates an error in the assumption since the number of artists who left cannot exceed the total who left.)

4. **Reassess the number of engineers left:**
   - Since 38 artists left, it is impossible for 23 people to have left in total. This means I need to recalculate based on the correct understanding of the problem.
   - If 26 artists stayed, then 64 - 26 = 38 artists left.
   - Therefore, the total number of people who left must be 23, which means I need to adjust my understanding of how many engineers left.

5. **Calculate the number of engineers left:**
   - If 23 people left in total and 38 artists left, this is not possible. I need to recalculate based on the correct understanding of the problem.
   - If 23 people left and 26 artists stayed, then the number of engineers who left must be calculated based on the total number of engineers.
   - Since 38 artists left, this means that the total number of engineers must be adjusted.

### Final Calculation:
- Total people = 115
- People left = 23
- Artists left = 38
- Engineers left = 23 - 38 = -15 (This indicates an error in the assumption since the number of artists who left cannot exceed the total who left.)

### Correct Calculation:
1. Total people = 115
2. One-fifth of 115 = 23 people left.
3. If 26 artists stayed, then 64 - 26 = 38 artists left.
4. Therefore, the number of engineers who left = 23 - 38 = -15 (This indicates an error in the assumption since the number of artists who left cannot exceed the total who left.)

[Example Input]
Question: At a school, there are 80 students and 20 teachers. After a fire drill, one-fourth of the total number of people left the premises. How many teachers are left if 15 students stayed behind?
Wrong answer: I calculated that 20 people left (one-fourth of 100), and since 15 students stayed, I assumed all teachers left, so I said there were 0 teachers left.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of people who left and did not account for the number of students who stayed correctly. I also failed to consider how many teachers were present initially.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect assumption
- Failure to account for remaining individuals

Instructions:
1. Determine the total number of people initially present (students + teachers).
2. Calculate the number of people who left (one-fourth of the total).
3. Subtract the number of people who left from the total to find how many are remaining.
4. Identify how many students stayed and subtract that from the total number of students to find how many left.
5. Use the remaining number of people to determine how many teachers are left.

Advice:
- Always double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with fractions of totals.
- Clearly separate the groups (students and teachers) and track how many are in each group throughout the problem.
- When given information about remaining individuals, ensure you apply it correctly to the respective groups.

Solution:
Initially, there are 100 people (80 students + 20 teachers). One-fourth of 100 is 25, so 25 people left. If 15 students stayed, then 65 students left (80 - 15). Therefore, 25 - 65 = -40, which indicates that all teachers must have stayed. Thus, there are still 20 teachers left.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not properly calculate the total number of people initially present and failed to accurately determine how many people left. I also neglected to account for the number of engineers remaining after considering the artists who stayed.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect assumption
- Failure to account for remaining individuals

### Solution:
1. **Determine the total number of people initially present:**
   - Artists: 64
   - Engineers: 51
   - Total = 64 + 51 = 115

2. **Calculate the number of people who left:**
   - One-fifth of the total number of people left: 
   - Number of people who left = 1/5 of 115 = 115 / 5 = 23

3. **Calculate how many people are remaining:**
   - Remaining people = Total - People who left = 115 - 23 = 92

4. **Identify how many artists stayed:**
   - Artists who stayed = 26
   - Therefore, artists who left = 64 - 26 = 38

5. **Determine how many engineers are left:**
   - Total people who left = 23
   - Since 38 artists left, the number of engineers who left = 23 - 38 = -15, which indicates that all engineers must have stayed.
   - Therefore, the number of engineers remaining = 51 (initial engineers) - 0 (engineers who left) = 51.

### Final Answer:
There are **51 engineers left**.

### Instructions:
1. Calculate the total number of individuals present (sum of all groups).
2. Determine the fraction of the total that left.
3. Subtract the number of people who left from the total to find how many are remaining.
4. Identify how many individuals from each group stayed or left.
5. Use the remaining number of individuals to determine how many from each group are left.

### General Advice:
- Always start by calculating the total number of individuals involved in the problem.
- Carefully track how many individuals from each group are staying or leaving.
- When dealing with fractions, ensure you apply them correctly to the total number of individuals.
- Double-check your calculations to avoid miscounting or misinterpreting the numbers.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

What is the final value of all Keisha's shares?",1122.0,"To find the final value of all Keisha's shares, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the initial investment**: 
   Keisha buys 17 shares at ₣75 each.
   \[
   \text{Initial investment} = 17 \text{ shares} \times ₣75/\text{share} = ₣1275
   \]

2. **Calculate the stock price after the first year**:
   The stock price increases by 60% in the first year. 
   To find the new price after the increase:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 60\% \text{ of } ₣75 = 0.60 \times ₣75 = ₣45
   \]
   \[
   \text{New price after 1 year} = ₣75 + ₣45 = ₣120
   \]

3. **Calculate the stock price after the second year**:
   The stock price then decreases by 45% in the second year. 
   To find the decrease:
   \[
   \text{Decrease} = 45\% \text{ of } ₣120 = 0.45 \times ₣120 = ₣54
   \]
   \[
   \text{New price after 2 years} = ₣120 - ₣54 = ₣66
   \]

4. **Calculate the final value of all shares**:
   Now, we find the total value of all 17 shares at the new price of ₣66.
   \[
   \text{Final value} = 17 \text{ shares} \times ₣66/\text{share} = ₣1122

Thus, the final value of all Keisha's shares is **₣1122**.",1122.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Keisha buys 17 shares of a stock for ₣75 each.
   - The total cost of the shares is 17 * 75 = ₣1275.

2. The stock price increases by 60% in the first year.
   - To find the new price after the increase, we calculate 60% of ₣75:
     - 60% of ₣75 = 0.60 * 75 = ₣45.
   - Now, we add this increase to the original price:
     - New price after increase = ₣75 + ₣45 = ₣120.

3. In the second year, the stock price decreases by 45%.
   - To find the decrease, we calculate 45% of ₣120:
     - 45% of ₣120 = 0.45 * 120 = ₣54.
   - Now, we subtract this decrease from the new price:
     - New price after decrease = ₣120 - ₣54 = ₣66.

4. Finally, we calculate the total value of all Keisha's shares at the end of the second year.

She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of laser tag, have $6 in pinball tokens, and get to ride the roller coaster eight times. A round of laser tag is $6. The roller coaster cost $11 a ride. How many friends can she invite?",1.0,"To determine how many friends Sofia can invite to her birthday party, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities for Sofia and her friends and then see how many friends fit within the $200 budget.

1. **Cost of Laser Tag**:
   - Cost per person for laser tag: $6
   - Total cost for Sofia and her friends for laser tag: 
     \[
     \text{Total cost for laser tag} = 6 \times (n + 1)
     \]
     where \( n \) is the number of friends.

2. **Cost of Pinball Tokens**:
   - Each person gets $6 in pinball tokens.
   - Total cost for pinball tokens:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for pinball tokens} = 6 \times (n + 1)
     \]

3. **Cost of Roller Coaster Rides**:
   - Cost per ride: $11
   - Total rides for Sofia and her friends: 8 rides each.
   - Total cost for roller coaster rides:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for roller coaster rides} = 11 \times 8 \times (n + 1)
     \]

4. **Total Cost Calculation**:
   Now we can sum up all the costs:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of laser tag} + \text{Cost of pinball tokens} + \text{Cost of roller coaster rides}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 6(n + 1) + 6(n + 1) + 11 \times 8(n + 1)

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 6(n + 1) + 6(n + 1) + 88(n + 1)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = (6 + 6 + 88)(n + 1) = 100(n + 1)
   \]

5. **Setting Up the Budget Equation**:
   We know that the total cost must be less than or equal to the budget of $200:
   \[
   100(n + 1) \leq 200
   \]

6. **Solving for \( n \)**:
   Divide both sides by 100:
   \[
   n + 1 \leq 2
   \]
   Subtract 1 from both sides:
   \[
   n \leq 1

1. Sofia's mom has a budget of $200 for the birthday party.
2. The cost for one round of laser tag is $6.
3. Each friend will also need $6 in pinball tokens.
4. The cost for riding the roller coaster is $11 per ride, and Sofia wants to ride it 8 times.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Sofia:

- Cost for laser tag: $6
- Cost for pinball tokens: $6
- Total cost for roller coaster rides: 8 rides * $11 = $88

Now, let's add these costs together to find out how much Sofia will spend:

Total cost for Sofia = Cost for laser tag + Cost for pinball tokens + Total cost for roller coaster rides
Total cost for Sofia = $6 + $6 + $88 = $100

Now, we need to find out how much money is left in the budget for her friends:

Remaining budget = Total budget - Total cost for Sofia
Remaining budget = $200 - $100 = $100

Next, we need to determine how much it costs for each friend to join in on the activities:

- Each friend will also need to pay for laser tag ($6) and pinball tokens ($6), and they will also ride the roller coaster 8 times ($88).

Total cost per friend = Cost for laser tag + Cost for pinball tokens + Total cost for roller coaster rides
Total cost per friend = $6 + $6 + $88 = $100

Now, we can find out how many friends Sofia can invite with the remaining budget:

Number of friends = Remaining budget / Total cost per friend

[Example Input]
Question: At a fruit market, there are three times as many apples as oranges. If there are 12 oranges, and the market receives 15 more apples and 5 fewer oranges, what is the total number of apples and oranges at the market now?
Wrong answer: I calculated that there are 36 apples (3 times 12) and then added 15 to get 51 apples. I forgot to adjust the number of oranges after the change, so I incorrectly said there were 12 oranges and added them to 51, giving me a total of 63.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of oranges after the market received 15 more apples and 5 fewer oranges. I should have adjusted the number of oranges to 12 - 5 = 7 before calculating the total.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect adjustment
- Total miscalculation

Instructions:
1. Identify the initial quantities of each item (apples and oranges).
2. Determine the ratio between the items.
3. Calculate the total number of items before any changes.
4. Apply the changes to each item (additions or subtractions).
5. Recalculate the total after adjustments.

Advice:
- Always double-check the adjustments made to quantities after changes.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion.
- Write down each step clearly to track your calculations.

Solution:

### Solution:
1. **Identify the initial quantities:**
   - Wei has 38 bananas.
   - Since there are ten times as many plums as bananas, the initial number of plums is:
     \[
     \text{Plums} = 10 \times \text{Bananas} = 10 \times 38 = 380
     \]

2. **Determine the changes:**
   - Wei bought 46 more bananas:
     \[
     \text{New Bananas} = 38 + 46 = 84
     \]
   - Wei has 45 fewer plums than the number of bananas:
     \[
     \text{New Plums} = \text{New Bananas} - 45 = 84 - 45 = 39
     \]

3. **Calculate the total after adjustments:**
   - The total number of fruits (plums and bananas) is:
     \[
     \text{Total} = \text{New Bananas} + \text{New Plums} = 84 + 39 = 123
     \]

     \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Fudge} + \text{Cost of Sand Dollars} + \text{Cost of Postcards}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = ¥371 + ¥11.5 + ¥348.5
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = ¥371 + ¥11.5 + ¥348.5 = ¥731
     \]

5. **Money Left:**
   - Sofia started with ¥1200. To find out how much she has left:
     \[
     \text{Money Left} = ¥1200 - ¥731 = ¥469
     \]

Thus, Sofia has ¥469 left after her purchases.",469.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Initial Amount**: Sofia starts with ¥1200.

2. **Cost of Fudge**:
   - The price for 16 kgs of fudge is ¥21 per kg.
   - So, the cost for 16 kgs is 16 * 21 = ¥336.
   - For the additional 5 kgs, the price is 2/3 off. 
   - The price for 5 kgs at ¥21 per kg is 5 * 21 = ¥105.
   - The discount on this is 2/3 of ¥105, which is (2/3) * 105 = ¥70.
   - Therefore, the cost for the 5 kgs after the discount is ¥105 - ¥70 = ¥35.
   - So, the total cost for 21 kgs of fudge (16 kgs + 5 kgs) is ¥336 + ¥35 = ¥371.

3. **Cost of Mixed Bag of Sand Dollars**: 
   - The mixed bag costs ¥11.5.

4. **Cost of Postcards**:
   - Each postcard costs ¥20.5, and she buys 17 postcards.
   - So, the total cost for postcards is 17 * 20.5 = ¥348.5.

5. **Total Spending**:
   - Now, we add up all her expenses:
   - Total cost = Cost of fudge + Cost of sand dollars + Cost of postcards
   - Total cost = ¥371 + ¥11.5 + ¥348.5 = ¥731.

6. **Money Left**:
   - To find out how much money Sofia has left, we subtract her total spending from her initial amount:
   - Money left = Initial amount - Total spending
   - Money left = ¥1200 - ¥731 = ¥469.

[Example Input]
Question: Alex has $150 to spend on video games. He finds a deal where he can buy 3 games for $40 each, and if he buys 3, he gets a fourth game for half price. He decides to buy 4 games. How much money does Alex have left after his purchases?

Wrong answer: Alex calculated the cost of 3 games as $120 (3 x $40) and then added the half price of the fourth game ($20), totaling $140. He thought he had $10 left, but he forgot to account for the total cost of the fourth game correctly.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total cost of the fourth game by not applying the discount correctly. I should have calculated the total cost of all four games together.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Discount application error
- Budgeting mistake

Instructions:
1. Identify the total budget available.
2. Break down the costs of each item, including any discounts.
3. Calculate the total cost of all items before subtracting from the budget.
4. Subtract the total cost from the budget to find the remaining amount.

Advice:
- Always double-check calculations, especially when discounts are involved.
- Write down each step of the calculation to avoid missing any details.
- Familiarize yourself with common discount formats to ensure correct application.

Solution:
The total cost for 3 games at $40 each is $120. The fourth game, at half price, costs $20. Therefore, the total cost is $120 + $20 = $140. Alex has $150 - $140 = $10 left.

     \[
     5 \text{ kgs} \times ¥21/\text{kg} = ¥105
     \]
     - The discount of 2/3 means she pays 1/3 of the price:
     \[
     \text{Cost for 5 kgs with discount} = ¥105 \times \frac{1}{3} = ¥35
     \]
   - Total cost for fudge:

   - So, the total cost for postcards is 17 * 20.5 = ¥348.5.

5. **Total Spending**:
   - Now, we add up all her expenses:
   - Total cost = Cost of fudge + Cost of sand dollars + Cost of postcards
   - Total cost = ¥371 + ¥11.5 + ¥348.5 = ¥731.

6. **Money Left**:
   - To find out how much money Sofia has left, we subtract her total spending from her initial amount:
   - Money left = Initial amount - Total spending
   - Money left = ¥1200 - ¥731 = ¥469.

The answer is ¥469.",469.0,0,2,0,469.0,"--- Beginning of the template ---

Question: Alex has $150 to spend at a bookstore. He wants to buy 5 novels priced at $25 each and a special edition book that costs $40. If he also buys a bookmark for $5, how much money does he have left after his purchases?
Wrong answer: Alex calculated the total cost of the novels as $125, added the special edition book for $40, and the bookmark for $5, totaling $170. He then incorrectly concluded that he had -$20 left.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total cost of the items. I added the costs incorrectly, leading to a total that exceeded Alex's budget.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Addition error
- Budgeting mistake

Instructions:
1. Identify the total budget available.
2. List all items to be purchased along with their prices.
3. Calculate the total cost of each item category (e.g., novels, special edition book, bookmark).
4. Add the total costs together to find the overall expenditure.
5. Subtract the total expenditure from the initial budget to find the remaining amount.

Advice:
- Always double-check your calculations, especially when adding multiple items.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion.
- Keep track of your budget and ensure that your total expenses do not exceed it.

Solution:
The total cost of the novels is 5 novels × $25 = $125. The special edition book costs $40, and the bookmark costs $5. Therefore, the total cost is $125 + $40 + $5 = $170. Since Alex has $150, he has $150 - $170 = -$20, indicating he cannot afford all the items.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I miscalculated the total cost of the fudge, which included applying the discount incorrectly. I also failed to accurately sum the costs of all items purchased, leading to an incorrect remaining balance.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Discount error
- Addition error
- Budgeting mistake

### Solution:
1. **Identify the total budget available**: Sofia has ¥1200.

2. **Calculate the cost of fudge**:
   - The price for 16 kgs of fudge is ¥21 per kg, so:
     \[
     16 \text{ kgs} \times ¥21/\text{kg} = ¥336
     \]
   - She gets 5 kgs at 2/3 off. The price for 5 kgs at ¥21 per kg is:
     \[
     5 \text{ kgs} \times ¥21/\text{kg} = ¥105
     \]
   - The discount on this is:
     \[
     \text{Discount} = \frac{2}{3} \times ¥105 = ¥70
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost for the 5 kgs after the discount is:
     \[
     ¥105 - ¥70 = ¥35
     \]
   - Now, the total cost of fudge for 23 kgs is:
     \[
     ¥336 + ¥35 = ¥371
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the mixed bag of sand dollars**:
   - The cost is ¥11.5.

4. **Calculate the cost of the postcards**:
   - The cost for 17 postcards at ¥20.5 each is:
     \[
     17 \times ¥20.5 = ¥348.5
     \]

5. **Calculate the total expenditure**:
   - Total cost = Cost of fudge + Cost of sand dollars + Cost of postcards:
     \[
     ¥371 + ¥11.5 + ¥348.5 = ¥731
     \]

6. **Calculate the remaining amount**:
   - Remaining amount = Total budget - Total expenditure:
     \[
     ¥1200 - ¥731 = ¥469
     \]

### New Answer:
Sofia has ¥469 left after her purchases.

### Instructions:
1. Identify the total budget available.
2. List all items to be purchased along with their prices.
3. Calculate the total cost of each item category, ensuring to apply any discounts correctly.
4. Add the total costs together to find the overall expenditure.
5. Subtract the total expenditure from the initial budget to find the remaining amount.

### General Advice:
- Always break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion.
- Carefully apply any discounts or promotions, ensuring to calculate them correctly.
- Double-check your calculations, especially when summing multiple items.
- Keep track of your budget and ensure that your total expenses do not exceed it.","--- Beginning of the template ---

How many giants has Mateo slain?",750.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Noah's Giants**: 
   Noah slew 250 giants.

2. **Luis's Giants**: 
   Luis slew \( \frac{2}{4} \) as many giants as Noah. 
   \[
   \text{Luis's giants} = \frac{2}{4} \times 250 = \frac{1}{2} \times 250 = 125
   \]

3. **Arash's Giants**: 
   Arash slew nine times as many giants as Luis.

1. Noah slew 250 giants.
2. Luis slew 2/4 as many giants as Noah. 
   - 2/4 of 250 is 250 * (2/4) = 250 * 0.5 = 125 giants.
3. Arash slew nine times as many giants as Luis.
   - So, Arash slew 9 * 125 = 1125 giants.
4. Mateo slew 2/3 as many giants as Arash.

Liam spent ₣1000 and got 4 bags of popcorn and had 8% of his money left in change. How many pretzels did he buy?,919.0,"To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the total amount spent**: 
   Liam started with ₣1000 and had 8% of his money left. First, we calculate how much money he had left after spending.

   \[
   \text{Amount left} = 8\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.08 \times 1000 = ₣80
   \]

   Now, we can find out how much money Liam spent:

   \[
   \text{Amount spent} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Amount left} = 1000 - 80 = ₣920
   \]

2. **Calculating the cost of popcorn**:
   Liam bought 4 bags of popcorn, and each bag costs 25 cents (or ₣0.25). Therefore, the total cost for the popcorn is:

   \[
   \text{Cost of popcorn} = 4 \times 0.25 = ₣1.00
   \]

3. **Finding the remaining amount spent on pretzels**:
   Now, we can find out how much money Liam spent on pretzels. We know he spent a total of ₣920, and he spent ₣1.00 on popcorn. Thus, the amount spent on pretzels is:

   \[
   \text{Amount spent on pretzels} = \text{Total amount spent} - \text{Cost of popcorn} = 920 - 1 = ₣919
   \]

4. **Calculating the number of pretzels bought**:
   Each pretzel costs 100 cents (or ₣1.00). To find out how many pretzels Liam bought, we divide the amount spent on pretzels by the cost of one pretzel:

   \[
   \text{Number of pretzels} = \frac{\text{Amount spent on pretzels}}{\text{Cost of one pretzel}} = \frac{919}{1} = 919
   \]

Thus, Liam bought **919 pretzels**.",919.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Liam spent a total of ₣1000.
2. He had 8% of his money left in change. To find out how much money he has left, we calculate 8% of ₣1000:
   \[
   0.08 \times 1000 = 80 \text{ cents}
   \]
3. Now, we can find out how much money Liam actually spent. We subtract the change from the total amount:
   \[
   1000 - 80 = 920 \text{ cents}
   \]
4. Liam bought 4 bags of popcorn. Each bag of popcorn costs 25 cents, so the total cost for the popcorn is:
   \[
   4 \times 25 = 100 \text{ cents}
   \]
5. Now, we can find out how much money Liam spent on pretzels. We subtract the cost of the popcorn from the total amount spent:
   \[
   920 - 100 = 820 \text{ cents}
   \]
6. Each pretzel costs 100 cents. To find out how many pretzels Liam bought, we divide the amount spent on pretzels by the cost of one pretzel:
   \[
   820 \div 100 = 8.2
   \]
   Since Liam cannot buy a fraction of a pretzel, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means he bought 8 pretzels.

Reflection 1: 920.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I initially miscalculated the total amount Liam had left after buying the popcorn and did not correctly account for the percentage of money left. I also failed to properly calculate how much money he had after his purchases, which led to an incorrect conclusion about the number of pretzels he could buy.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Percentage misunderstanding
- Incorrect total spent
- Incorrect assumptions about remaining funds

### Solution:
1. **Identify the total amount of money available**: Liam has ₣1000.
2. **Calculate the total spent on popcorn**: 
   - Each bag of popcorn costs 25 cents.
   - Liam bought 4 bags of popcorn: 
     \[
     4 \text{ bags} \times 0.25 \text{ (₣)} = ₣1.00
     \]
3. **Determine the amount of money left after buying popcorn**: 
   - Total spent on popcorn: ₣1.00
   - Money left after buying popcorn: 
     \[
     ₣1000 - ₣1.00 = ₣999.00
     \]
4. **Calculate the percentage of money left**: 
   - Liam has 8% of his money left in change:
     \[
     8\% \text{ of } ₣1000 = 0.08 \times 1000 = ₣80
     \]
5. **Determine the amount of money available for pretzels**: 
   - Money spent on pretzels:
     \[
     ₣999.00 - ₣80 = ₣919.00
     \]
6. **Calculate the number of pretzels bought**: 
   - Each pretzel costs 100 cents (or ₣1.00).
   - Number of pretzels bought:
     \[
     \frac{₣919.00}{₣1.00} = 919 \text{ pretzels}
     \]

### New Answer:
Liam bought **919 pretzels**.

If the length of his room is 5 meters, what is the perimeter of the room in meters?",274.0,"To find the perimeter of Andre's rectangular study, we first need to determine the width of the room using the area and the length.

The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[
A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
\]

We know the area is 660 square meters and the length is 5 meters. We can set up the equation:

\[
660 = 5 \times \text{width}
\]

To find the width, we can rearrange the equation:

\[
\text{width} = \frac{660}{5}
\]

Calculating the width:

\[
\text{width} = 132 \text{ meters}
\]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter \( P \) of the rectangle using the formula:

\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
P = 2 \times (5 + 132)
\]

Calculating the sum inside the parentheses:

\[
5 + 132 = 137
\]

Now, calculating the perimeter:

\[
P = 2 \times 137 = 274 \text{ meters}
\]

Thus, the perimeter of Andre's room is:

\[
\boxed{274} \text{ meters}
\]",274.0,1,"Let's think step by step.  
The area of Andre's rectangular study is given as 660 square meters.  
The formula for the area of a rectangle is:  
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]  
We know the length of the room is 5 meters.  
So, we can set up the equation:  
\[ 660 = 5 \times \text{Width} \]  
To find the width, we divide both sides by 5:  
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{660}{5} = 132 \text{ meters} \]  

Now we have the dimensions of the room:  
Length = 5 meters  
Width = 132 meters  

Next, we need to find the perimeter of the room.  
The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:  
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]  
Substituting the values we found:  
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (5 + 132) = 2 \times 137 = 274 \text{ meters} \]

How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?",408.0,"To find the total number of cards of all mentioned colors, we will first determine the number of blue cards and then the number of green cards.

1. **Calculate the number of blue cards:**
   - We know there are 80 orange cards.
   - The number of blue cards is 55% more than the number of orange cards.
   - To find 55% of the number of orange cards:
     \[
     55\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.55 \times 80 = 44

2. **Calculate the number of green cards:**
   - The number of green cards is equal to the sum of the orange and blue cards.
   - First, we find the sum of the orange and blue cards:
     \[
     \text{Sum of orange and blue cards} = 80 + 124 = 204

Since corns are a rare treat, he only buys six 3-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the alpacas while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys thirteen 9-pound bags. Apples are the main diet of his alpacas, so he buys thirty five 39-pound packs. Wheats are a staple to supplement the apples, so he buys twenty 15-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 100 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?",18.0,"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed he buys and then sum them up.

1. **Corns**:

1. **Writing the full hiragana set**: Zahra writes the full set of 48 letters ten times. 
   \[

How much longer does Tariq take to swim 8 miles on a hot day than a cold day?,304.0,"To find out how much longer Tariq takes to swim 8 miles on a hot day than on a cold day, we first need to determine his swimming times for both conditions.

1. **Cold Water Swimming Time:**
   - Tariq swims 1 mile in 16 minutes.
   - Therefore, for 8 miles, the time taken in cold water is:
     \[
     \text{Time in cold water} = 8 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes/mile} = 128 \text{ minutes}

After 6 weeks, Uma and Beatriz compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Uma has 38 signatures in her book, and Beatriz has 38. The sisters have 4 more weeks of summer break, and they decide they want to reach 110 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 110.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly by stating that they needed to collect 110 signatures without considering the signatures they already had. I failed to account for their current total before calculating how many more signatures they needed to reach their goal.

### Error Keywords:

### Solution:
1. **Identify the current signatures**: Uma has 38 signatures, and Beatriz also has 38 signatures.
2. **Calculate the total signatures they currently have**: 
   \[
   38 + 38 = 76 \text{ signatures}
   \]
3. **Determine the total signatures needed to reach the goal**: The goal is 110 signatures.
4. **Calculate how many more signatures they need**: 
   \[
   110 - 76 = 34 \text{ signatures}
   \]
5. **Determine how many signatures they need to collect per week**: They have 4 weeks left to collect the signatures.
   \[
   \frac{34}{4} = 8.5 \text{ signatures per week}
   \]

### New Answer:
The sisters need to collect a total of 34 more signatures to reach their goal of 110 signatures, which means they need to collect approximately 8.5 signatures per week over the next 4 weeks.

### Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully to understand the current quantities and the goal.
2. Identify the current totals for each individual involved.
3. Add the current totals together to find the overall total.
4. Subtract the current total from the goal to find out how many more are needed.

So, the total number of signatures they currently have is 38 + 38 = 76 signatures.

Their goal is to reach 110 signatures.
To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the current total from their goal:
110 - 76 = 34 signatures.

They have 4 more weeks of summer break.
To find out how many signatures they need to collect each week, we divide the total signatures needed by the number of weeks:
34 signatures / 4 weeks = 8.5 signatures per week.

Since they can't collect half a signature, they will need to collect at least 9 signatures in some weeks to reach their goal.

The answer is they need to collect 34 signatures in total to reach their goal of 110 signatures.",110.0,0,1,0,4.0,"--- Beginning of the template ---

If Carlos can eat 2 servings a day while Sakura can eat five times as much, how many days will the pizza last?",4.0,"To determine how many days the pizza will last, we first need to calculate how many servings Carlos and Sakura eat together each day.

1. **Calculate Sakura's daily servings:**
   - Carlos eats 2 servings a day.
   - Sakura eats five times as much as Carlos:
     \[
     \text{Sakura's servings} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ servings}

Ava recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her nephew up to 199. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?",62.0,"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we first need to calculate the total number of toys Ava already has before adding the bouncy balls.

1. **Calculate the total number of toys Ava has before adding the bouncy balls:**
   - Number of building blocks: 71
   - Number of stuffed animals: 43
   - Number of stacking rings: 23

   Now, we add these numbers together:

On Saturday, he sold 11 more boxes of brownies than on Friday and 26 boxes of kiwi pie. If the brownie cost ¥11 and the kiwi pie cost ¥27, how much did Oscar earn for two days?",1839.0,"To find out how much Oscar earned over the two days, we first need to determine how many boxes of brownies and kiwi pies he sold on each day.

### Step 1: Determine the number of boxes sold on Friday

Let:
- \( b_F \) = number of boxes of brownies sold on Friday
- \( k_F \) = number of boxes of kiwi pies sold on Friday

From the problem, we know:
- \( b_F = 29 \)
- \( k_F = b_F - 12 = 29 - 12 = 17 \)

So, on Friday, Oscar sold:
- 29 boxes of brownies
- 17 boxes of kiwi pies

### Step 2: Determine the number of boxes sold on Saturday

Let:
- \( b_S \) = number of boxes of brownies sold on Saturday
- \( k_S \) = number of boxes of kiwi pies sold on Saturday

From the problem, we know:
- \( b_S = b_F + 11 = 29 + 11 = 40 \)
- \( k_S = 26 \)

So, on Saturday, Oscar sold:
- 40 boxes of brownies
- 26 boxes of kiwi pies

### Step 3: Calculate the total earnings for each day

**Earnings on Friday:**
- Earnings from brownies: \( b_F \times 11 = 29 \times 11 = 319 \)
- Earnings from kiwi pies: \( k_F \times 27 = 17 \times 27 = 459 \)

Total earnings on Friday:
\[
\text{Total earnings on Friday} = 319 + 459 = 778

**Earnings on Saturday:**
- Earnings from brownies: \( b_S \times 11 = 40 \times 11 = 440 \)
- Earnings from kiwi pies: \( k_S \times 27 = 26 \times 27 = 702 \)

Total earnings on Saturday:
\[
\text{Total earnings on Saturday} = 440 + 702 = 1142

[Example Input]
Question: Sarah has a garden that is 120 feet long. She wants to plant trees that are 4 feet wide and needs to leave 10 feet between each tree. Sarah already has 5 trees. How much will it cost her to buy enough trees if each tree costs $5?

Wrong answer: I calculated that Sarah can fit 10 trees in the garden, so I multiplied 10 by $5 and got $50. I forgot to account for the space needed between the trees.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of trees that could fit in the garden because I did not consider the spacing required between each tree.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Spacing
- Incorrect total

Instructions:
1. Determine the total length of the garden.
2. Calculate the total width occupied by one tree and the space needed between trees.
3. Use the formula: Total length = (Number of trees × Width of one tree) + (Spacing between trees × (Number of trees - 1)).
4. Solve for the number of trees that can fit in the garden.
5. Subtract the number of trees Sarah already has from the total number of trees that can fit.
6. Multiply the number of additional trees needed by the cost per tree to find the total cost.

Advice:
- Always account for spacing when calculating how many items can fit in a given length.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion.
- Double-check calculations to ensure all factors are considered.

Solution:
To solve the problem, I first calculated the total width occupied by one tree and the space needed between trees. The total length of the garden is 120 feet. Each tree is 4 feet wide, and with 10 feet between each tree, I found that Sarah can fit 8 trees in total. Since she already has 5 trees, she needs 3 more. Therefore, the total cost will be 3 trees × $5 = $15.

Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 24.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not properly account for the spacing required between each plant when calculating how many plants could fit in the flower bed. I mistakenly calculated the total number of plants without considering the space needed between them.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Spacing
- Incorrect total

### Solution:
1. **Determine the total length of the flower bed**: The flower bed is 180 feet long.
2. **Calculate the total width occupied by one plant and the space needed between plants**: Each plant is 3 feet wide, and there is a 15 feet gap between each plant.
3. **Use the formula**: 
   \[
   \text{Total length} = (\text{Number of plants} \times \text{Width of one plant}) + (\text{Spacing between plants} \times (\text{Number of plants} - 1))
   \]
   Let \( n \) be the number of plants that can fit. The equation becomes:
   \[
   180 = (n \times 3) + (15 \times (n - 1))
   \]
4. **Simplify the equation**:
   \[
   180 = 3n + 15n - 15
   \]
   \[
   180 + 15 = 18n
   \]
   \[
   195 = 18n
   \]
   \[
   n = \frac{195}{18} \approx 10.83
   \]
   Since \( n \) must be a whole number, Kimia can fit 10 plants in the flower bed.
5. **Subtract the number of plants Kimia already has**: Kimia already owns 11 flowers, which means she does not need to buy any additional plants since she already has more than can fit.
6. **Calculate the total cost**: Since Kimia does not need to buy any additional plants, the total cost will be:
   \[
   0 \text{ plants} \times ¥3 = ¥0
   \]

### Instructions:
1. Determine the total length of the area available for planting.
2. Identify the width of each plant and the spacing required between them.
3. Set up the equation to calculate how many plants can fit, considering both the width of the plants and the spacing.
4. Solve the equation for the number of plants that can fit.
5. Compare the number of plants that can fit with the number of plants already owned.
6. Calculate the total cost based on the number of additional plants needed.

### Advice:
- Always account for both the width of the items and the spacing when calculating how many can fit in a given length.
- Break down the problem into manageable parts to avoid confusion.
- Double-check calculations to ensure all factors are considered, especially when dealing with spacing and dimensions.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

[Example Input]
Question: Sarah has a garden that is 120 feet long. She wants to plant trees that are 4 feet wide and needs to leave 10 feet between each tree. Sarah already has 5 trees. How much will it cost her to buy enough trees if each tree costs $5?

Wrong answer: I calculated that Sarah can fit 10 trees in the garden, so I multiplied 10 by $5 and got $50. I forgot to account for the space needed between the trees.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of trees that could fit in the garden because I did not consider the spacing required between each tree.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Spacing
- Incorrect total

Instructions:
1. Determine the total length of the garden.
2. Calculate the total width occupied by one tree and the space needed between trees.
3. Use the formula: Total length = (Number of trees × Width of one tree) + (Spacing between trees × (Number of trees - 1)).
4. Solve for the number of trees that can fit in the garden.
5. Subtract the number of trees Sarah already has from the total number of trees that can fit.
6. Multiply the number of additional trees needed by the cost per tree to find the total cost.

Advice:
- Always account for spacing when calculating how many items can fit in a given length.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion.
- Double-check calculations to ensure all factors are considered.

Solution:
To solve the problem, I first calculated the total width occupied by one tree and the space needed between trees. The total length of the garden is 120 feet. Each tree is 4 feet wide, and with 10 feet between each tree, I found that Sarah can fit 8 trees in total. Since she already has 5 trees, she needs 3 more. Therefore, the total cost will be 3 trees × $5 = $15.

Kimia's flowers grow 3 feet wide so she needs to leave 15.0 feet between every plant. Kimia already owns 11 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ¥3 at the store, how much money will Kimia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",3.0,"To determine how much money Kimia will spend at the store to fill her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total space each flower occupies**: Each flower is 3 feet wide, and there is a 15-foot gap between each flower. Therefore, the total space occupied by one flower and the gap is:
   \[
   \text{Space per flower} = \text{Width of flower} + \text{Gap} = 3 \text{ feet} + 15 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Determine how many flowers can fit in the flower bed**: The flower bed is 180 feet long. To find out how many flowers can fit, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space each flower occupies:
   \[
   \text{Number of flowers} = \frac{\text{Length of flower bed}}{\text{Space per flower}} = \frac{180 \text{ feet}}{18 \text{ feet}} = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate how many additional flowers Kimia needs**: Kimia already owns 11 flowers, but since only 10 flowers can fit in the flower bed, she does not need to buy any additional flowers. In fact, she has more flowers than needed.

4. **Determine the cost**: Since Kimia does not need to buy any additional flowers, the total cost will be:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 0 \text{ yen}
   \]

Thus, Kimia will spend **¥0** at the store to fill up her flower bed, as she already has enough flowers.",0.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the total space available for planting**: 
   Kimia has a flower bed that is 180 feet long.

2. **Calculate the space taken by the existing flowers**: 
   Each flower is 3 feet wide, and Kimia already owns 11 flowers. 
   The total width occupied by the existing flowers is:
   \[
   11 \text{ flowers} \times 3 \text{ feet/flower} = 33 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining space in the flower bed**: 
   The remaining space for new plants is:
   \[
   180 \text{ feet} - 33 \text{ feet} = 147 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. **Determine the space needed for each new plant**: 
   Each new plant requires 3 feet for its width and 15 feet of space between each plant. Therefore, the total space needed for each new plant (including the space between them) is:
   \[
   3 \text{ feet} + 15 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet}
   \]

5. **Calculate how many new plants can fit in the remaining space**: 
   To find out how many new plants can fit in the 147 feet of remaining space, we divide the remaining space by the space needed for each new plant:
   \[
   \frac{147 \text{ feet}}{18 \text{ feet/plant}} \approx 8.1667
   \]
   Since Kimia can only plant whole flowers, she can plant 8 new flowers.

6. **Calculate the total cost for the new flowers**: 
   Each flowering plant costs ¥3. Therefore, the total cost for 8 new flowers is:

   8 \text{ flowers} \times ¥3/\text{flower} = ¥24

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not properly calculate the number of plants that could fit in the flower bed, failing to account for the space needed between each plant. I also did not consider the total number of plants Kimia already owns when determining how many more she needs to buy.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Spacing
- Budgeting
- Oversight

### Solution:
1. **Determine the total length of the flower bed**: The flower bed is 180 feet long.
2. **Calculate the total width occupied by each plant and the space between them**:
   - Each plant is 3 feet wide.
   - The space between each plant is 15 feet.
3. **Use the formula**: 
   - Total length = (Number of plants × Width of each plant) + (Number of gaps × Space between plants).
4. **Let \( n \) be the number of plants that can fit**:
   - The number of gaps will be \( n - 1 \) (since there is no gap after the last plant).
   - The equation becomes: 
     \[
     180 = (n \times 3) + ((n - 1) \times 15)
     \]
5. **Simplify the equation**:
   \[
   180 = 3n + 15n - 15
   \]
   \[
   180 = 18n - 15
   \]
   \[
   195 = 18n
   \]
   \[
   n = \frac{195}{18} \approx 10.83
   \]
   Since Kimia cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to 10 plants.
6. **Calculate how many more plants Kimia needs**:
   - Kimia already has 11 plants, so she does not need to buy any more plants. In fact, she has more than can fit in the flower bed.
7. **Total expenditure**:
   - Since she does not need to buy any more plants, the total cost is \( 0 \).

### Instructions:
1. Identify the total length of the area available for planting.
2. Determine the width of each plant and the space required between them.
3. Set up the equation to calculate how many plants can fit, considering both the width of the plants and the gaps.
4. Solve the equation to find the maximum number of plants that can fit in the area.
5. Subtract the number of plants already owned from the total number of plants that can fit to find out how many more are needed.
6. Multiply the number of new plants needed by the cost per plant to find the total expenditure.

### General Advice:
- Always account for both the size of the items and the space needed between them when calculating how many can fit in a given area.
- Carefully set up equations to represent the problem accurately, ensuring all components are included.
- Double-check your calculations and ensure that you consider any existing items before determining how many more are needed.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

How long will it take her to peel and saute 90 clams?,30.0,"To find out how long it will take Fatima to peel and saute 90 clams, we need to calculate the time required for each task separately and then sum them up.

1. **Peeling the clams:**
   Fatima can peel 10 clams per minute. To find out how long it takes her to peel 90 clams, we can use the formula:

   \[
   \text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Number of clams}}{\text{Clams per minute}} = \frac{90 \text{ clams}}{10 \text{ clams/minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Sauteing the clams:**
   Fatima can saute 30 clams in 7 minutes. To find out how long it takes her to saute 90 clams, we first determine the rate at which she sautes clams:

   \[
   \text{Rate of sauteing} = \frac{30 \text{ clams}}{7 \text{ minutes}} \approx 4.29 \text{ clams/minute}
   \]

   Now, we can calculate the time required to saute 90 clams:

   \[
   \text{Time to saute} = \frac{90 \text{ clams}}{4.29 \text{ clams/minute}} \approx 20.95 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Total time:**
   Now, we add the time taken to peel and the time taken to saute:

Thus, it will take Fatima approximately **30 minutes** to peel and saute 90 clams.",90.0,0,"A: Let's think step by step.

1. **Peeling Clams**: Fatima can peel 10 clams in 1 minute. To find out how long it takes her to peel 90 clams, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Total clams}}{\text{Clams per minute}} = \frac{90}{10} = 9 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Sauteing Clams**: Fatima can saute 30 clams in 7 minutes. To find out how long it takes her to saute 90 clams, we first determine how many batches of 30 clams are in 90 clams:
   \[
   \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90}{30} = 3
   \]
   Since each batch takes 7 minutes, the total time to saute 90 clams is:
   \[
   \text{Time to saute} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ minutes}

Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. How old was Viktor when he saw the Comet for the first time?,14.0,"Let's denote the age of Viktor's father when he first saw the comet as \( F \) and Viktor's age when he first saw the comet as \( V \).

1. **Determine the father's age when he first saw the comet:**
   Viktor's father saw the comet when he was 23 years old, so:
   \[
   F = 23
   \]

2. **Determine the age of Viktor's father when Viktor saw the comet the second time:**
   The comet orbits the sun every 55 years. Since Viktor's father saw the comet when he was 23, he will see it again 55 years later:
   \[
   F + 55 = 23 + 55 = 78
   \]

3. **Determine Viktor's age when he saw the comet the second time:**
   Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he first saw the comet. Since his father was 23 when he first saw it, we have:
   \[
   \text{Viktor's age at second sighting} = 3 \times F = 3 \times 23 = 69
   \]

4. **Determine Viktor's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   Since Viktor's father was 23 years old when he first saw the comet and 78 years old when he saw it the second time, the difference in years is:
   \[
   78 - 23 = 55
   \]
   This means that 55 years passed between the two sightings of the comet.

   If Viktor was 69 years old when he saw the comet the second time, we can find his age when he saw it the first time by subtracting the 55 years:
   \[
   V + 55 = 69 \implies V = 69 - 55 = 14
   \]

Thus, Viktor was **14 years old** when he saw the comet for the first time.",14.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Viktor's father saw the Comet Hale-Bopp when he was 23 years old.
2. The Comet orbits the sun every 55 years, so it will be 55 years before it appears again.
3. Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he first saw the comet.
4. Since Viktor's father was 23 years old when he first saw the comet, we need to find out how old Viktor was when he saw it for the first time.

Let's denote:
- Viktor's age when he first saw the comet as \( V \).
- The age of Viktor's father when he saw the comet for the second time as \( 23 + 55 = 78 \) years old.

5. Viktor saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age of his father when he first saw it:
   \[
   \text{Viktor's age at second sighting} = 3 \times 23 = 69 \text{ years old}
   \]

6. Since Viktor's father was 23 years old when he first saw the comet and 78 years old when he saw it again, the time that passed between the two sightings is 55 years.

7. Therefore, if Viktor was 69 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, we can find out how old he was when he saw it for the first time:
   \[
   69 - 55 = 14

According to the problem, Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, so we can express the amount of fence Kimia gets as \( R + 30 \) yards.

The total amount of fence they have is 900 yards. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
R + (R + 30) = 900
\]

Now, let's simplify the equation:

\[
2R + 30 = 900
\]

Next, we will subtract 30 from both sides:

\[
2R = 900 - 30
\]
\[
2R = 870
\]

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to find \( R \):

\[
R = \frac{870}{2} = 435
\]

So, Rania gets 435 yards of fence. 

To find out how much Kimia gets, we can substitute \( R \) back into the expression for Kimia's amount:

\[
K = R + 30 = 435 + 30 = 465
\]

Now, we can check the total:

\[
R + K = 435 + 465 = 900
\]

This confirms that our calculations are correct. 

Thus, the amount of fence Rania has is:

\[
\boxed{435} \text{ yards}
\]",435.0,1,"Let's think step by step.  
Let Rania's share of the fence be represented as \( R \) yards.  
Since Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, we can represent Kimia's share as \( R + 30 \) yards.  

Together, they have a total of 900 yards of fence. Therefore, we can set up the equation:  
\[ R + (R + 30) = 900 \]  

Now, let's simplify the equation:  
\[ 2R + 30 = 900 \]  

Next, we subtract 30 from both sides:  
\[ 2R = 900 - 30 \]  
\[ 2R = 870 \]  

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to find Rania's share:  
\[ R = \frac{870}{2} \]  
\[ R = 435 \]  

Now, we can find out how much Kimia gets:  
\[ K = R + 30 = 435 + 30 = 465 \]  

Finally, we check the total:  
\[ R + K = 435 + 465 = 900 \]  

So, Rania has 435 yards of fence.

He goes to class for 4 days a week. He then spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,42.0,"To find out how many hours a week Hiroshi spends learning, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total class time during the week:**
   - Hiroshi has 7 periods in a day, plus 2 extra classes, making a total of \( 7 + 2 = 9 \) periods per day.
   - Each class is 35 minutes long, so the total time spent in classes per day is:
     \[
     9 \text{ periods} \times 35 \text{ minutes/period} = 315 \text{ minutes/day}
     \]
   - Since he goes to class for 4 days a week, the total class time for the week is:
     \[
     315 \text{ minutes/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 1260 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

2. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - Hiroshi spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday. First, we need to find three-sixths of his total weekly class time:
     \[
     \text{Total weekly minutes} = 1260 \text{ minutes}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Extra learning time} = \frac{3}{6} \times 1260 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1260 = 630 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Since this extra learning time is spent equally on Saturday and Sunday, he spends:
     \[
     \frac{630 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 315 \text{ minutes} \text{ on Saturday}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{630 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 315 \text{ minutes} \text{ on Sunday}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total learning time for the week:**
   - Now, we add the total class time and the extra learning time:
     \[
     \text{Total learning time} = 1260 \text{ minutes (class time)} + 630 \text{ minutes (extra learning)} = 1890 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Convert the total learning time from minutes to hours:**
   - To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
     \[
     \text{Total hours} = \frac{1890 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 31.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, Hiroshi spends a total of **31.5 hours a week** learning.",31.5,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of periods Hiroshi has in a day:**
   - A normal student has 7 periods.
   - Hiroshi has to take 2 extra classes.
   - So, the total number of periods Hiroshi has in a day is 7 + 2 = 9 periods.

2. **Calculate the total time spent in class each day:**
   - Each class is 35 minutes long.
   - Hiroshi has 9 periods in a day.
   - So, the total time spent in class each day is 9 * 35 = 315 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time spent in class for 4 days a week:**
   - Hiroshi goes to class for 4 days a week.
   - So, the total time spent in class for 4 days is 315 * 4 = 1260 minutes.

4. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - Hiroshi spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - First, we need to find out how many minutes he spends in a week. Since he goes to class for 4 days, we already calculated that he spends 1260 minutes in class.
   - The total minutes in a week is 1260 minutes (from class) + 0 minutes (from other activities) = 1260 minutes.
   - Three-sixths of 1260 minutes is (3/6) * 1260 = 630 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total learning time for the week:**
   - The total learning time for the week is the time spent in class plus the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday.
   - So, the total learning time is 1260 + 630 = 1890 minutes.

6. **Convert the total learning time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - So, to convert 1890 minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 1890 / 60 = 31.5 hours.

[Example Input]
Question: A student has 5 classes each lasting 50 minutes. He attends classes 5 days a week. On weekends, he studies for 2 hours each day. How many hours does he spend on classes and studying in a week?
Wrong answer: I calculated the total class time as 5 classes x 50 minutes = 250 minutes. Then I added 2 hours for Saturday and 2 hours for Sunday, which is 4 hours. I converted 250 minutes to hours (4.17 hours) and added 4 hours, giving me a total of 8.17 hours. I miscalculated the total class time by not considering the number of days he attends classes.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total class time by not multiplying the daily class time by the number of days he attends classes. I only calculated the class time for one day instead of for the entire week.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Daily vs. Weekly
- Addition error

Instructions:
1. Determine the total class time per day by multiplying the number of classes by the duration of each class.
2. Multiply the daily class time by the number of days the student attends classes to find the total weekly class time.
3. Calculate the total study time for the weekend by adding the study hours for Saturday and Sunday.
4. Convert all time to the same unit (hours) if necessary.
5. Add the total class time and total study time to find the overall weekly learning time.

Advice:
- Always clarify whether the question is asking for daily, weekly, or total time.
- Double-check calculations for both multiplication and addition.
- Keep track of units (minutes vs. hours) to avoid conversion errors.

Solution:
Total class time per day = 5 classes x 50 minutes = 250 minutes.
Total weekly class time = 250 minutes x 5 days = 1250 minutes.
Total study time = 2 hours (Saturday) + 2 hours (Sunday) = 4 hours = 240 minutes.
Total learning time = 1250 minutes + 240 minutes = 1490 minutes.
Convert to hours: 1490 minutes ÷ 60 = 24.83 hours.
Thus, the student spends approximately 24.83 hours a week learning.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I initially miscalculated the total learning time by not properly accounting for the total number of classes Hiroshi attends each week. I also failed to correctly interpret the fraction of weekly minutes he spends on extra learning during the weekend. This led to an incorrect total.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Misinterpretation of fractions
- Weekly vs. daily time confusion

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the total number of classes per week:**
   - Hiroshi has 7 periods + 2 extra classes = 9 classes per day.
   - Total classes per week = 9 classes/day × 4 days/week = 36 classes/week.

2. **Calculate the total class time in minutes:**
   - Each class is 35 minutes long.
   - Total class time = 36 classes × 35 minutes/class = 1260 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total weekly minutes:**
   - There are 7 days in a week, so total weekly minutes = 7 days × 24 hours/day × 60 minutes/hour = 10080 minutes.

4. **Calculate the extra learning time on the weekend:**
   - Hiroshi spends three-sixths (or 1/2) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - Extra learning time = (1/2) × 10080 minutes = 5040 minutes.
   - Since this is for both Saturday and Sunday, he spends 5040 minutes total on the weekend.

5. **Calculate the total learning time:**
   - Total learning time = Total class time + Extra learning time = 1260 minutes + 5040 minutes = 6300 minutes.

I miscalculated the total class time by not multiplying the daily class time by the number of days in a week. I only calculated the class time for one day instead of for the entire week.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Daily vs. Weekly
- Addition error

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total class time per week by multiplying the number of classes by the duration of each class and then by the number of days attended.
2. Calculate the total study time for the weekend by adding the hours spent studying on Saturday and Sunday.
3. Convert all time to the same unit (hours or minutes) for consistency.
4. Add the total class time and total study time together to find the overall weekly learning time.

Advice:
- Always clarify whether you are calculating for a single day or a week.
- Double-check your multiplication and addition steps to avoid simple errors.
- Convert time units consistently to avoid confusion.

Solution:
Total class time per week = 5 classes x 50 minutes x 5 days = 1250 minutes = 20.83 hours. Total study time = 2 hours (Saturday) + 2 hours (Sunday) = 4 hours. Total learning time = 20.83 hours + 4 hours = 24.83 hours per week.

He goes to class for 4 days a week. He then spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,42.0,"To find out how many hours a week Hiroshi spends learning, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total class time during the week:**
   - Hiroshi has 7 periods in a day, plus 2 extra classes, making a total of \( 7 + 2 = 9 \) periods per day.
   - Each class is 35 minutes long, so the total time spent in classes per day is:
     \[
     9 \text{ periods} \times 35 \text{ minutes/period} = 315 \text{ minutes/day}
     \]
   - Since he goes to class for 4 days a week, the total class time for the week is:
     \[
     315 \text{ minutes/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 1260 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

2. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - Hiroshi spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday. First, we need to find three-sixths of his total weekly class time:
     \[
     \text{Total weekly minutes} = 1260 \text{ minutes}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Extra learning time} = \frac{3}{6} \times 1260 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1260 = 630 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Since this extra learning time is spent equally on Saturday and Sunday, he spends:
     \[
     \frac{630 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 315 \text{ minutes} \text{ on Saturday}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{630 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 315 \text{ minutes} \text{ on Sunday}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total learning time for the week:**
   - Now, we add the total class time and the extra learning time:
     \[
     \text{Total learning time} = 1260 \text{ minutes (class time)} + 630 \text{ minutes (extra learning)} = 1890 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Convert the total learning time from minutes to hours:**
   - To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
     \[
     \text{Total hours} = \frac{1890 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 31.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, Hiroshi spends a total of **31.5 hours a week** learning.",31.5,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of periods Hiroshi has in a day:**
   - A normal student has 7 periods.
   - Hiroshi has to take 2 extra classes.
   - So, the total number of periods Hiroshi has in a day is 7 + 2 = 9 periods.

2. **Calculate the total time spent in class each day:**
   - Each class is 35 minutes long.
   - Hiroshi has 9 periods in a day.
   - So, the total time spent in class each day is 9 * 35 = 315 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time spent in class for 4 days a week:**
   - Hiroshi goes to class for 4 days a week.
   - So, the total time spent in class for 4 days is 315 * 4 = 1260 minutes.

4. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - Hiroshi spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - First, we need to find out how many minutes he spends in a week. Since he goes to class for 4 days, we already calculated that he spends 1260 minutes in class.
   - The total minutes in a week is 1260 minutes (from class) + 0 minutes (from other activities) = 1260 minutes.
   - Three-sixths of 1260 minutes is (3/6) * 1260 = 630 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total learning time for the week:**
   - The total learning time for the week is the time spent in class plus the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday.
   - So, the total learning time is 1260 + 630 = 1890 minutes.

6. **Convert the total learning time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - So, to convert 1890 minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 1890 / 60 = 31.5 hours.

The answer is 31.5 hours.",31.5,0,2,0,63.0,"--- Beginning of the template ---

Reflection 2: 105.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I initially miscalculated the total learning time by not properly accounting for the total number of classes Hiroshi attends each week. I also failed to correctly interpret the fraction of weekly minutes he spends on extra learning time during the weekend. This led to an incorrect total.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Misinterpretation of fractions
- Weekly vs. daily calculations

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the total class time per week:**
   - Hiroshi has 2 extra classes in addition to the normal 7 periods, making a total of:
     \[
     7 + 2 = 9 \text{ classes}
     \]
   - Each class lasts 35 minutes, so the total class time per day is:
     \[
     9 \text{ classes} \times 35 \text{ minutes/class} = 315 \text{ minutes/day}
     \]
   - Since he attends classes for 4 days a week, the total class time per week is:
     \[
     315 \text{ minutes/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 1260 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

2. **Convert total class time to hours:**
   - To convert minutes to hours:
     \[
     1260 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 21 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total weekly minutes:**
   - Total weekly minutes in a week (7 days) is:
     \[
     7 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 10080 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

4. **Calculate extra learning time on the weekend:**
   - Hiroshi spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday:
     \[
     \frac{3}{6} \times 10080 \text{ minutes} = 5040 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Since this is for both Saturday and Sunday, the extra learning time per day is:
     \[
     5040 \text{ minutes} \div 2 = 2520 \text{ minutes/day}
     \]

5. **Convert extra learning time to hours:**
   - Convert the extra learning time to hours:
     \[
     2520 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 42 \text{ hours}
     \]

6. **Calculate total learning time per week:**
   - Finally, add the total class time and the extra learning time:
     \[
     21 \text{ hours (class time)} + 42 \text{ hours (extra learning)} = 63 \text{ hours/week}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Hiroshi spends **63 hours a week** learning.

### Instructions:
1. Identify the total number of classes and their duration.
2. Calculate the total class time per day and then per week.
3. Convert total class time from minutes to hours.
4. Determine the total weekly minutes available and calculate the fraction of time spent on extra learning.
5. Convert the extra learning time from minutes to hours.
6. Add the total class time and extra learning time to find the overall weekly learning time.

### General Advice:
- Always clarify the total number of classes and their duration before starting calculations.
- Be careful with fractions and ensure you understand how they apply to the total time.
- Double-check your calculations for both daily and weekly totals to avoid errors.
- Convert time units consistently to maintain accuracy in your final answer.","--- Beginning of the template ---

1. **Determine the time spent on the beach:**
   Emma spends 66 minutes walking on the beach.

2. **Calculate the distance walked on the beach:**
   The distance Emma walks on the beach is 11 miles.

3. **Calculate her speed on the beach:**
   Speed is calculated as distance divided by time. Therefore, her speed on the beach is:
   \[
   \text{Speed on beach} = \frac{\text{Distance on beach}}{\text{Time on beach}} = \frac{11 \text{ miles}}{66 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{11}{66} \text{ miles per minute} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ miles per minute}

Next, we need to find out how fast she walks on the beach and then use that to find out how long it takes her to walk on the sidewalk.

4. To find her speed on the beach, we can calculate her speed using the distance and time:
   - Speed on the beach = Distance on the beach / Time on the beach
   - Speed on the beach = 11 miles / (66 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) = 11 miles / 1.1 hours = 10 miles per hour.

5. Since Emma walks at four times the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, her speed on the sidewalk is:
   - Speed on the sidewalk = 4 * Speed on the beach = 4 * 10 miles per hour = 40 miles per hour.

6. Now, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk the 16 miles on the sidewalk:
   - Time on the sidewalk = Distance on the sidewalk / Speed on the sidewalk
   - Time on the sidewalk = 16 miles / 40 miles per hour = 0.4 hours.

How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?",56.0,"To find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we first need to determine how many eggs were found by each person.

1. **Total eggs hidden**: Tariq hid 9 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we calculate:
   \[
   9 \text{ dozen} = 9 \times 12 = 108 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. **Noah's finds**: Noah finds 5 eggs.

3. **Emma's finds**: Emma finds four times as many as Noah. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Emma's finds} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ eggs}

2. **Calculate the number of apartments in the fourth complex.**
   The fourth complex is 35% bigger than the total of the first three complexes. First, we find 35% of the total apartments in the first three complexes:
   \[
   35\% \text{ of } 900 = 0.35 \times 900 = 315

How much would a 64-minute call cost?",24.0,"To calculate the total cost of a 64-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts based on the pricing structure:

1. The first 44 minutes at $0.5 per minute.
2. The remaining minutes (from 45 to 64) at $0.1 per minute.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost for the first 44 minutes.**

Cost for the first 44 minutes:
\[
\text{Cost} = 44 \text{ minutes} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/minute} = 22 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the remaining minutes.**

The total call duration is 64 minutes, so the remaining minutes after the first 44 minutes is:
\[
64 \text{ minutes} - 44 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost for the remaining 20 minutes.**

Cost for the remaining 20 minutes:
\[
\text{Cost} = 20 \text{ minutes} \times 0.1 \text{ dollars/minute} = 2 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the call.**

Now, we add the costs from both parts:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 22 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} = 24 \text{ dollars}

44 minutes * $0.5/minute = $22.  

After 44 minutes, the remaining time is:  
64 minutes - 44 minutes = 20 minutes.  
For these 20 minutes, the cost is $0.1 per minute.  
So, the cost for the remaining 20 minutes is:  
20 minutes * $0.1/minute = $2.  

Now, we add the costs together:  
Total cost = Cost for first 44 minutes + Cost for remaining 20 minutes

If they work 11 hours each day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?",50.0,"To find the percentage of the cleaner's day spent cleaning rooms, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time needed to clean all rooms:**
   - There are 110 rooms, and it takes 15 minutes to clean each room.

2. **Convert total cleaning time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we convert minutes to hours.

1. **Initial number of marbles**: Ali starts with 96 marbles.

2. **Marbles dropped**: He dropped three-sixths of the marbles.

4. **Final 22 seconds**: 
   - Popping slows down to half the rate of the previous 22 seconds (which was 120).
   - Number of kernels popped = \( \frac{120}{2} = 60\)

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels popped during the cooking process:

Alejandro is 16 years older than Daphne.  
So, Alejandro's age is 72 + 16 = 88 years old.  
Now, to find the average of their ages, we add their ages together and divide by 2.  
The total age is 72 + 88 = 160.  
Now, we divide by 2 to find the average: 160 / 2 = 80.  
The answer is 80.",80.0,1,0,1,80.0,,,

How many lemon cupcakes have they made?",4022.0,"To find out how many lemon cupcakes the Jones family has made, we can start by adding the number of strawberry and blueberry cupcakes together and then subtracting that total from the overall number of cupcakes.

1. **Add the number of strawberry and blueberry cupcakes:**
   \[
   1664 \text{ (strawberry)} + 1514 \text{ (blueberry)} = 3178
   \]

2. **Subtract the total of strawberry and blueberry cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes:**
   \[
   7200 \text{ (total cupcakes)} - 3178 \text{ (strawberry and blueberry)} = 4022
