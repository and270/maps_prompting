How much was the total cost if she received 25% discount on all purchases?",582.0,"To find the total cost of Beatriz's purchases, we will calculate the cost of each type of baked good, sum them up, and then apply the 25% discount.

1. **Calculate the cost of croissants:**
   - Beatriz bought 6 dozen croissants at $19 per dozen.
   \[
   \text{Cost of croissants} = 6 \text{ dozen} \times 19 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 114 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of macarons:**
   - Beatriz bought 4 dozen macarons at $77 per dozen.
   \[
   \text{Cost of macarons} = 4 \text{ dozen} \times 77 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 308 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of brownies:**
   - Beatriz bought 3 dozen brownies at $118 per dozen.
   \[
   \text{Cost of brownies} = 3 \text{ dozen} \times 118 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 354 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost before discount:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of croissants} + \text{Cost of macarons} + \text{Cost of brownies}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 114 + 308 + 354 = 776 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the discount:**
   - Beatriz received a 25% discount on the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 25\% \text{ of } 776 = 0.25 \times 776 = 194 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total cost after discount:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = 776 - 194 = 582 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total cost after applying the discount is **$582**.",582.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

[Example Input]
Question: I have 20 liters of lemonade that is one-fifth water and I want to mix it with 10 liters of orange juice that is one-third water. If I accidentally spill 5 liters of the lemonade, how much water is in the final mixture in liters?

Wrong answer: I calculated the total water in the lemonade as 4 liters (20 liters * 1/5) and the total water in the orange juice as 3.33 liters (10 liters * 1/3). I added these to get 7.33 liters of water, but I forgot to account for the spilled lemonade, so I said the final amount of water is still 7.33 liters.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total amount of lemonade after the spill and did not adjust the water content accordingly. I also failed to consider the impact of the spill on the total volume of the mixture.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Spillage
- Volume adjustment
- Percentage misunderstanding

Instructions:
1. Calculate the amount of water in the initial lemonade and orange juice separately.
2. Adjust the volume of lemonade after accounting for the spill.
3. Recalculate the amount of water in the remaining lemonade.
4. Add the water content from both drinks.
5. Calculate the total volume of the final mixture.
6. Determine the percentage of water in the final mixture.

Advice:
- Always double-check the impact of any spills or losses on the total volume.
- Keep track of the individual components in a mixture to avoid confusion.
- When calculating percentages, ensure you are using the correct total volume after any adjustments.

Solution:
The initial lemonade has 4 liters of water (20 liters * 1/5). The orange juice has 3.33 liters of water (10 liters * 1/3). After spilling 5 liters of lemonade, I have 15 liters left, which contains 3 liters of water (15 liters * 1/5). The total water is 3 liters (from lemonade) + 3.33 liters (from orange juice) = 6.33 liters. The total volume of the mixture is 15 liters (remaining lemonade) + 10 liters (orange juice) = 25 liters. Therefore, the percentage of water in the final mix is (6.33 liters / 25 liters) * 100 = 25.32%.

I miscalculated the total amount of water in the mango drink and the apple drink, and I also failed to properly account for the spillage and the addition of water. I did not correctly adjust the total volume of the mixture after the spill and the addition of water, which led to an incorrect percentage calculation.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Spillage
- Volume adjustment
- Percentage misunderstanding
- Incorrect addition

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the amount of water in the mango drink:**
   - Total volume of mango drink = 16 liters
   - Percentage of water in mango drink = 1/9
   - Water in mango drink = 16 liters * (1/9) = 16/9 ≈ 1.78 liters

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the apple drink:**
   - Total volume of apple drink = 14 liters
   - Percentage of water in apple drink = 1/2
   - Water in apple drink = 14 liters * (1/2) = 7 liters

3. **Adjust for the spillage of mango drink:**
   - Spilled mango drink = 7 liters
   - Remaining mango drink = 16 liters - 7 liters = 9 liters
   - Water in remaining mango drink = 9 liters * (1/9) = 1 liter

4. **Add the water to the mixture:**
   - Additional water added = 7 liters
   - Total water in the final mixture = Water from remaining mango drink + Water from apple drink + Additional water
   - Total water = 1 liter (from mango) + 7 liters (from apple) + 7 liters (added) = 15 liters

5. **Calculate the total volume of the final mixture:**
   - Total volume = Remaining mango drink + Apple drink + Added water
   - Total volume = 9 liters (remaining mango) + 14 liters (apple) + 7 liters (added) = 30 liters

6. **Calculate the percentage of water in the final mixture:**
   - Percentage of water = (Total water / Total volume) * 100
   - Percentage of water = (15 liters / 30 liters) * 100 = 50%

### Instructions:
1. Calculate the water content in each drink before any adjustments.
2. Adjust the volume of the drink after accounting for any spills.
3. Recalculate the water content in the remaining drink.
4. Add any additional water to the total water content.

p1,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Mei can run four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is 1/2 as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 10 hours if she spends 2/5 of the time running, 1/2 of the time skipping, and the remaining of the time walking?",27.0,"To solve the problem, we first need to determine Mei's walking, running, and skipping speeds based on the information provided.

1. **Determine Mei's skipping speed**:
   - It is given that Mei can skip at a speed of 2 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Mei's running speed**:
   - We know that she can skip at a rate that is 1/2 as fast as she can run. Therefore, if her skipping speed is 2 miles per hour, her running speed can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

3. **Determine Mei's walking speed**:
   - It is given that Mei can run four times faster than she can walk. Therefore, her walking speed can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

Now we have the following speeds:
- Walking speed: 1 mile per hour
- Running speed: 4 miles per hour
- Skipping speed: 2 miles per hour

4. **Determine the time spent on each activity**:
   - The total time is 10 hours.
   - Time spent running: \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 10 hours
   \[
   \text{Time running} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10 = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]
   - Time spent skipping: \( \frac{1}{2} \) of 10 hours
   \[
   \text{Time skipping} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]
   - Time spent walking: The remaining time is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Time walking} = 10 - \left(4 + 5\right) = 10 - 9 = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

5. **Calculate the distance traveled in each activity**:
   - Distance running:
   \[
   \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 4 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
   \]
   - Distance skipping:
   \[
   \text{Distance skipping} = \text{Skipping speed} \times \text{Time skipping} = 2 \text{ miles per hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ miles}
   \]
   - Distance walking:
   \[
   \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 1 \text{ mile}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled**:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance skipping} + \text{Distance walking} = 16 + 10 + 1 = 27 \text{ miles}
   \]

Thus, the total distance Mei can travel in 10 hours is \(\boxed{27}\) miles.",27.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine Mei's running speed**: 
   - We know that she can skip at 2 miles per hour.
   - Since she skips at a rate that is 1/2 as fast as she can run, we can find her running speed by doubling her skipping speed.
   - Running speed = 2 * 2 miles per hour = 4 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Mei's walking speed**: 
   - Mei can run four times faster than she can walk.
   - Therefore, her walking speed = Running speed / 4 = 4 miles per hour / 4 = 1 mile per hour.

3. **Calculate the total time spent running, skipping, and walking**:
   - The total time is 10 hours.
   - Time spent running = (2/5) of 10 hours = (2/5) * 10 = 4 hours.
   - Time spent skipping = (1/2) of 10 hours = (1/2) * 10 = 5 hours.
   - The remaining time for walking = Total time - (Time running + Time skipping) = 10 - (4 + 5) = 10 - 9 = 1 hour.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled in each activity**:
   - Distance running = Speed * Time = 4 miles per hour * 4 hours = 16 miles.
   - Distance skipping = Speed * Time = 2 miles per hour * 5 hours = 10 miles.
   - Distance walking = Speed * Time = 1 mile per hour * 1 hour = 1 mile.

5. **Calculate the total distance traveled**:
   - Total distance = Distance running + Distance skipping + Distance walking = 16 miles + 10 miles + 1 mile = 27 miles.

If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?",180.0,"To determine how many ounces of cookies you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume**:
   - Your daily calorie target is 2300 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1200 calories.
   - You have burned 100 calories through exercise.

   The effective calories consumed after exercise is:
   \[
   \text{Effective calories consumed} = 1200 - 100 = 1100 \text{ calories}
   \]

   Now, calculate the remaining calories:
   \[
   \text{Remaining calories} = 2300 - 1100 = 1200 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the calories per serving of cookies**:
   - Each serving of cookies has 200 calories.

3. **Calculate how many servings you can consume with the remaining calories**:
   \[
   \text{Number of servings} = \frac{\text{Remaining calories}}{\text{Calories per serving}} = \frac{1200}{200} = 6 \text{ servings}
   \]

4. **Find out how many ounces of cookies are in those servings**:
   - The bag contains 5 servings and has a total weight of 150 oz.
   - Therefore, each serving weighs:
   \[
   \text{Weight per serving} = \frac{150 \text{ oz}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 30 \text{ oz per serving}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total ounces you can eat**:
   \[
   \text{Total ounces} = \text{Number of servings} \times \text{Weight per serving} = 6 \times 30 = 180 \text{ oz}
   \]

However, since the bag only contains 150 oz, you cannot eat 180 oz. You can only eat the entire bag of cookies, which is 150 oz.

**Conclusion**: You can eat the entire 150 oz bag of cookies, but that would exceed your calorie target. You can only consume cookies up to your remaining calorie limit, which is 1200 calories, equating to 6 servings or 150 oz.",150.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many calories are left in the daily calorie target after consuming some calories and exercising.
   - Daily calorie target: 2300 calories
   - Calories already consumed: 1200 calories
   - Calories burned through exercise: 100 calories

   So, the remaining calories are:
   \[
   2300 - 1200 + 100 = 1200 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many calories are in one serving of cookies.
   - Each serving has 200 calories.

3. Now, we can calculate how many servings can be consumed with the remaining calories.
   - Remaining calories: 1200 calories
   - Calories per serving: 200 calories

   The number of servings that can be consumed is:
   \[
   \frac{1200}{200} = 6 \text{ servings}
   \]

4. Since we know that the bag has 5 servings, we need to check if we can consume the entire bag.
   - The bag contains 5 servings, which is:
   \[
   5 \text{ servings} \times 200 \text{ calories/serving} = 1000 \text{ calories}
   \]

5. Since 1000 calories is less than the 1200 calories we can still consume, we can eat the entire bag of cookies.

6. Now, we need to find out how many ounces are in the 5 servings.
   - The bag is 150 oz and contains 5 servings.

   Therefore, the amount of cookies per serving is:
   \[
   \frac{150 \text{ oz}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 30 \text{ oz/serving}
   \]

7. Finally, since we can eat the entire bag, the total amount of cookies we can eat is:
   \[
   150 \text{ oz}

[Example Input]
Question: A box of granola bars contains 250 calories per bar. If the box has 8 bars, how many bars can you eat if your daily calorie limit is 2000 and you have already consumed 800 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise?
Wrong answer: I calculated that I could eat 4 bars, but I forgot to account for the calories burned from exercise, which means I should have considered my effective calorie limit as 2200 instead of 2000.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the effective calorie limit by not including the calories burned from exercise, which led me to underestimate the number of bars I could consume.
Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Ignoring exercise calories
- Incorrect effective calorie limit
Instructions:
1. Determine your daily calorie target.
2. Subtract the calories already consumed from the daily target.
3. Add any calories burned through exercise to the remaining calorie allowance.
4. Calculate the total calories available for the food item based on its serving size.
5. Divide the total available calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings can be consumed.
Advice:
- Always account for calories burned through exercise when calculating your effective calorie limit.
- Double-check your calculations to ensure you are considering all relevant factors.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid missing important details.
Solution:
First, my daily calorie target is 2000. After consuming 800 calories and burning 200 calories, my effective calorie limit is 2000 - 800 + 200 = 1400 calories. Each granola bar has 250 calories, so I can eat 1400 / 250 = 5.6 bars. Since I can only eat whole bars, I can eat 5 bars.

Now, look at this question:
Question: According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has 200 calories per serving. If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2300 and you have already consumed 1200 calories and exercised for 100 calories?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 150.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question by misunderstanding the relationship between the total servings and the total volume of the bag. I mistakenly thought the entire bag could be consumed without properly calculating the effective calorie limit and the number of servings available based on the calorie intake and exercise.

### Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding serving size
- Incorrect calorie calculation
- Ignoring effective calorie limit

### Solution:
1. **Determine the daily calorie target**: My daily calorie target is 2300 calories.
2. **Calculate the effective calorie limit**: I have already consumed 1200 calories and burned 100 calories through exercise. Therefore, my effective calorie limit is:
   \[
   2300 - 1200 + 100 = 1200 \text{ calories}
   \]
3. **Identify calories per serving**: Each serving of cookies has 200 calories.
4. **Calculate the total servings I can consume**: To find out how many servings I can eat within my effective calorie limit:
   \[
   \text{Number of servings} = \frac{1200 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories/serving}} = 6 \text{ servings}
   \]
5. **Determine the total volume of the bag**: The bag contains 5 servings, and since it is 150 oz, the volume per serving is:
   \[
   \text{Volume per serving} = \frac{150 \text{ oz}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 30 \text{ oz/serving}
   \]
6. **Calculate the total ounces I can eat**: Since I can eat 6 servings, but the bag only contains 5 servings, I can only consume the total volume of the bag:
   \[
   \text{Total ounces I can eat} = 5 \text{ servings} \times 30 \text{ oz/serving} = 150 \text{ oz}
   \]
   However, since I can only eat up to my effective calorie limit, I will calculate the ounces based on the servings I can consume:
   \[
   \text{Ounces I can eat} = 5 \text{ servings} \times 30 \text{ oz/serving} = 150 \text{ oz}
   \]

### Final Answer:
I can eat 150 oz of cookies, but since I can only consume 5 servings, I will be limited to the entire bag, which is 150 oz.

### Instructions for Future Problems:
1. Identify the daily calorie target.
2. Subtract the calories already consumed from the daily target.
3. Add any calories burned through exercise to find the effective calorie limit.
4. Determine the calories per serving of the food item.
5. Calculate how many servings can be consumed within the effective calorie limit.
6. Check the total servings available in the bag and calculate the total volume based on servings.
7. Ensure that the total ounces consumed does not exceed the available servings in the bag.

### General Advice for Similar Problems:
- Always clarify the relationship between servings and total volume.
- Keep track of your effective calorie limit by considering both consumed calories and calories burned.
- Break down the problem into manageable steps to avoid confusion.
- Double-check calculations to ensure all factors are accounted for.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

Pavel usually sells tulips for ₺3.24 per basket, lilies for ₺3.57 per basket and orchids for ₺5.16 per basket. Pavel has no change today, so Pavel has decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. Pavel sells 19 baskets of tulips, 17 baskets of lilies and 35 baskets of orchids. How much will Pavel make, after receiving a 10% tip on every purchase?",330.0,"To find out how much Pavel will make after selling the flowers and receiving a 10% tip, we will follow these steps:

1. **Round the prices of the flowers to the nearest dollar.**
2. **Calculate the total sales from each type of flower.**
3. **Calculate the total sales including the tip.**

### Step 1: Round the Prices

- **Tulips:** ₺3.24 rounds to ₺3.
- **Lilies:** ₺3.57 rounds to ₺4.
- **Orchids:** ₺5.16 rounds to ₺5.

### Step 2: Calculate Total Sales

Now we will calculate the total sales for each type of flower:

- **Tulips:** 
  \[
  19 \text{ baskets} \times ₺3 = ₺57
  \]

- **Lilies:** 
  \[
  17 \text{ baskets} \times ₺4 = ₺68
  \]

- **Orchids:** 
  \[
  35 \text{ baskets} \times ₺5 = ₺175
  \]

Now, we will sum these amounts to find the total sales:

\[
\text{Total Sales} = ₺57 + ₺68 + ₺175 = ₺300
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Sales Including the Tip

Pavel receives a 10% tip on his total sales. We will calculate the tip and then add it to the total sales:

- **Tip:**
  \[
  \text{Tip} = 10\% \text{ of } ₺300 = 0.10 \times ₺300 = ₺30
  \]

- **Total Amount Received:**
  \[
  \text{Total Amount} = \text{Total Sales} + \text{Tip} = ₺300 + ₺30 = ₺330
  \]

### Final Answer

Pavel will make a total of **₺330** after receiving a 10% tip on every purchase.",10.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the rounded prices for each type of flower:**
   - Tulips: ₺3.24 rounds to ₺3.00.
   - Lilies: ₺3.57 rounds to ₺4.00.
   - Orchids: ₺5.16 rounds to ₺5.00.

2. **Calculate the total sales for each type of flower:**
   - For tulips: 
     - Price per basket = ₺3.00
     - Number of baskets = 19
     - Total from tulips = 19 * 3.00 = ₺57.00.
   
   - For lilies:

   - For orchids:
     - Price per basket = ₺5.00
     - Number of baskets = 35
     - Total from orchids = 35 * 5.00 = ₺175.00.

3. **Calculate the total sales from all flowers:**
   - Total sales = Total from tulips + Total from lilies + Total from orchids
   - Total sales = ₺57.00 + ₺68.00 + ₺175.00 = ₺300.00.

4. **Calculate the tip amount:**
   - Tip percentage = 10%
   - Tip amount = 10% of total sales = 0.10 * 300.00 = ₺30.00.

5. **Calculate the total amount Pavel will make after receiving the tip:**

p1,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Kayla is an avid gardener. Last week, she received 43 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 12 potted plants on each of the 65 window ledges of her large country home. She also purchased 140 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 4 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Kayla remain with?",703.0,"To find out how many potted plants Kayla will have after giving some away, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of potted plants she currently has:**
   - She received 43 new potted plants.
   - She has 12 potted plants on each of the 65 window ledges.

   First, calculate the total number of potted plants on the window ledges:
   \[
   12 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 65 \text{ ledges} = 780 \text{ plants}
   \]

   Now, add the new plants she received:
   \[
   780 \text{ plants} + 43 \text{ new plants} = 823 \text{ plants}
   \]

2. **Add the new plants she purchased:**
   - She purchased 140 new plants.

   So, the total number of potted plants now is:
   \[
   823 \text{ plants} + 140 \text{ plants} = 963 \text{ plants}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of plants she will give away:**
   - She plans to give away 4 potted plants from each of the 65 ledges.

   Calculate the total number of plants given away:
   \[
   4 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 65 \text{ ledges} = 260 \text{ plants}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining number of potted plants:**
   - Subtract the number of plants given away from the total number of plants she has:
   \[
   963 \text{ plants} - 260 \text{ plants} = 703 \text{ plants}
   \]

Thus, after giving away the plants, Kayla will remain with **703 potted plants**.",703.0,1,"A: Let's think step by step.

1. Kayla received 43 new potted plants from the nursery.
2. She already has 12 potted plants on each of the 65 window ledges.
   - To find the total number of potted plants she has from the ledges, we calculate:
     \( 12 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 65 \text{ ledges} = 780 \text{ plants} \).
3. Now, we add the new plants she received to the plants she already has:
   - Total plants after receiving new ones:
     \( 780 + 43 = 823 \text{ plants} \).
4. She purchased 140 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount. However, the discount does not affect the total number of plants she has, so we simply add these to her total:
   - Total plants after the purchase:
     \( 823 + 140 = 963 \text{ plants} \).
5. Kayla plans to give away 4 potted plants from each ledge. Since she has 65 ledges, the total number of plants she will give away is:
   - Total plants given away:
     \( 4 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 65 \text{ ledges} = 260 \text{ plants} \).
6. Finally, we subtract the number of plants she gives away from her total:
   - Remaining plants:
     \( 963 - 260 = 703 \text{ plants} \).

Next, we know that the fog bank takes 41 minutes to cover every 3 miles. We can calculate how many 3-mile segments are in 6 miles:

\[
\text{Number of 3-mile segments in 6 miles} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 2 \text{ segments}

Next, we know that it takes 41 minutes to cover every 3 miles. 

Now, we need to determine how many 3-mile segments are in 6 miles:
6 miles / 3 miles per segment = 2 segments.

Since it takes 41 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, we multiply the number of segments by the time it takes to cover one segment:
2 segments * 41 minutes per segment = 82 minutes.

On Wednesday, he got to stay up late, so he watched two 5-hour episodes. On Thursday, he watched four episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 24 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?",5.0,"To find out how many 15-minute episodes Noah watched on Monday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he spent watching TV from Saturday to Thursday, and then determine how much time was left for Monday.

1. **Saturday and Sunday:**
   - He watched 4 hours each night for 2 nights.
   - Total time for Saturday and Sunday:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Monday:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of 15-minute episodes he watched on Monday.
   - The total time for these episodes in hours is:
     \[
     \frac{x \times 15 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{x}{4} \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Tuesday:**
   - He watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show.
   - Total time for Tuesday:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} + 0.75 \text{ hours} = 3.75 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Wednesday:**
   - He watched two 5-hour episodes.
   - Total time for Wednesday:
     \[
     5 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Thursday:**
   - He watched four 15-minute episodes.
   - Total time for Thursday:
     \[
     4 \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} = 1 \text{ hour}
     \]

Now, we can sum the total hours watched from Saturday to Thursday:

\[
\text{Total time from Saturday to Thursday} = 8 \text{ hours} + \frac{x}{4} \text{ hours} + 3.75 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour}
\]

Combining these, we have:

\[
8 + 3.75 + 10 + 1 = 22.75 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time equation becomes:

\[
22.75 + \frac{x}{4} = 24
\]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract 22.75 from both sides:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 24 - 22.75
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 1.25
   \]

2. Multiply both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = 1.25 \times 4
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

Therefore, Noah watched **5 episodes** of the 15-minute show on Monday.",15.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total TV time for Saturday and Sunday:**
   - On Saturday, he watched 4 hours.
   - On Sunday, he watched 4 hours.
   - Total for Saturday and Sunday = 4 + 4 = 8 hours.

2. **Convert hours to minutes for easier calculations:**
   - 8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

3. **Calculate the TV time for Tuesday:**
   - On Tuesday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show.
   - 3 hours = 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.
   - Total for Tuesday = 180 + 45 = 225 minutes.

4. **Calculate the TV time for Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, he watched two 5-hour episodes.
   - 5 hours = 5 * 60 = 300 minutes.
   - Total for Wednesday = 2 * 300 = 600 minutes.

5. **Calculate the TV time for Thursday:**
   - On Thursday, he watched four 15-minute episodes.
   - Total for Thursday = 4 * 15 = 60 minutes.

6. **Now, add up all the minutes watched from Saturday to Thursday:**
   - Total minutes = 480 (Saturday and Sunday) + 225 (Tuesday) + 600 (Wednesday) + 60 (Thursday).
   - Total minutes = 480 + 225 + 600 + 60 = 1365 minutes.

7. **Convert the total TV time watched into hours:**
   - 24 hours = 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes.

8. **Calculate the minutes watched on Monday:**
   - Total minutes watched = 1440 minutes.
   - Minutes watched on Monday = Total minutes - (Total minutes from Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday).
   - Minutes watched on Monday = 1440 - 1365 = 75 minutes.

9. **Determine how many 15-minute episodes he watched on Monday:**

If she used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.",504.0,"To solve the problem, we need to break down the information given and set up equations based on the ratios provided.

1. **Understanding the Ratios**:
   - The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 63:14.
   - The ratio of tablespoons of milk to cups of water is 9:7.

2. **Let’s define variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of cups of water used.
   - From the ratio of sugar to water, the amount of sugar used can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{sugar} = \frac{63}{14} \cdot x = \frac{63x}{14} = 4.5x
     \]
   - From the ratio of milk to water, the amount of milk used can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{milk} = \frac{9}{7} \cdot x
     \]

3. **Total Ingredients**:
   - The total amount of ingredients used is given as 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk:
     \[
     \text{sugar} + \text{water} + \text{milk} = 760
     \]
   - Substituting the expressions for sugar and milk:
     \[
     4.5x + x + \frac{9}{7}x = 760
     \]

4. **Combining Terms**:
   - First, combine the terms involving \( x \):
     \[
     4.5x + x = 5.5x
     \]
   - Now, we need to combine \( 5.5x \) and \( \frac{9}{7}x \):
     - To combine these, we can convert \( 5.5 \) to a fraction:
       \[
       5.5 = \frac{11}{2}
       \]
     - Now, we need a common denominator to add \( \frac{11}{2}x \) and \( \frac{9}{7}x \). The least common multiple of 2 and 7 is 14.
     - Convert both fractions:
       \[
       \frac{11}{2} = \frac{77}{14}, \quad \frac{9}{7} = \frac{18}{14}
       \]
     - Now we can add them:
       \[
       \frac{77}{14}x + \frac{18}{14}x = \frac{95}{14}x
       \]

5. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - Now we have:
     \[
     \frac{95}{14}x = 760
     \]

6. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - Multiply both sides by 14 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     95x = 760 \times 14
     \]
   - Calculate \( 760 \times 14 \):
     \[
     760 \times 14 = 10640
     \]
   - Now divide by 95:
     \[
     x = \frac{10640}{95} = 112
     \]

7. **Calculating the Amount of Sugar**:
   - Now that we have \( x = 112 \) (the number of cups of water), we can find the amount of sugar:
     \[
     \text{sugar} = 4.5x = 4.5 \times 112 = 504
     \]

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Fatima used is \( \boxed{504} \).",504.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Understanding the ratios**: 
   - The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 63:14.
   - The ratio of tablespoons of milk to cups of water is 9:7.

2. **Finding the total parts in the sugar and water ratio**:
   - The total parts in the sugar and water ratio is 63 (sugar) + 14 (water) = 77 parts.

3. **Finding the total parts in the milk and water ratio**:
   - The total parts in the milk and water ratio is 9 (milk) + 7 (water) = 16 parts.

4. **Finding the total parts for all ingredients**:
   - The total parts for sugar, water, and milk combined is 77 (from sugar and water) + 16 (from milk and water) - 14 (since cups of water are counted in both ratios) = 79 parts.

5. **Finding the value of each part**:
   - We know that the total amount of ingredients used is 760 teaspoons (which includes sugar, water, and milk).
   - Therefore, each part is equal to 760 / 79 = approximately 9.62 teaspoons.

6. **Calculating the amount of sugar**:
   - Since the ratio of sugar is 63 parts, the total amount of sugar used is 63 * 9.62 = approximately 605.06 teaspoons.

7. **Rounding to the nearest whole number**:
   - Since we cannot have a fraction of a teaspoon in this context, we round 605.06 to 605 teaspoons.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the amount of sugar by not properly considering the total ratio of all ingredients involved. I mistakenly focused only on the sugar and water ratio without accounting for the milk, which also contributes to the total. This led to an incorrect distribution of the total amount.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Ratio misunderstanding
- Incorrect total consideration
- Oversight of additional ingredients

### Solution:
1. **Identify the ratios**: The ratio of sugar to water is 63:14, and for milk to water, it is 9:7.
2. **Calculate the total parts for sugar and water**: 
   - Sugar + Water = 63 + 14 = 77 parts.
3. **Calculate the total parts for milk and water**: 
   - Milk + Water = 9 + 7 = 16 parts.
4. **Combine the ratios**: 
   - To combine these ratios, we need to express them in terms of a common unit. Since water is common in both ratios, we can express the total parts as follows:
   - For every 14 cups of water, there are 63 teaspoons of sugar and 9 tablespoons of milk. 
   - To find a common ratio, we can scale the water in the first ratio to match the second. 
   - If we take 14 cups of water from the first ratio, we can find how many tablespoons of milk correspond to that amount:
     - 14 cups of water corresponds to (14 cups / 7 cups) * 9 tablespoons = 18 tablespoons of milk.
5. **Total parts**: 
   - Now we have:
     - Sugar: 63 parts
     - Water: 14 parts
     - Milk: 18 parts
   - Total parts = 63 + 14 + 18 = 95 parts.
6. **Calculate the value of one part**: 
   - Total amount = 760 teaspoons (this includes sugar, water, and milk).
   - Value of one part = 760 / 95 = 8 teaspoons.
7. **Calculate the amount of sugar**: 
   - Amount of sugar = 63 parts × 8 teaspoons/part = 504 teaspoons.

### Instructions:
1. Identify all the ingredients and their respective ratios.
2. Calculate the total parts for each ratio.
3. Find a common unit for any overlapping ingredients (like water).
4. Combine the ratios into a single total parts count.
5. Divide the total amount by the total parts to find the value of one part.
6. Multiply the value of one part by the number of parts for the ingredient in question.
7. Double-check calculations for accuracy.

### Advice:
- Always account for all ingredients involved in the problem.
- Ensure that ratios are combined correctly, especially when there are overlapping ingredients.
- Practice problems with multiple ingredients to become more comfortable with complex ratios.
- Double-check each step to avoid missing any components of the problem.","--- Beginning of the template ---

p1,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Rania was preparing for a baby shower at her house, where she intended to serve shrimp scampi. She noticed that she was out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new package of spoons. Later, her husband also bought a package of 17 new spoons and gave them to Rania. While Rania was making the shrimp scampi, she used eleven of the spoons to sample her shrimp scampi. The guests also brought 3 packs of spoons, each having 13 inside them. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 86 spoons. How many spoons were in the package that Rania bought?",41.0,"Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Rania bought as \( x \).

1. Rania bought \( x \) spoons.
2. Her husband bought 17 spoons.
3. The guests brought 3 packs of spoons, each containing 13 spoons. Therefore, the total number of spoons brought by the guests is:
   \[
   3 \times 13 = 39 \text{ spoons}
   \]

Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of spoons before Rania used any:

\[
\text{Total spoons} = x + 17 + 39
\]

Next, Rania used 11 spoons for sampling the shrimp scampi. Therefore, the total number of spoons left after she used 11 is:

\[
\text{Total spoons left} = (x + 17 + 39) - 11

How many oranges can Jin harvest in 2 years?,9680.0,"To find out how many oranges Jin can harvest in 2 years, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total area of the orange field**: Jin has 55 square meters of orange field.

2. **Determine the number of oranges per square meter**: Since there are 44 oranges per one-half square meter, we can find the number of oranges per square meter by doubling that amount:
   \[
   \text{Oranges per square meter} = 44 \text{ oranges} \times 2 = 88 \text{ oranges}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of oranges in the field**: Now, we can find the total number of oranges in the entire field by multiplying the number of oranges per square meter by the total area:
   \[
   \text{Total oranges} = 88 \text{ oranges/square meter} \times 55 \text{ square meters} = 4840 \text{ oranges}

Jin has 55 square meters of orange field.  
There are 44 oranges per one-half square meter.  

First, we need to find out how many half-square meters are in 55 square meters:  
55 square meters = 55 / 0.5 = 110 half-square meters.  

Next, we calculate the total number of oranges in the entire field:  
Total oranges = 110 half-square meters * 44 oranges per half-square meter = 4840 oranges.  

Jin can harvest his oranges every 12 months, which means he can harvest once a year.  
In 2 years, he will have 2 harvests.  

So, the total number of oranges Jin can harvest in 2 years is:

On average, how many LinkedIn friends do Fatima, Noah, and Jasmine have?",54.0,"Let's denote the number of LinkedIn friends Noah has as \( N \).

According to the problem, we know the following:

1. Fatima has six times as many LinkedIn friends as Noah:
   \[
   F = 6N

2. Jasmine has two times as many friends on LinkedIn as Noah:
   \[
   J = 2N
   \]
3. Fatima has 108 friends on LinkedIn:
   \[
   F = 108

Now, we can set up the equation using the information about Fatima:
\[
6N = 108
\]

To find \( N \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[
N = \frac{108}{6} = 18

Now we have:
- Fatima's friends: \( F = 108 \)
- Noah's friends: \( N = 18 \)
- Jasmine's friends: \( J = 36 \)

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row?,43.75,"To solve the problem, we need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 on a 20-sided die, and the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 10:**
   - The numbers on a 20-sided die are 1 through 20.
   - The numbers greater than 10 are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. 
   - There are 10 numbers greater than 10.
   - The total number of outcomes when rolling the die is 20.
   - Therefore, the probability \( P(\text{greater than 10}) \) is:
     \[
     P(\text{greater than 10}) = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]

2. **Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row:**
   - The odd numbers on a 20-sided die are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19. 
   - There are 10 odd numbers.
   - The probability of rolling an odd number on one roll is:
     \[
     P(\text{odd}) = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]
   - The probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row is the product of the probabilities of rolling an odd number on each of the four rolls:
     \[
     P(\text{four odd numbers}) = P(\text{odd})^4 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16}

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - We have:
     - \( P(\text{greater than 10}) = 0.5 \)
     - \( P(\text{four odd numbers}) = \frac{1}{16} = 0.0625 \)

4. **Calculating how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 10:**
   - We need to find the difference in probabilities:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = P(\text{greater than 10}) - P(\text{four odd numbers}) = 0.5 - 0.0625 = 0.4375

5. **Expressing the difference as a percentage:**
   - To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     \text{Percentage difference} = 0.4375 \times 100 = 43.75\%

### Solution:
1. **Identify the total number of animals:**
   - Rabbits: 64
   - Grasshoppers: 36
   - Ants: 24

   Total animals = Rabbits + Grasshoppers + Ants
   Total animals = 64 + 36 + 24 = 124

2. **Calculate the percentage of rabbits:**
   - Number of rabbits = 64
   - Total number of animals = 124

   Percentage of rabbits = (Number of rabbits / Total number of animals) * 100
   Percentage of rabbits = (64 / 124) * 100

3. **Perform the calculation:**
   - Percentage of rabbits = (64 / 124) * 100 ≈ 51.61%

   However, I need to ensure this is correct. Let's calculate it again:
   - 64 divided by 124 = 0.5161 (approximately)
   - 0.5161 * 100 = 51.61%

   This confirms my previous calculation was correct, but I need to ensure I understand the context of the question better.

### Instructions:
1. List all the types of animals present in the plot.
2. Write down the number of each type of animal.
3. Calculate the total number of animals by adding all the counts together.
4. Use the formula for percentage: (part/whole) * 100 to find the percentage of the specific type of animal (in this case, rabbits).
5. Double-check each step to ensure accuracy in calculations.

### Advice:
- Always verify the total count of all items before calculating percentages.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion and ensure clarity.
- Review the calculations step-by-step to catch any potential errors before finalizing the answer.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

p1,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Yuki was a pen pal with 8 people. He stopped being penpals with 4 of them. They each send 3 letters a week that are 10 pages long. He responds in kind. He can write a page every 14 minutes. On average, how many hours does Yuki spend writing in a day?",4.0,"To find out how many hours Yuki spends writing in a day, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Yuki is still in contact with:**
   - Yuki originally had 8 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 4 of them.
   - Therefore, the number of pen pals he still has is:
     \[
     8 - 4 = 4
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of letters sent per week:**
   - Each of the 4 pen pals sends 3 letters a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of letters sent per week is:
     \[
     4 \text{ pen pals} \times 3 \text{ letters/pen pal} = 12 \text{ letters/week}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pages Yuki receives per week:**
   - Each letter is 10 pages long.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages Yuki receives per week is:
     \[
     12 \text{ letters/week} \times 10 \text{ pages/letter} = 120 \text{ pages/week}
     \]

4. **Determine the total number of pages Yuki writes in response:**
   - Yuki responds in kind, so he also writes 120 pages per week.

5. **Calculate the time Yuki spends writing these pages:**
   - Yuki can write 1 page in 14 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time in minutes he spends writing 120 pages is:
     \[
     120 \text{ pages} \times 14 \text{ minutes/page} = 1680 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

6. **Convert the total writing time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
     \[
     \frac{1680 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 28 \text{ hours/week}
     \]

7. **Calculate the average time spent writing per day:**
   - There are 7 days in a week, so the average time spent writing per day is:
     \[
     \frac{28 \text{ hours/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ hours/day}
     \]

Thus, Yuki spends an average of **4 hours** writing in a day.",4.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Yuki was a pen pal with 8 people.
2. He stopped being pen pals with 4 of them.
3. So, the number of pen pals he has now is 8 - 4 = 4.
4. Each of these 4 pen pals sends 3 letters a week.
5. Therefore, the total number of letters Yuki receives in a week is 4 * 3 = 12 letters.
6. Each letter is 10 pages long.
7. So, the total number of pages Yuki receives in a week is 12 * 10 = 120 pages.
8. Yuki responds to each page he receives, so he also writes 120 pages in a week.
9. Yuki can write a page every 14 minutes.
10. The total time Yuki spends writing 120 pages is 120 pages * 14 minutes/page = 1680 minutes.
11. To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60: 1680 minutes / 60 = 28 hours.
12. Since this is the total time spent in a week, we need to find the average time spent in a day. There are 7 days in a week.
13. So, the average time spent writing in a day is 28 hours / 7 days = 4 hours.

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 4% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 13% of the selling price. If Ms. Johnson can get 10% discount on the selling price, how much more is the total cost will be than Ms. Johnson's budget?",56500.0,"To determine how much more the total cost will be than Ms. Johnson's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the property after applying the discount and adding the brokerage and transfer fees.

1. **Calculate the discount on the selling price:**
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = 500,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 10\% \text{ of Selling Price} = 0.10 \times 500,000 = 50,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Discount} = 500,000 - 50,000 = 450,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 4\% \text{ of Selling Price} = 0.04 \times 500,000 = 20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 13\% \text{ of Selling Price} = 0.13 \times 500,000 = 65,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Discounted Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 450,000 + 20,000 + 65,000 = 535,000

5. **Determine how much more the total cost is than Ms. Johnson's budget:**
   \[
   \text{Budget} = 470,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Budget} = 535,000 - 470,000 = 65,000
   \]

Thus, the total cost will be **$65,000** more than Ms. Johnson's budget.",65000.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Selling Price of the Property**: The selling price is $500,000.

2. **Discount on Selling Price**: Ms. Johnson can get a 10% discount on the selling price.
   - Discount amount = 10% of $500,000 = 0.10 * $500,000 = $50,000.
   - Selling price after discount = $500,000 - $50,000 = $450,000.

3. **Brokerage Fee**: The brokerage fee is 4% of the selling price.
   - Brokerage fee = 4% of $500,000 = 0.04 * $500,000 = $20,000.

4. **Transfer Fee**: The transfer fee is 13% of the selling price.
   - Transfer fee = 13% of $500,000 = 0.13 * $500,000 = $65,000.

5. **Total Cost**: Now, we need to calculate the total cost including the selling price after discount, brokerage fee, and transfer fee.
   - Total cost = Selling price after discount + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
   - Total cost = $450,000 + $20,000 + $65,000 = $535,000.

6. **Ms. Johnson's Budget**: Ms. Johnson's budget is $470,000.

7. **Difference from Budget**: Now, we find out how much more the total cost is than Ms. Johnson's budget.
   - Difference = Total cost - Budget
   - Difference = $535,000 - $470,000 = $65,000.

[Example Input]
Question: Sarah wants to buy a car that costs $25,000. She has a budget of $22,000. The dealership offers her a 5% discount on the car price, but she also needs to pay a sales tax of 8% on the final price after the discount. How much over her budget will Sarah go if she buys the car?

Wrong answer: I calculated the discount as $1,250, making the price $23,750. Then, I calculated the sales tax as $1,900, leading to a total cost of $25,650. I concluded that Sarah would go over her budget by $3,650. However, I miscalculated the sales tax.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the sales tax by applying it to the original price instead of the discounted price. I should have calculated the sales tax on $23,750 instead of $25,000.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect application of tax
- Discount misunderstanding

Instructions:
1. Determine the discount amount by multiplying the original price by the discount percentage.
2. Subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price.
3. Calculate the sales tax based on the discounted price.
4. Add the sales tax to the discounted price to find the total cost.
5. Compare the total cost to the budget to determine how much over the budget it is.

Advice:
- Always double-check calculations, especially when applying percentages.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid confusion.
- Keep track of the order of operations when dealing with multiple financial factors.

Solution:
1. Discount: $25,000 * 0.05 = $1,250
2. Discounted price: $25,000 - $1,250 = $23,750
3. Sales tax: $23,750 * 0.08 = $1,900
4. Total cost: $23,750 + $1,900 = $25,650
5. Over budget: $25,650 - $22,000 = $3,650

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the total cost by not properly accounting for the discount before applying the brokerage and transfer fees. I mistakenly added the fees to the original selling price instead of the discounted price, leading to an inflated total cost.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect application of fees
- Discount misunderstanding

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the discount amount**:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 500,000 \times 0.10 = 50,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the discounted selling price**:
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = 500,000 - 50,000 = 450,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the brokerage fee (4% of the selling price)**:
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 500,000 \times 0.04 = 20,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the transfer fee (13% of the selling price)**:
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 500,000 \times 0.13 = 65,000
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost**:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Discounted Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 450,000 + 20,000 + 65,000 = 535,000
   \]

6. **Determine how much over budget Ms. Johnson will go**:
   \[
   \text{Over Budget} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Budget}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Over Budget} = 535,000 - 470,000 = 65,000
   \]

### Final Answer:
Ms. Johnson will go over her budget by **$65,000**.

### Instructions for Future Problems:
1. Identify the original selling price and the budget.
2. Calculate any applicable discounts first.
3. Determine the discounted price after applying the discount.
4. Calculate any additional fees (brokerage, transfer, etc.) based on the original selling price, not the discounted price.
5. Add the discounted price and all fees to find the total cost.
6. Compare the total cost to the budget to find out how much over the budget it is.

### General Advice for Similar Problems:
- Always apply discounts before calculating additional fees.
- Clearly distinguish between the original price and the discounted price when calculating costs.
- Break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps to avoid confusion.
- Double-check calculations, especially when multiple percentages are involved.","--- Beginning of the template ---

I answered the question incorrectly because I miscalculated the total cost by not properly accounting for the discount before applying the brokerage and transfer fees. I also failed to correctly sum the total costs after applying the fees to the discounted price.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation of fees
- Incorrect application of discount
- Budget comparison error

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the discount on the selling price:**
   - Selling price = $500,000
   - Discount = 10% of $500,000 = $50,000

2. **Calculate the discounted price:**
   - Discounted price = $500,000 - $50,000 = $450,000

3. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   - Brokerage fee = 4% of $500,000 = $20,000

4. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   - Transfer fee = 13% of $500,000 = $65,000

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Discounted price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
   - Total cost = $450,000 + $20,000 + $65,000 = $535,000

If he also paid $260000 for the remaining loan amount of the apartment, and $5000 for closing costs, how much is Prof. Johnson's net proceeds from selling the apartment?",226400.0,"To calculate Prof. Johnson's net proceeds from selling the apartment, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the registration fees**:
   \[
   \text{Registration Fees} = 3\% \text{ of } 540000 = 0.03 \times 540000 = 16200
   \]

2. **Calculate the agent fee**:
   \[
   \text{Agent Fee} = 6\% \text{ of } 540000 = 0.06 \times 540000 = 32400
   \]

3. **Calculate the total costs**:
   - Remaining loan amount: $260,000
   - Closing costs: $5,000
   - Total costs = Registration Fees + Agent Fee + Remaining Loan + Closing Costs
   \[
   \text{Total Costs} = 16200 + 32400 + 260000 + 5000 = 303600
   \]

4. **Calculate the net proceeds**:
   \[
   \text{Net Proceeds} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Total Costs}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Net Proceeds} = 540000 - 303600 = 236400
   \]

Thus, Prof. Johnson's net proceeds from selling the apartment are **$236,400**.",236400.0,0,"A: Let's think step by step.

1. Prof. Johnson sold his apartment for $540,000.
2. He paid registration fees of 3% of the selling price:
   - Registration fees = 3% of $540,000 = 0.03 * 540,000 = $16,200.
3. He also paid an agent fee of 6% of the selling price:
   - Agent fee = 6% of $540,000 = 0.06 * 540,000 = $32,400.
4. He paid $260,000 for the remaining loan amount of the apartment.
5. He also paid $5,000 for closing costs.

Now, let's calculate the total costs:
- Total costs = Registration fees + Agent fee + Remaining loan amount + Closing costs
- Total costs = $16,200 + $32,400 + $260,000 + $5,000 = $313,600.

Next, we calculate the net proceeds from selling the apartment:
- Net proceeds = Selling price - Total costs

How much money did Mateo make after tax in September if the company performed very well for the whole month?",1703.0,"To calculate Mateo's earnings after tax for the month of September, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Mateo's weekly earnings before tax.**
   - Mateo works 6 hours a day for 3 days a week.
   - His hourly wage is ₣25.
   - Weekly hours worked = 6 hours/day * 3 days/week = 18 hours/week.
   - Weekly earnings from hours worked = 18 hours/week * ₣25/hour = ₣450/week.

2. **Add the weekly bonus.**

Thus, Mateo made **₣1,703** after tax in September.",1703.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate Mateo's weekly earnings from hours worked:**
   - Mateo works 6 hours each day.
   - He works 3 days a week.
   - So, the total hours worked in a week is \(6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 18 \text{ hours/week}\).

2. **Calculate Mateo's earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - Mateo earns ₣25 per hour.
   - Therefore, his earnings from hours worked in a week is \(18 \text{ hours/week} \times ₣25/\text{hour} = ₣450\).

3. **Add the weekly bonus:**
   - Mateo receives a ₣205 bonus each week.

The roller coaster costs €10 per ride. For the transportation of the birthday party guests, Emma needs to rent a bus for the day, which costs €60. How many friends can she invite?",2.0,"To determine how many friends Emma can invite to her birthday party, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and then see how many friends can be accommodated within her budget of €180.

1. **Calculate the cost of one round of laser tag for Emma and her friends:**
   - Cost of one round of laser tag: €6
   - Let \( n \) be the number of friends Emma invites. Therefore, the total number of participants (Emma + friends) is \( n + 1 \).
   - Total cost for laser tag: \( 6(n + 1) \)

2. **Calculate the cost of pinball tokens for Emma and her friends:**
   - Cost of pinball tokens per person: €4
   - Total cost for pinball tokens: \( 4(n + 1) \)

   \text{Total Pineapples} = 200 + 69 = 269
   \]

5. **Pineapples and Kiwis After Further Purchases**:
   Theo then bought 13 more pineapples. So, the total number of pineapples now is:
   \[
   \text{Total Pineapples} = 269 + 13 = 282
   \]

   Next, he bought 22 fewer than two times the number of kiwis. First, we calculate two times the number of kiwis:
   \[
   2 \times \text{New Kiwis} = 2 \times 88 = 176
   \]
   Now, subtracting 22 gives:
   \[
   \text{Kiwis Bought} = 176 - 22 = 154
   \]
   Adding this to the current count of kiwis:
   \[
   \text{Total Kiwis} = 88 + 154 = 242
   \]

6. **Final Count of Kiwis and Pineapples**:
   Now we have:
   - Total Kiwis = 242
   - Total Pineapples = 282

7. **Combined Total**:
   Finally, we find the total number of fruits (kiwis and pineapples combined):
   \[
   \text{Total Fruits} = \text{Total Kiwis} + \text{Total Pineapples} = 242 + 282 = 524
   \]

Thus, the total number of pineapples and kiwis Theo has in the house combined is \( \boxed{524} \).",524.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Initial Count of Kiwis**: Theo has a total of 25 kiwis.

2. **Count of Pineapples**: Since there are eight times as many pineapples as kiwis, we calculate the number of pineapples:
   \[
   \text{Number of pineapples} = 8 \times \text{Number of kiwis} = 8 \times 25 = 200
   \]

3. **Kiwis After Purchase**: Theo bought 63 more kiwis:
   \[
   \text{Total kiwis after purchase} = 25 + 63 = 88
   \]

4. **Pineapples After Purchase**: Theo bought 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis he now has:
   \[
   \text{Pineapples bought} = 88 - 19 = 69
   \]
   Now, we add this to the initial count of pineapples:
   \[
   \text{Total pineapples after purchase} = 200 + 69 = 269
   \]

5. **Pineapples from the Next Purchase**: Theo later bought 13 more pineapples:
   \[
   \text{Total pineapples after next purchase} = 269 + 13 = 282
   \]

6. **Kiwis for the Next Purchase**: He bought 22 fewer than two times as many kiwis:
   \[
   \text{Two times the number of kiwis} = 2 \times 88 = 176
   \]
   So, the number of kiwis he bought is:
   \[
   \text{Kiwis bought} = 176 - 22 = 154
   \]
   Now, we add this to the total count of kiwis:
   \[
   \text{Total kiwis after next purchase} = 88 + 154 = 242
   \]

7. **Total Count of Pineapples and Kiwis**: Finally, we find the total number of pineapples and kiwis combined:
   \[
   \text{Total} = \text{Total pineapples} + \text{Total kiwis} = 282 + 242 = 524
   \]

[Example Input]
Question: At a fruit market, there are three times as many apples as oranges. If there are 15 oranges, and the market receives 30 more oranges and 10 fewer apples than the number of oranges, how many apples and oranges are there in total at the market?
Wrong answer: I calculated that there are 45 apples and 15 oranges, but I forgot to account for the additional oranges and the correct number of apples after the purchase.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total number of apples by not properly adjusting for the number of apples after the market received more oranges and fewer apples than the number of oranges.
Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect adjustment
- Oversight in operations
Instructions:
1. Identify the initial quantities of each fruit based on the ratios given.
2. Calculate the total number of oranges after the market receives more.
3. Adjust the number of apples based on the new number of oranges.
4. Sum the final quantities of apples and oranges to find the total.
Advice:
- Carefully track changes in quantities when additional items are added or removed.
- Double-check calculations at each step to ensure accuracy.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion.
Solution:
Initially, there are 15 oranges, so there are 3 * 15 = 45 apples. After receiving 30 more oranges, there are 15 + 30 = 45 oranges. The market has 10 fewer apples than the new number of oranges, so there are 45 - 10 = 35 apples. The total number of fruits is 35 + 45 = 80.

I miscalculated the total number of pineapples and kiwis by not properly tracking the changes in quantities after each transaction. I failed to account for the adjustments made to both the kiwis and pineapples correctly, leading to an incorrect total.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect adjustment
- Oversight in operations
- Failure to track changes

### Solution:
1. **Initial Quantities**:
   - Theo has 25 kiwis.
   - Since there are eight times as many pineapples as kiwis, the number of pineapples is \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \).

2. **After Buying More Kiwis**:
   - Theo buys 63 more kiwis: 
     \[
     25 + 63 = 88 \text{ kiwis}
     \]

3. **Adjusting Pineapples**:
   - Theo has 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis:
     \[
     88 - 19 = 69 \text{ pineapples}
     \]

4. **After Buying More Pineapples**:
   - Theo buys 13 more pineapples:
     \[
     69 + 13 = 82 \text{ pineapples}
     \]

5. **Final Adjustment for Pineapples**:
   - Theo buys 22 fewer than two times the number of kiwis:
     \[
     2 \times 88 = 176
     \]
     \[
     176 - 22 = 154 \text{ pineapples}
     \]

6. **Final Count of Pineapples**:
   - The total number of pineapples after the last purchase is:
     \[
     82 + 154 = 236 \text{ pineapples}
     \]

7. **Total Fruits**:
   - Finally, the total number of fruits (kiwis + pineapples) is:

### Solution:
1. **Initial Quantities**:
   - Theo has 25 kiwis.
   - Since there are eight times as many pineapples as kiwis, the number of pineapples is \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \).

2. **After Buying More Kiwis**:
   - Theo buys 63 more kiwis: 
     \[
     25 + 63 = 88 \text{ kiwis}
     \]

3. **Adjusting Pineapples**:
   - Theo has 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis:
     \[
     88 - 19 = 69 \text{ pineapples}
     \]

4. **After Buying More Pineapples**:
   - Theo buys 13 more pineapples:
     \[
     69 + 13 = 82 \text{ pineapples}
     \]

5. **Final Adjustment for Pineapples**:
   - Theo buys 22 fewer than two times the number of kiwis:
     \[
     2 \times 88 = 176
     \]
     \[
     176 - 22 = 154 \text{ pineapples}
     \]

6. **Total Pineapples**:
   - The total number of pineapples after all adjustments is:
     \[
     82 + 154 = 236 \text{ pineapples}
     \]

7. **Final Total**:
   - The total number of fruits (kiwis + pineapples) is:

At the gift shop, saltwater taffy was on sale for ""Buy 16 kgs at $23 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/2 off."" She scooped up 23 kgs. She also bought a mixed bag of starfish for $11.0 and 17 keychains that were $20.0 each. Ananya then donated $5 at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Ananya have left?",361.0,"Let's break down Ananya's purchases step by step.

1. **Cost of Saltwater Taffy:**
   - She buys 16 kgs at $23 per kg:
     \[
     16 \text{ kgs} \times 23 \text{ dollars/kg} = 368 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - She gets 4 kgs at half price. The price per kg is $23, so half price is:
     \[
     \frac{23}{2} = 11.5 \text{ dollars/kg}
     \]
   - The cost for 4 kgs at half price:
     \[
     4 \text{ kgs} \times 11.5 \text{ dollars/kg} = 46 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total cost for the saltwater taffy:
     \[
     368 \text{ dollars} + 46 \text{ dollars} = 414 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of the Mixed Bag of Starfish:**
   - The cost is $11.0.

3. **Cost of Keychains:**
   - She buys 17 keychains at $20.0 each:
     \[
     17 \text{ keychains} \times 20 \text{ dollars/keychain} = 340 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total Cost of All Purchases:**
   - Now, we add up all the costs:
     \[
     414 \text{ dollars (taffy)} + 11 \text{ dollars (starfish)} + 340 \text{ dollars (keychains)} = 765 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Donation:**
   - Ananya donates $5:
     \[
     765 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 770 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Total Amount Spent:**
   - Total amount spent is $770.

7. **Amount Left:**
   - Ananya started with $1200, so the amount left is:
     \[
     1200 \text{ dollars} - 770 \text{ dollars} = 430 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Ananya has **$430** left.",430.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Ananya starts with $1200.
2. She buys 23 kgs of saltwater taffy. The price is structured as follows:
   - For the first 16 kgs, the cost is 16 kgs * $23/kg = $368.
   - For the next 4 kgs, she gets them at half price. The price for 4 kgs at half price is:
     - Regular price for 4 kgs = 4 kgs * $23/kg = $92.
     - Half price = $92 / 2 = $46.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 20 kgs (16 kgs + 4 kgs) is $368 + $46 = $414.
   - For the remaining 3 kgs, the cost is 3 kgs * $23/kg = $69.
   - So, the total cost for 23 kgs of saltwater taffy is $414 + $69 = $483.

3. Next, Ananya buys a mixed bag of starfish for $11.0.

4. Then, she buys 17 keychains at $20.0 each. The total cost for the keychains is:
   - 17 keychains * $20.0/keychain = $340.

5. Now, let's calculate the total amount spent:
   - Total spent on taffy = $483.
   - Total spent on starfish = $11.0.
   - Total spent on keychains = $340.
   - Total spent = $483 + $11.0 + $340 = $834.

6. Ananya also donates $5 at a charity stand.

7. Now, let's calculate the total amount spent including the donation:
   - Total spent including donation = $834 + $5 = $839.

8. Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount Ananya had:
   - Amount left = $1200 - $839 = $361.

How many giants each person have slew on average?",480.0,"To find the average number of giants each person slew, we first need to determine how many giants each person slew individually.

1. **Theo's Giants:**
   \[
   \text{Theo} = 450
   \]

2. **Jamal's Giants:**
   Jamal slew three-fifths as many giants as Theo:
   \[
   \text{Jamal} = \frac{3}{5} \times 450 = 270

Now we have the number of giants each person slew:
- Theo: 450
- Jamal: 270
- Luis: 1080
- Oscar: 120

Next, we calculate the total number of giants slain by all four:
\[

2. **Calculate how many giants Luis slew:**
   - Luis slew four times as many giants as Jamal.
   - So, Luis's count is \( 4 \times 270 = 1080 \) giants.

3. **Calculate how many giants Oscar slew:**
   - Oscar slew 1/9 as many giants as Luis.
   - So, Oscar's count is \( \frac{1}{9} \times 1080 = 120 \) giants.

4. **Calculate the total number of giants slain by all four:**
   - Total = Theo's giants + Jamal's giants + Luis's giants + Oscar's giants
   - Total = \( 450 + 270 + 1080 + 120 = 1920 \) giants.

5. **Calculate the average number of giants slain:**
   - There are 4 people (Theo, Jamal, Luis, and Oscar).

Andre spent $100 and got 4 bags of crackers, 7 packs of pretzels, and had 3% of his money left in change. How many gum did he buy?",45.0,"To find out how many packs of gum Andre bought, we can start by calculating how much money he spent on the items he purchased.

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Andre had initially:**
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 100 \text{ dollars} = 10000 \text{ cents}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of money he had left after spending:**
   Since he had 3% of his money left in change:
   \[
   \text{Change left} = 0.03 \times 10000 \text{ cents} = 300 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount he spent:**
   \[
   \text{Total spent} = \text{Total money} - \text{Change left} = 10000 \text{ cents} - 300 \text{ cents} = 9700 \text{ cents}

4. **Calculate the cost of the items he bought:**
   - Cost of crackers: 4 bags at 75 cents each
     \[
     \text{Cost of crackers} = 4 \times 75 = 300 \text{ cents}
     \]
   - Cost of pretzels: 7 packs at 700 cents each (since $7 = 700 cents)

Thus, Andre bought **45 packs of gum**.",45.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, we need to calculate how much money Andre spent on the items he bought.
2. The cost of 4 bags of crackers is:
   - 4 bags * 75 cents = 300 cents.
3. The cost of 7 packs of pretzels is:
   - 7 packs * 700 cents (since $7 = 700 cents) = 4900 cents.
4. Now, let's add the total cost of the crackers and pretzels:
   - Total cost = 300 cents + 4900 cents = 5200 cents.
5. Andre started with $100, which is:

6. He had 3% of his money left in change. Let's calculate how much that is:
   - 3% of 10000 cents = 0.03 * 10000 = 300 cents.
7. Now, we can find out how much he actually spent:
   - Amount spent = Total money - Change left = 10000 cents - 300 cents = 9700 cents.
8. Now, we can find out how much he spent on gum:
   - Amount spent on gum = Total spent - Amount spent on crackers and pretzels = 9700 cents - 5200 cents = 4500 cents.
9. The cost of one pack of gum is 100 cents, so the number of packs of gum he bought is:

p1,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"The area of Kai's rectangular office is 225 square feet. If the length of his room is 16 feet longer that its width, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?",68.0,"To find the perimeter of Kai's rectangular office, we first need to determine the dimensions of the room: its width and length.

Let the width of the room be denoted as \( w \) feet. According to the problem, the length \( l \) of the room is 16 feet longer than the width. Therefore, we can express the length as:

\[
l = w + 16
\]

The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[
A = l \times w
\]

We know that the area of Kai's office is 225 square feet, so we can set up the equation:

\[
w \times (w + 16) = 225
\]

Expanding this equation gives:

\[
w^2 + 16w = 225
\]

To solve for \( w \), we rearrange the equation:

\[
w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0
\]

Next, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for \( w \). The quadratic formula is:

\[
w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

In our equation, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 16 \), and \( c = -225 \). Plugging in these values:

\[
w = \frac{-16 \pm \sqrt{16^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-225)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]

Calculating the discriminant:

\[
16^2 = 256
\]
\[
-4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-225) = 900
\]
\[
b^2 - 4ac = 256 + 900 = 1156
\]

Now, taking the square root:

\[
\sqrt{1156} = 34
\]

Now substituting back into the quadratic formula:

\[
w = \frac{-16 \pm 34}{2}
\]

Calculating the two possible values for \( w \):

1. \( w = \frac{-16 + 34}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
2. \( w = \frac{-16 - 34}{2} = \frac{-50}{2} = -25 \) (not a valid solution since width cannot be negative)

Thus, the width \( w \) is 9 feet. Now we can find the length \( l \):

\[
l = w + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25 \text{ feet}
\]

Now that we have both dimensions, we can calculate the perimeter \( P \) of the rectangle using the formula:

\[
P = 2(l + w)
\]

Substituting the values of \( l \) and \( w \):

\[
P = 2(25 + 9) = 2(34) = 68 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, the perimeter of Kai's office is:

\[
\boxed{68} \text{ feet}
\]",68.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. We know the area of the rectangular office is 225 square feet.
2. Let the width of the room be \( w \) feet. Then, the length of the room is \( w + 16 \) feet (since the length is 16 feet longer than the width).
3. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
   \[
   \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   225 = (w + 16) \times w
   \]
4. Expanding the equation:
   \[
   225 = w^2 + 16w
   \]
5. Rearranging the equation to set it to zero:
   \[
   w^2 + 16w - 225 = 0
   \]
6. Now, we can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
   \[
   w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 16 \), and \( c = -225 \).
7. Calculating the discriminant:
   \[
   b^2 - 4ac = 16^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-225) = 256 + 900 = 1156
   \]
8. Now, substituting back into the quadratic formula:
   \[
   w = \frac{-16 \pm \sqrt{1156}}{2 \times 1}
   \]
   \[
   w = \frac{-16 \pm 34}{2}
   \]
9. This gives us two possible solutions for \( w \):
   \[
   w = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \quad \text{(valid, since width cannot be negative)}
   \]
   \[
   w = \frac{-50}{2} = -25 \quad \text{(not valid)}
   \]
10. So, the width \( w \) is 9 feet. Now, we can find the length:
    \[
    \text{Length} = w + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25 \text{ feet}
    \]
11. Now, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:
    \[
    \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) = 2 \times (25 + 9)
    \]
12. Calculating the perimeter:
    \[
    \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 34 = 68 \text{ feet}

How many trips does the farmer need to transport all the items, if he has three trucks?",5.0,"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the items, we first need to calculate the total weight of the items he is buying.

1. **Calculate the weight of each item:**
   - **Corn:** 4 boxes of 5 kg each
     \[
     4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ kg}
     \]
   - **Carrots:** 11 bags of 9 kg each
     \[
     11 \times 9 = 99 \text{ kg}
     \]
   - **Apples:** 33 packs of 43 kg each
     \[
     33 \times 43 = 1419 \text{ kg}
     \]
   - **Wheat:** 18 sacks of 19 kg each
     \[
     18 \times 19 = 342 \text{ kg}
     \]
   - **Grocery:** 43 kg
   - **Tools:** 27 kg

2. **Sum the total weight:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 20 + 99 + 1419 + 342 + 43 + 27
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 20 + 99 = 119
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 119 + 1419 = 1538
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 1538 + 342 = 1880
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 1880 + 43 = 1923
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 1923 + 27 = 1950
   \]

3. **Determine the capacity of the trucks:**
   Each truck can carry 130 kg. Since the farmer has 3 trucks, the total capacity of all trucks combined is:
   \[
   3 \times 130 = 390 \text{ kg}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of trips needed:**
   To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the total capacity of the trucks:
   \[
   \text{Number of trips} = \frac{1950}{390}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of trips} = 5
   \]

Thus, the farmer needs **5 trips** to transport all the items.",5.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total weight of each type of feed:**
   - Corns: 4 boxes * 5 kg/box = 20 kg
   - Carrots: 11 bags * 9 kg/bag = 99 kg
   - Apples: 33 packs * 43 kg/pack = 1419 kg
   - Wheat: 18 sacks * 19 kg/sack = 342 kg
   - Grocery: 43 kg
   - Tools: 27 kg

2. **Add up all the weights to find the total weight:**
   - Total weight = Corns + Carrots + Apples + Wheat + Grocery + Tools
   - Total weight = 20 kg + 99 kg + 1419 kg + 342 kg + 43 kg + 27 kg
   - Total weight = 20 + 99 + 1419 + 342 + 43 + 27 = 1950 kg

3. **Determine how much weight one truck can carry:**
   - Each truck can carry 130 kg.

4. **Calculate the number of trips needed for one truck:**
   - Number of trips for one truck = Total weight / Weight per truck
   - Number of trips for one truck = 1950 kg / 130 kg = 15 trips (since 1950 ÷ 130 = 15 with a remainder, we round up to the next whole number).

5. **Since the farmer has three trucks, divide the number of trips by 3:**
   - Number of trips needed with three trucks = 15 trips / 3 trucks = 5 trips.

After using all her sprinkles to bake cupcakes and putting them in pans, how many empty pans will Leilani be left with?",1.0,"To determine how many empty pans Leilani will have after baking cupcakes with her sprinkles, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cupcakes Leilani can decorate with her sprinkles:**
   - Leilani has 4 jars of sprinkles.
   - Each jar can decorate 16 cupcakes.
   - Therefore, the total number of cupcakes she can decorate is:
     \[
     4 \text{ jars} \times 16 \text{ cupcakes/jar} = 64 \text{ cupcakes}

1. **Calculate the total number of remoras that go away.**
   - There are 15 remoras in total.
   - \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the remoras go away:
     \[
     \text{Number of remoras that go away} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of remaining remoras.**
   - Remaining remoras:
     \[
     \text{Remaining remoras} = 15 - 3 = 12
     \]

3. **Calculate the total length of the remaining remoras.**
   - Each remora is 15 inches long.
   - Total length of the remaining remoras:
     \[
     \text{Total length of remaining remoras} = 12 \times 15 = 180 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Convert the shark's length from feet to inches.**
   - The shark is 75 feet long.
   - Since there are 12 inches in a foot:
     \[
     \text{Shark's length in inches} = 75 \times 12 = 900 \text{ inches}
     \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that is the combined length of the remaining remoras.**
   - The percentage is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total length of remaining remoras}}{\text{Shark's length}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{180}{900} \right) \times 100

   - Simplifying:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\%

Thus, the combined length of the remaining remoras is **20%** of the shark's body length.",20.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Ali saw a shark that is 75 feet long.
2. There are 15 remoras, each measuring 15 inches.
3. First, we need to find the total length of the remoras. Since there are 15 remoras, the total length is:
   \[
   15 \text{ remoras} \times 15 \text{ inches/remora} = 225 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. Next, we need to convert the shark's length from feet to inches because the remoras' length is in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
   \[
   75 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 900 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. Now, we need to determine how many remoras go away. Since \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the remoras leave, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \text{ remoras}
   \]

6. Therefore, the number of remaining remoras is:
   \[
   15 - 3 = 12 \text{ remoras}
   \]

7. Now, we calculate the combined length of the remaining remoras:
   \[
   12 \text{ remoras} \times 15 \text{ inches/remora} = 180 \text{ inches}
   \]

8. To find out what percentage of the shark's body length this combined length of the remaining remoras represents, we use the formula for percentage:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remaining remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{180 \text{ inches}}{900 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100

She wants to make a poncho, hat, beanie, booties, and gloves for each of them. It takes 18 skeins of wool to make a poncho, 17 for a hat, 15 for a beanie, 8 for a pair of booties, and 16 for a pair of gloves. Emma wants to make two warm jackets for herself, each needing 11 skeins of wool. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?",318.0,"To find out how many skeins of wool Emma needs to buy, we will first calculate the total amount of wool required for the items she is making for her grandchildren and then add the amount needed for her jackets.

1. **Calculate the total wool needed for one grandchild:**
   - Poncho: 18 skeins
   - Hat: 17 skeins
   - Beanie: 15 skeins
   - Booties: 8 skeins
   - Gloves: 16 skeins

   Now, we sum these amounts:
   \[
   18 + 17 + 15 + 8 + 16 = 74 \text{ skeins}

She writes it in full five times, writes three-sixths of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. After some rest, again she re-writes everything she has written so far. How many letters has Kayla written in total?",572.0,"To find out how many letters Kayla has written in total, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Writing the alphabet five times:**
   The English alphabet has 26 letters. If Kayla writes the alphabet five times, the total number of letters written is:
   \[
   5 \times 26 = 130
   \]

2. **Writing three-sixths of the alphabet once:**
   Three-sixths of the alphabet is equivalent to half of the alphabet. Therefore, the number of letters in three-sixths of the alphabet is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{6} \times 26 = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13

3. **Re-writing everything she has already written:**
   At this point, Kayla has written a total of:
   \[
   130 + 13 = 143

5. **Rest and re-writing everything again:**
   After some rest, she rewrites everything she has written so far again. So, she writes another 286 letters.

6. **Final total:**

When the water is warm, Carlos swims a kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times as long. How much longer does Carlos take to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day than 9 kilometers on a cold day?",272.0,"To solve the problem, we first need to determine how long it takes Carlos to swim in both cold and warm water.

1. **Cold Water Swim Time:**
   - Carlos swims 1 kilometer in 11 minutes.
   - Therefore, for 9 kilometers in cold water:
     \[
     \text{Time for 9 km in cold water} = 9 \text{ km} \times 11 \text{ minutes/km} = 99 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Warm Water Swim Time:**
   - Carlos swims 1 kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times the time it takes in cold water.
   - First, we calculate four times the cold water time:
     \[
     4 \times 11 \text{ minutes} = 44 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Now, adding 9 minutes:
     \[
     \text{Time for 1 km in warm water} = 44 \text{ minutes} + 9 \text{ minutes} = 53 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Therefore, for 7 kilometers in warm water:
     \[
     \text{Time for 7 km in warm water} = 7 \text{ km} \times 53 \text{ minutes/km} = 371 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculating the Difference:**
   - Now we need to find out how much longer it takes Carlos to swim 7 kilometers in warm water compared to 9 kilometers in cold water:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Time for 7 km in warm water} - \text{Time for 9 km in cold water}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 371 \text{ minutes} - 99 \text{ minutes} = 272 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, Carlos takes **272 minutes longer** to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day than he does to swim 9 kilometers on a cold day.",9.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Cold Water Swim Time**: Carlos swims 1 kilometer in 11 minutes when the water is cold. 
   - For 9 kilometers in cold water, the time taken is:
   \[
   9 \text{ km} \times 11 \text{ minutes/km} = 99 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Warm Water Swim Time**: When the water is warm, Carlos swims a kilometer in 9 minutes more than four times the cold water time.
   - First, calculate four times the cold water time:
   \[
   4 \times 11 \text{ minutes} = 44 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   - Now, add 9 minutes to this:
   \[
   44 \text{ minutes} + 9 \text{ minutes} = 53 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   - So, in warm water, Carlos swims 1 kilometer in 53 minutes.

3. **Time for 7 Kilometers in Warm Water**: Now, calculate the time taken to swim 7 kilometers in warm water:
   \[
   7 \text{ km} \times 53 \text{ minutes/km} = 371 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Difference in Time**: Finally, we need to find out how much longer Carlos takes to swim 7 kilometers on a warm day than 9 kilometers on a cold day:
   - The time taken in warm water for 7 kilometers is 371 minutes.
   - The time taken in cold water for 9 kilometers is 99 minutes.
   - The difference is:

What is the total weekly production for the three if they work all days of the week?",840.0,"To solve the problem, we first need to establish the speeds of Nadia, Emma, and Uma in terms of customers processed per day.

1. **Emma's Speed**: 
   - Emma processes 8 customers per day.

2. **Nadia's Speed**: 
   - Nadia operates 9 times as fast as Emma. Therefore, her speed is:
   \[
   \text{Nadia's speed} = 9 \times \text{Emma's speed} = 9 \times 8 = 72 \text{ customers per day}

3. **Uma's Speed**: 
   - Uma operates at the average speed of Emma and Nadia. We first calculate the average speed:
   \[
   \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Emma's speed} + \text{Nadia's speed}}{2} = \frac{8 + 72}{2} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ customers per day}

3. **Determine Nadia's speed**: Nadia operates nine times as fast as Emma. Therefore, her daily production is:
   \[
   8 \text{ customers/day} \times 9 = 72 \text{ customers/day}
   \]

4. **Calculate Nadia's weekly production**: Nadia's total weekly production is:
   \[
   72 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 504 \text{ customers}

5. **Calculate Uma's speed**: Uma operates at the average speed of Emma and Nadia. First, we find the average:
   \[
   \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Emma's speed} + \text{Nadia's speed}}{2} = \frac{8 + 72}{2} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ customers/day}

6. **Calculate Uma's weekly production**: Uma's total weekly production is:
   \[
   40 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ customers}

On average, how many pages does she have left to write per day?",11.0,"To find out how many pages Olga has left to write per day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pages Olga has already written**:
   Since she has completed \( \frac{3}{4} \) of her 176-page thesis, we can calculate the number of pages she has written as follows:
   \[
   \text{Pages written} = \frac{3}{4} \times 176
   \]
   \[
   \text{Pages written} = \frac{3 \times 176}{4} = \frac{528}{4} = 132
   \]

2. **Determine the number of pages left to write**:
   To find out how many pages she has left to write, we subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages:
   \[
   \text{Pages left} = 176 - 132 = 44
   \]

3. **Calculate the average number of pages she needs to write per day**:
   Olga has 4 days left to complete her thesis. We can find the average number of pages she needs to write each day by dividing the number of pages left by the number of days remaining:
   \[
   \text{Pages per day} = \frac{\text{Pages left}}{\text{Days left}} = \frac{44}{4} = 11

He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 40% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of flour and he uses 3 kilograms of flour per day. He also decided to buy himself a bagel for ₣4. Since he shopped more than ₣50, he received a ₣23 discount. How much does Santiago have to pay?",275.0,"To find out how much Santiago has to pay, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive flour:**
   - The normal brand costs ₣10 per kilogram.
   - The more expensive brand costs 40% more than the normal brand.
   - To find the cost of the more expensive brand:
     \[
     \text{Cost of more expensive flour} = \text{Normal cost} + (0.40 \times \text{Normal cost}) = 10 + (0.40 \times 10) = 10 + 4 = ₣14 \text{ per kilogram}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of flour Santiago needs for a week:**
   - Santiago uses 3 kilograms of flour per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he needs:
     \[
     \text{Total flour needed} = 3 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ kg}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the flour:**
   - The total cost for 21 kilograms of the more expensive flour is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of flour} = 21 \text{ kg} \times ₣14/\text{kg} = ₣294

4. **Add the cost of the bagel:**
   - The cost of the bagel is ₣4.
   - Therefore, the total cost before any discounts is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost before discount} = ₣294 + ₣4 = ₣298

   - Santiago receives a discount of ₣23 because his total shopping was more than ₣50.
   - The total cost after the discount is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost after discount} = ₣298 - ₣23 = ₣275

     \[
     0.40 \times 10 = 4
     \]
   - Now, we add this to the normal price:
     \[
     10 + 4 = 14

Each cow eats as much as a goat and alpaca eat combined. If there are 21 goats, 7 alpacas, and 21 cows, how many kilograms of grain does Alejandro need?",798.0,"To find out how many kilograms of grain Alejandro needs, we will first determine the amount of grain required for each type of livestock: goats, alpacas, and cows.

1. **Calculate the grain needed for the goats:**
   Each goat needs 9 kilograms of grain. 
   There are 21 goats, so the total grain needed for the goats is:
   \[
   \text{Grain for goats} = 21 \text{ goats} \times 9 \text{ kg/goat} = 189 \text{ kg}
   \]

2. **Calculate the grain needed for the alpacas:**
   Each alpaca needs 3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs. 
   First, we calculate twice the amount each goat needs:
   \[
   2 \times 9 \text{ kg} = 18 \text{ kg}
   \]
   Now, subtract 3 kilograms:
   \[
   18 \text{ kg} - 3 \text{ kg} = 15 \text{ kg}
   \]
   Each alpaca needs 15 kilograms of grain. 
   There are 7 alpacas, so the total grain needed for the alpacas is:
   \[
   \text{Grain for alpacas} = 7 \text{ alpacas} \times 15 \text{ kg/alpaca} = 105 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. **Calculate the grain needed for the cows:**
   Each cow eats as much as a goat and an alpaca eat combined. 
   We already know that a goat eats 9 kilograms and an alpaca eats 15 kilograms. 
   Therefore, the total grain needed for one cow is:
   \[
   \text{Grain for one cow} = 9 \text{ kg} + 15 \text{ kg} = 24 \text{ kg}
   \]
   There are 21 cows, so the total grain needed for the cows is:
   \[
   \text{Grain for cows} = 21 \text{ cows} \times 24 \text{ kg/cow} = 504 \text{ kg}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total grain needed:**
   Now, we sum the grain needed for all types of livestock:
   \[
   \text{Total grain} = \text{Grain for goats} + \text{Grain for alpacas} + \text{Grain for cows}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total grain} = 189 \text{ kg} + 105 \text{ kg} + 504 \text{ kg} = 798 \text{ kg}
   \]

Thus, Alejandro needs a total of **798 kilograms** of grain.",798.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of grain needed for each goat:**
   Each goat needs 9 kilograms of grain.

2. **Calculate the amount of grain needed for each alpaca:**
   Each alpaca needs 3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs: 2 * 9 = 18 kilograms.
   - Therefore, each alpaca needs: 18 - 3 = 15 kilograms.

3. **Calculate the amount of grain needed for each cow:**
   Each cow eats as much as a goat and an alpaca eat combined.
   - The amount a goat eats: 9 kilograms.
   - The amount an alpaca eats: 15 kilograms.
   - Therefore, each cow needs: 9 + 15 = 24 kilograms.

4. **Calculate the total amount of grain needed for all goats:**
   There are 21 goats.
   - Total for goats: 21 * 9 = 189 kilograms.

5. **Calculate the total amount of grain needed for all alpacas:**
   There are 7 alpacas.
   - Total for alpacas: 7 * 15 = 105 kilograms.

6. **Calculate the total amount of grain needed for all cows:**
   There are 21 cows.
   - Total for cows: 21 * 24 = 504 kilograms.

7. **Calculate the total amount of grain needed for all livestock:**
   - Total grain needed = Total for goats + Total for alpacas + Total for cows

Due to the flu season, 35 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.",50.0,"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of occupied beds**:
   The hospital has a total of 800 beds, and \( \frac{1}{8} \) of them are occupied.
   \[
   \text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{8} \times 800 = 100 \text{ beds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of beds out of service**:
   One-fifth of all the beds are out of service.
   \[
   \text{Out of service beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 800 = 160 \text{ beds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of beds that are either occupied or out of service**:
   \[
   \text{Total occupied or out of service} = \text{Occupied beds} + \text{Out of service beds} = 100 + 160 = 260 \text{ beds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of unoccupied beds**:
   The total number of unoccupied beds is the total number of beds minus the number of occupied and out of service beds.
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied beds} = 800 - 260 = 540 \text{ beds}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks**:
   There are 35 patients admitted each day. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted is:
   \[
   \text{Total patients admitted} = 35 \times 14 = 490 \text{ patients}
   \]

6. **Calculate the new number of occupied beds after 2 weeks**:
   After 2 weeks, the number of occupied beds will increase by the number of patients admitted.
   \[
   \text{New occupied beds} = \text{Initial occupied beds} + \text{Total patients admitted} = 100 + 490 = 590 \text{ beds}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks**:
   Now we need to find the new number of unoccupied beds:
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 800 - \text{New occupied beds} - \text{Out of service beds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 800 - 590 - 160 = 50 \text{ beds}
   \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is \( \boxed{50} \).",50.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. The hospital has a total capacity of 800 beds.
2. First, we need to find out how many beds are occupied. Since 1/8 of the beds are occupied:
   \[
   \text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{8} \times 800 = 100 \text{ beds}
   \]

3. Next, we find out how many beds are out of service. One-fifth of all the beds are out of service:
   \[
   \text{Out of service beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 800 = 160 \text{ beds}
   \]

4. Now, we can calculate the total number of beds that are either occupied or out of service:
   \[
   \text{Total occupied and out of service beds} = 100 + 160 = 260 \text{ beds}
   \]

5. To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total occupied and out of service beds from the total capacity:
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied beds} = 800 - 260 = 540 \text{ beds}
   \]

6. Now, we need to account for the 35 patients admitted each day for 2 weeks (14 days):
   \[
   \text{Total patients admitted} = 35 \times 14 = 490 \text{ patients}
   \]

7. Finally, we subtract the total patients admitted from the unoccupied beds to find the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 540 - 490 = 50 \text{ beds}

On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday and 28 boxes of orange pie. On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the cupcake cost ₺10 and the orange pie cost ₺22, how much was Andre's average daily earning?",980.0,"To find Andre's average daily earning, we first need to determine how many boxes of cupcakes and orange pies he sold each day.

### Step 1: Determine the number of boxes sold on Monday
- **Cupcakes sold on Monday**: 24 boxes
- **Orange pies sold on Monday**: Since he sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pies than on Tuesday, we need to find out how many he sold on Tuesday first.

### Step 2: Determine the number of boxes sold on Tuesday
- **Cupcakes sold on Tuesday**: He sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday.
  \[
  \text{Cupcakes on Tuesday} = 24 + 11 = 35 \text{ boxes}
  \]
- **Orange pies sold on Tuesday**: He sold 28 boxes of orange pies.

### Step 3: Determine the number of boxes sold on Monday for orange pies
Since he sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pies on Monday than on Tuesday:
\[
\text{Orange pies on Monday} = 28 - 16 = 12 \text{ boxes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total boxes sold on Wednesday
On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined (Monday and Tuesday).
- **Total boxes sold on Monday**:
  \[
  \text{Total on Monday} = \text{Cupcakes} + \text{Orange pies} = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ boxes}
  \]
- **Total boxes sold on Tuesday**:
  \[
  \text{Total on Tuesday} = \text{Cupcakes} + \text{Orange pies} = 35 + 28 = 63 \text{ boxes}
  \]
- **Total boxes sold in the past two days**:
  \[
  \text{Total for Monday and Tuesday} = 36 + 63 = 99 \text{ boxes}
  \]
- Therefore, on Wednesday, he sold 99 boxes.

### Step 5: Calculate the earnings for each day
- **Earnings on Monday**:
  - Cupcakes: \(24 \times 10 = 240\)
  - Orange pies: \(12 \times 22 = 264\)
  - Total earnings on Monday: 
  \[
  240 + 264 = 504 \text{ ₺}
  \]

- **Earnings on Tuesday**:
  - Cupcakes: \(35 \times 10 = 350\)
  - Orange pies: \(28 \times 22 = 616\)
  - Total earnings on Tuesday: 
  \[
  350 + 616 = 966 \text{ ₺}
  \]

- **Earnings on Wednesday**:
  - Total boxes sold: 99 (as calculated)
  - To find the number of cupcakes and orange pies sold on Wednesday, we need to assume a distribution. However, since we only need total earnings, we can calculate it based on the average price of the items sold.
  
  Let's assume he sold the same ratio of cupcakes to orange pies as he did on Tuesday:
  - Ratio of cupcakes to orange pies on Tuesday:
  \[
  \text{Ratio} = \frac{35}{28} = \frac{5}{4}
  \]
  - Total parts = 5 + 4 = 9 parts.
  - Total boxes sold on Wednesday = 99 boxes.
  - Cupcakes sold on Wednesday:
  \[
  \text{Cupcakes} = \frac{5}{9} \times 99 \approx 55 \text{ boxes}
  \]
  - Orange pies sold on Wednesday:
  \[
  \text{Orange pies} = \frac{4}{9} \times 99 \approx 44 \text{ boxes}
  \]
  
  - Earnings on Wednesday:
  \[
  \text{Cupcakes} = 55 \times 10 = 550 \text{ ₺}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Orange pies} = 44 \times 22 = 968 \text{ ₺}
  \]
  - Total earnings on Wednesday:
  \[
  550 + 968 = 1518 \text{ ₺}
  \]

### Step 6: Calculate the average daily earnings
Now we can calculate the average daily earnings over the three days:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 504 + 966 + 1518 = 2988 \text{ ₺}
\]
\[
\text{Average daily earnings} = \frac{2988}{3} = 996 \text{ ₺}
\]

Thus, Andre's average daily earning is **₺996**.",996.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Sales on Monday:**
   - Andre sold 24 boxes of cupcakes.
   - He sold 16 fewer boxes of orange pies than on Tuesday. 

2. **Sales on Tuesday:**
   - On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday.
   - So, the number of boxes of cupcakes sold on Tuesday is:
     \[
     24 + 11 = 35
     \]
   - He sold 28 boxes of orange pies on Tuesday.

3. **Sales on Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined.
   - First, we need to calculate the total sales from Monday and Tuesday:
     - Total boxes sold on Monday:
       - Cupcakes: 24
       - Orange pies: (since he sold 16 fewer than Tuesday, we need to find Tuesday's orange pies first)
       - On Tuesday, he sold 28 orange pies, so on Monday he sold:
         \[
         28 - 16 = 12
         \]
       - Total on Monday = 24 (cupcakes) + 12 (orange pies) = 36 boxes.
     - Total boxes sold on Tuesday:
       - Cupcakes: 35
       - Orange pies: 28
       - Total on Tuesday = 35 + 28 = 63 boxes.
     - Combined total for Monday and Tuesday:
       \[
       36 + 63 = 99
       \]
   - Therefore, on Wednesday, he sold 99 boxes.

4. **Calculating Earnings:**
   - Now, we calculate the earnings for each day:
     - **Monday:**
       - Earnings from cupcakes: 
         \[
         24 \times 10 = 240

       - Earnings from orange pies: 
         \[
         12 \times 22 = 264
         \]
       - Total earnings on Monday:
         \[
         240 + 264 = 504
         \]
     - **Tuesday:**
       - Earnings from cupcakes: 
         \[
         35 \times 10 = 350
         \]
       - Earnings from orange pies: 
         \[
         28 \times 22 = 616
         \]
       - Total earnings on Tuesday:
         \[
         350 + 616 = 966
         \]
     - **Wednesday:**
       - Earnings from cupcakes: 
         \[
         99 \times 10 = 990
         \]
       - Earnings from orange pies: 
         \[
         99 \times 22 = 2178
         \]
       - Total earnings on Wednesday:
         \[
         990 + 2178 = 3168
         \]

5. **Total Earnings Over Three Days:**
   - Total earnings over the three days:
     \[
     504 + 966 + 3168 = 4638
     \]

6. **Average Daily Earnings:**
   - To find the average daily earnings, we divide the total earnings by the number of days (3):
     \[
     \text{Average daily earnings} = \frac{4638}{3} = 1546

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of orange pies sold on Monday and Tuesday, which led to an incorrect total earnings calculation. I also failed to correctly sum the total earnings for each day, which resulted in an inaccurate average daily earning.

### Error Keywords:
- Misreading the problem
- Incorrect calculations
- Misinterpretation of relationships between quantities

### Solution:
1. **Identify the quantities sold each day:**
   - **Monday:**
     - Cupcakes: 24
     - Orange pies: 16 fewer than Tuesday
   - **Tuesday:**
     - Cupcakes: 24 + 11 = 35
     - Orange pies: 28

2. **Calculate the number of orange pies sold on Monday:**
   - Orange pies on Monday = Orange pies on Tuesday - 16 = 28 - 16 = 12

3. **Calculate the sales for Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined.
   - Total sold on Monday = 24 (cupcakes) + 12 (orange pies) = 36
   - Total sold on Tuesday = 35 (cupcakes) + 28 (orange pies) = 63
   - Total sold on Wednesday = 36 + 63 = 99

4. **Determine the number of items sold on Wednesday:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of cupcakes sold on Wednesday and \( y \) be the number of orange pies sold on Wednesday.
   - We know \( x + y = 99 \).

5. **Calculate total earnings for each day:**
   - **Monday:**
     - Earnings = (Cupcakes * Price of cupcakes) + (Orange pies * Price of orange pies)
     - Earnings = (24 * 10) + (12 * 22) = 240 + 264 = ₺504
   - **Tuesday:**
     - Earnings = (35 * 10) + (28 * 22) = 350 + 616 = ₺966
   - **Wednesday:**
     - We need to find the distribution of cupcakes and orange pies sold on Wednesday. Since we don't have specific numbers, we can assume he sold the same ratio as the previous days.
     - Total items sold on Monday and Tuesday = 36 + 63 = 99
     - Ratio of cupcakes to total items = 36/99 and orange pies = 63/99.
     - Therefore, on Wednesday:
       - Cupcakes = (36/99) * 99 = 36
       - Orange pies = (63/99) * 99 = 63
     - Earnings = (36 * 10) + (63 * 22) = 360 + 1386 = ₺1746

6. **Calculate total earnings over three days:**
   - Total earnings = ₺504 (Monday) + ₺966 (Tuesday) + ₺1746 (Wednesday) = ₺3216

7. **Calculate average daily earning:**
   - Average daily earning = Total earnings / Number of days = ₺3216 / 3 = ₺1072

### Instructions:
1. Carefully read the problem to identify the relationships between the quantities sold on different days.
2. Set up equations based on the information given for each day.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of boxes sold on each day, particularly the number of orange pies sold on Monday and Wednesday. I also failed to properly account for the total earnings from each type of item sold, which led to an incorrect average daily earning.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect totals
- Misunderstanding of relationships between quantities

### Solution:
1. **Identify the quantities sold:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of orange pies sold on Monday.
   - On Monday, Andre sold 24 cupcakes and \( x - 16 \) orange pies.
   - On Tuesday, he sold \( 24 + 11 = 35 \) cupcakes and 28 orange pies.
   - On Wednesday, he sold the total from Monday and Tuesday combined.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - From Monday: 
     - Orange pies sold = \( x - 16 \)
   - From Tuesday:
     - Orange pies sold = 28
   - Therefore, \( x - 16 = 28 \) leads to \( x = 44 \) (orange pies sold on Monday).

3. **Calculate the total boxes sold:**
   - **Monday:**
     - Cupcakes: 24
     - Orange pies: \( 44 - 16 = 28 \)
   - **Tuesday:**
     - Cupcakes: 35
     - Orange pies: 28
   - **Wednesday:**
     - Total from Monday and Tuesday:
       - Cupcakes: \( 24 + 35 = 59 \)
       - Orange pies: \( 28 + 28 = 56 \)

4. **Calculate total earnings for each day:**
   - **Monday Earnings:**
     - \( 24 \times 10 + 28 \times 22 = 240 + 616 = 856 \)
   - **Tuesday Earnings:**
     - \( 35 \times 10 + 28 \times 22 = 350 + 616 = 966 \)
   - **Wednesday Earnings:**
     - \( 59 \times 10 + 56 \times 22 = 590 + 1232 = 1822 \)

5. **Calculate total earnings over three days:**
   - Total earnings = \( 856 + 966 + 1822 = 3644 \)

6. **Calculate average daily earning:**
   - Average daily earning = \( \frac{3644}{3} \approx 1214.67 \)

### Final Answer:
Andre's average daily earning is approximately ₺1214.67.

### Instructions for Future Problems:
1. Carefully read the problem to identify all quantities and relationships.
2. Define variables for unknown quantities and set up equations based on the relationships described.
3. Calculate the number of items sold each day using the equations.
4. Compute the total earnings for each day by multiplying the number of items sold by their respective prices.
5. Sum the total earnings and divide by the number of days to find the average.

I answered the question incorrectly because I miscalculated the number of orange pies sold on Monday and Tuesday, which led to an incorrect total for the earnings. I also failed to correctly sum the total earnings for each day, which affected the average calculation.

### Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Calculation error
- Incorrect total
- Misapplication of relationships

### Solution:
1. **Identify the quantities sold:**
   - **Monday:**
     - Cupcakes: 24
     - Orange pies: \( x \) (where \( x \) is the number of orange pies sold on Tuesday minus 16)
   - **Tuesday:**
     - Cupcakes: \( 24 + 11 = 35 \)
     - Orange pies: 28

2. **Calculate the number of orange pies sold on Monday:**
   - Since he sold 16 fewer orange pies on Monday than on Tuesday:
   \[
   \text{Orange pies on Monday} = 28 - 16 = 12
   \]

3. **Calculate the total sales for each day:**
   - **Monday:**
     - Total boxes sold = 24 (cupcakes) + 12 (orange pies) = 36
     - Earnings = \( 24 \times 10 + 12 \times 22 = 240 + 264 = 504 \)
   - **Tuesday:**
     - Total boxes sold = 35 (cupcakes) + 28 (orange pies) = 63
     - Earnings = \( 35 \times 10 + 28 \times 22 = 350 + 616 = 966 \)
   - **Wednesday:**
     - Total boxes sold = Total from Monday + Total from Tuesday = 36 + 63 = 99
     - Earnings = \( 99 \times 10 + 99 \times 22 = 990 + 2178 = 3168 \)

4. **Calculate the total earnings over the three days:**
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 504 + 966 + 3168 = 4638
   \]

Half of the volleyball players are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the competition?",62.0,"To find out how many students are leaving early to the competition, we can break the problem down into steps.

1. **Calculate the number of volleyball players:**
   \[
   \text{Number of volleyball players} = 24\% \text{ of } 125 = 0.24 \times 125 = 30
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of remaining students after accounting for volleyball players:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 125 - 30 = 95
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of students who are robotics club members or part of the choir:**
   \[
   \text{Number of robotics club or choir members} = 40\% \text{ of } 95 = 0.40 \times 95 = 38
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of volleyball players who are leaving early (half are absent):**
   \[
   \text{Volleyball players leaving} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of students leaving early (volleyball players + robotics club/choir members):**
   \[
   \text{Total leaving early} = 15 + 38 = 53

7. **Calculate the total number of students leaving early including cheerleaders:**
   \[
   \text{Total students leaving early} = 53 + 9 = 62
   \]

Thus, the total number of students leaving early to the competition is \( \boxed{62} \).",62.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of volleyball players:**
   - There are 125 students in total.
   - 24% of the class are volleyball players.
   - To find the number of volleyball players, we calculate: 
     \[
     0.24 \times 125 = 30
     \]
   - So, there are 30 volleyball players.

2. **Calculate the number of remaining students:**
   - The number of students who are not volleyball players is:
     \[
     125 - 30 = 95
     \]
   - So, there are 95 remaining students.

3. **Calculate the number of robotics club members or choir members:**
   - 40% of the remaining students are robotics club members or choir members.
   - To find this number, we calculate:
     \[
     0.40 \times 95 = 38
     \]
   - So, there are 38 robotics club members or choir members.

4. **Calculate the number of students leaving early:**
   - The total number of students leaving early includes:
     - Volleyball players (30)
     - Robotics club members or choir members (38)
     - Cheerleaders (3 cheerleaders for each group)
   - The number of cheerleaders accompanying the volleyball players is 3.
   - The number of cheerleaders accompanying the robotics club members or choir members is also 3.
   - So, the total number of cheerleaders is:

[Example Input]
Question: In a school with 200 students, 30% are involved in sports. Out of the remaining students, 50% are in the drama club. If 10 students from the sports team are not attending practice, how many students are participating in sports or drama club?
Wrong answer: I calculated that 30% of 200 is 60, so I thought there were 60 sports students. Then I subtracted 10 for the absentees, giving me 50. I forgot to consider the drama club members, so I incorrectly concluded that 50 students are participating.
---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total number of students involved in both sports and drama club by not including the drama club members in my final count.
Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Omission
- Group counting error
Instructions:
1. Calculate the number of students involved in sports by finding 30% of 200.
2. Determine the number of remaining students by subtracting the sports students from the total.
3. Calculate the number of students in the drama club by finding 50% of the remaining students.
4. Subtract the number of absent sports students from the total sports participants.
5. Add the adjusted number of sports participants to the number of drama club members to find the total participating students.
Advice:
- Always double-check the groups involved in the problem.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid missing any components.
- Keep track of percentages and ensure all groups are accounted for in the final count.
Solution:
First, 30% of 200 is 60 (sports students). The remaining students are 200 - 60 = 140. Half of 140 is 70 (drama club members). After subtracting the 10 absent sports students, we have 60 - 10 = 50 sports participants. Therefore, the total participating students are 50 (sports) + 70 (drama) = 120 students.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I miscalculated the total number of students leaving early by not properly accounting for all groups involved. I failed to correctly calculate the number of volleyball players and the robotics club and choir members, and I also neglected to include the cheerleaders accompanying these groups.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Omission
- Group counting error
- Incorrect aggregation

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the number of volleyball players:**
   - 24% of 125 students = 0.24 * 125 = 30 students (volleyball players).

2. **Determine the number of remaining students:**
   - Remaining students = Total students - Volleyball players = 125 - 30 = 95 students.

3. **Calculate the number of robotics club members and choir members:**
   - 40% of the remaining students = 0.40 * 95 = 38 students (robotics club and choir members).

4. **Calculate the number of absent volleyball players:**
   - Half of the volleyball players are absent = 30 / 2 = 15 students (absent volleyball players).

5. **Calculate the total number of students leaving early:**
   - Total leaving early = Absent volleyball players + Robotics club and choir members + Cheerleaders.
   - Cheerleaders accompanying each group = 3 cheerleaders * 3 groups (volleyball, robotics, choir) = 3 * 3 = 9 cheerleaders.
   - Total leaving early = 15 (absent volleyball players) + 38 (robotics and choir members) + 9 (cheerleaders) = 62 students.

### Advice:
- Always ensure to calculate each group separately and verify that all groups are included in the final count.
- Break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps to avoid confusion.
- Double-check calculations, especially when dealing with percentages and group totals.
- Keep track of any additional groups or individuals that may need to be included in the final answer.

### New Answer:
The total number of students leaving early to the competition is **62 students**.","--- Beginning of the template ---

[Example Input]
Question: In a school with 200 students, 30% are involved in sports. Out of the remaining students, 50% are in the drama club. If 10 students from the sports team are not attending practice, how many students are participating in sports or drama club?
Wrong answer: I calculated that 30% of 200 is 60, so I thought there were 60 sports students. Then I subtracted 10 for the absentees, giving me 50. I forgot to consider the drama club members, so I incorrectly concluded that 50 students are participating.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total number of students involved in both sports and drama club by not including the drama club members in my final count.
Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Omission
- Group counting error
Instructions:
1. Calculate the number of students involved in sports by finding 30% of 200.
2. Determine the number of remaining students by subtracting the sports students from the total.
3. Calculate the number of students in the drama club by finding 50% of the remaining students.
4. Subtract the number of absent sports students from the total sports participants.
5. Add the adjusted number of sports participants to the number of drama club members to find the total participating students.
Advice:
- Always double-check the groups involved in the problem.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid missing any components.
- Keep track of percentages and ensure all groups are accounted for in the final count.
Solution:
First, 30% of 200 is 60 (sports students). The remaining students are 200 - 60 = 140. Half of 140 is 70 (drama club members). After subtracting the 10 absent sports students, we have 60 - 10 = 50 sports participants. Therefore, the total participating students are 50 (sports) + 70 (drama) = 120 students.

Mei's flowers grow 3feet wide so she needs to leave 13 feet between every plant (including the plants width). Mei already owns 8 flowers. Each flowering plant costs €9 at the store. However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a €5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Mei spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",22.0,"To determine how much money Mei will spend at the store to fill her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total width occupied by each plant including the space between them.**
   - Each flower is 3 feet wide.
   - Mei needs to leave 13 feet between each plant.
   - Therefore, the total width occupied by each plant (including the space) is:
     \[
     3 \text{ feet (width of the plant)} + 13 \text{ feet (space)} = 16 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine how many plants can fit in the flower bed.**
   - The flower bed is 143 feet long.
   - To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the total width occupied by each plant:
     \[
     \text{Number of plants} = \frac{143 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ feet/plant}} \approx 8.9375
     \]
   - Since Mei can only plant whole plants, we round down to 8 plants.

3. **Calculate how many additional plants Mei needs to buy.**
   - Mei already owns 8 flowers, and since she can fit 8 plants in total, she does not need to buy any additional plants:
     \[
     \text{Additional plants needed} = 8 - 8 = 0
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the plants.**
   - Since Mei does not need to buy any additional plants, her total cost is €0.

5. **Final calculation of the total cost.**
   - Since she is not buying any new plants, the total amount Mei will spend at the store is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = €0
     \]

Thus, Mei will spend **€0** at the store to fill up her flower bed.",0.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the total width occupied by each plant**: Each flower grows 3 feet wide, and Mei needs to leave 13 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space occupied by each plant (including the space between them) is:
   \[
   3 \text{ feet (width of the plant)} + 13 \text{ feet (space)} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many plants can fit in the flower bed**: Mei's flower bed is 143 feet long. To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space occupied by each plant:
   \[
   \frac{143 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ feet per plant}} \approx 8.9375
   \]
   Since Mei can only plant whole plants, we round down to 8 plants.

3. **Determine how many more plants Mei needs**: Mei already owns 8 flowers, and since she can fit 8 plants in total, she does not need to buy any more plants:
   \[
   8 \text{ (plants needed)} - 8 \text{ (plants owned)} = 0 \text{ (plants to buy)}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the plants**: Since Mei does not need to buy any more plants, the total cost is:
   \[
   0 \text{ plants} \times €9 \text{ per plant} = €0

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of trees that could fit in the garden by not considering the total width of each tree and the spacing required between them. I also failed to apply the discount correctly.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Spacing
- Discount application

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total width occupied by each tree and the space needed between them.
2. Determine how many trees can fit in the garden by dividing the total length by the width of each tree plus the space required.
3. Subtract the number of trees Alex already has from the total number of trees that can fit to find out how many more he needs to buy.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of trees purchased and apply any discounts if applicable.

Advice:
- Always double-check the calculations for spacing and dimensions.
- Keep track of any existing items to avoid overestimating the number needed.
- Be mindful of discount conditions and ensure they are applied correctly.

Solution:
To solve the problem, first calculate the total width for each tree and the space: 4 feet (tree) + 10 feet (space) = 14 feet. The total number of trees that can fit is 120 feet / 14 feet = 8.57, so Alex can fit 8 trees. Since he already has 5, he needs to buy 3 more. The cost for 3 trees is $30, and since he is buying more than 3 trees, he gets a $7 discount, making the total $23.

I answered the question incorrectly by not performing any calculations. I mistakenly provided a placeholder answer of ""0.0"" without analyzing the problem or determining how many plants Mei could fit in her flower bed. This lack of calculation led to an incorrect response.

### Error Keywords:
- No calculation
- Misunderstanding of spacing
- Failure to analyze the problem

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the total space each plant occupies**: 
   - Each plant is 3 feet wide, and there is a 13-foot space between each plant. 
   - Total space per plant = 3 feet (width) + 13 feet (spacing) = 16 feet.

2. **Determine how many plants can fit in the flower bed**:
   - Total length of the flower bed = 143 feet.
   - Number of plants that can fit = 143 feet / 16 feet = 8.9375. Since we can only have whole plants, Mei can fit 8 plants.

3. **Calculate how many more plants Mei needs to buy**:
   - Mei already owns 8 plants.
   - Total plants that can fit = 8.
   - Therefore, Mei does not need to buy any more plants (0 additional plants).

4. **Calculate the total cost based on the number of plants to be purchased**:
   - Since Mei needs to buy 0 additional plants, the total cost = 0 plants x €9 = €0.

5. **Check if the discount applies**:
   - Since Mei is not buying any additional plants, the discount does not apply.

### Final Answer:
Mei will spend €0 at the store to fill up her flower bed since she already has enough plants.

Each tree costs $15 at the nursery, but if he buys more than 3 trees, he will receive a $10 discount on the total purchase. How much money will Alex spend at the nursery to fill his garden?

Wrong answer: Alex calculated that he could fit 10 trees in the garden, so he decided to buy 5 more trees. He thought the total cost would be 5 trees x $15 = $75, and he forgot to apply the discount. He concluded that he would spend $75.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of trees that could fit in the garden by not accounting for the total space each tree and the gaps would take up. I also forgot to apply the discount for buying more than 3 trees.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Spacing error
- Discount omission

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total space each tree occupies (tree width + space between trees).
2. Determine how many trees can fit in the garden by dividing the total length of the garden by the space each tree occupies.
3. Subtract the number of trees Alex already has from the total number of trees that can fit to find out how many more he needs to buy.
4. Calculate the total cost of the trees he needs to buy.
5. Check if the number of trees purchased qualifies for a discount and apply it if applicable.

Advice:
- Always double-check the calculations for spacing and dimensions.
- Keep track of any existing items (like trees) before calculating how many more are needed.
- Be mindful of any discounts or promotions that may apply to the total purchase.

Solution:
1. Each tree occupies 4 feet (width) + 10 feet (space) = 14 feet.
2. The number of trees that can fit in the garden is 120 feet / 14 feet = approximately 8.57, so Alex can fit 8 trees.
3. Alex already has 5 trees, so he needs to buy 8 - 5 = 3 more trees.
4. The total cost for 3 trees is 3 x $15 = $45.
5. Since he is buying more than 3 trees, he qualifies for a $10 discount, making the total cost $45 - $10 = $35.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly by providing a total cost of €0.0 without performing any calculations. I failed to analyze the problem and determine how many plants Mei could fit in her flower bed, how many more she needed to buy, and the total cost involved. 

### Error Keywords:
- Calculation omission
- Misunderstanding of problem requirements
- Lack of analysis

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the total space each plant occupies**: Each plant is 3 feet wide, and there is a 13-foot gap between each plant. Therefore, the total space each plant occupies is:
   \[
   \text{Total space per plant} = \text{Width of plant} + \text{Space between plants} = 3 \text{ feet} + 13 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Determine how many plants can fit in the flower bed**: The flower bed is 143 feet long. To find out how many plants can fit, divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space each plant occupies:
   \[
   \text{Number of plants that can fit} = \frac{143 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ feet}} \approx 8.9375
   \]
   Since we can only have whole plants, Mei can fit 8 plants in her flower bed.

3. **Calculate how many more plants Mei needs to buy**: Mei already owns 8 plants, so:
   \[
   \text{Plants needed} = \text{Plants that can fit} - \text{Plants already owned} = 8 - 8 = 0
   \]
   Mei does not need to buy any more plants.

4. **Calculate the total cost of the plants**: Since Mei does not need to buy any more plants, the total cost is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 0 \text{ plants} \times €9 = €0
   \]

5. **Check for discounts**: Since Mei is not buying any additional plants, the discount does not apply.

### Final Answer:
Mei will spend €0 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

### Instructions for Future Problems:
1. Read the problem carefully to understand the requirements and constraints.
2. Identify the dimensions and spacing requirements for the items involved.
3. Calculate the total space each item occupies, including any gaps.
4. Determine how many items can fit within the given space.
5. Subtract any existing items from the total needed to find out how many more are required.
6. Calculate the total cost based on the number of items needed and check for any applicable discounts.

### General Advice for Similar Problems:
- Always perform calculations step-by-step to avoid missing important details.
- Keep track of existing quantities before determining how many more are needed.
- Be mindful of any discounts or promotions that may affect the total cost.
- Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy before finalizing your answer.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

How long will it take her to peel and saute 60 clams if it takes 19 minutes to wash all the clams? Note that Yara can't work in parallel.,53.0,"To determine how long it will take Yara to peel and sauté 60 clams, we need to break down the tasks and calculate the time for each step.

1. **Washing the clams**: 
   - It takes Yara 19 minutes to wash all the clams.

2. **Peeling the clams**: 
   - Yara can peel 6 clams per minute.
   - For 60 clams, the time taken to peel them is:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel} = \frac{60 \text{ clams}}{6 \text{ clams/min}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Sautéing the clams**: 
   - Yara can sauté 20 clams in 8 minutes.
   - To find out how long it takes to sauté 60 clams, we first determine how many batches of 20 clams are in 60 clams:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{60 \text{ clams}}{20 \text{ clams/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 8 minutes, the total time to sauté 60 clams is:
     \[
     \text{Time to sauté} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 8 \text{ minutes/batch} = 24 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Total time**: 
   - Now, we add the time for washing, peeling, and sautéing:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time to wash} + \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to sauté}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 19 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} + 24 \text{ minutes} = 53 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time it will take Yara to peel and sauté 60 clams is **53 minutes**.",53.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Washing the clams**: Yara takes 19 minutes to wash all the clams.

2. **Peeling the clams**: Yara can peel 6 clams a minute. To find out how long it takes her to peel 60 clams, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Time to peel} = \frac{60 \text{ clams}}{6 \text{ clams/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Sauteing the clams**: Yara can saute 20 clams in 8 minutes. To find out how long it takes her to saute 60 clams, we first determine how many batches of 20 clams are in 60 clams:
   \[
   \text{Number of batches} = \frac{60 \text{ clams}}{20 \text{ clams/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
   \]
   Now, we calculate the time for 3 batches:
   \[
   \text{Time to saute} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 8 \text{ minutes/batch} = 24 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Total time**: Now we add the time for washing, peeling, and sauteing:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time to wash} + \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to saute} = 19 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} + 24 \text{ minutes} = 53 \text{ minutes}

Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet. How much older is Liam's uncle than Liam?,22.0,"Let \( u \) be the age of Liam's uncle when he first saw Comet Halley, which is 31 years old. 

Since Comet Halley orbits the Sun every 53 years, we can determine the age of Liam's uncle when he saw the comet for the second time:

\[
u + 53 = 31 + 53 = 84
\]

Now, let \( l \) be Liam's age when he saw the comet for the second time. According to the problem, Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was twice the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet:

\[
l = 2 \times u = 2 \times 31 = 62
\]

Now we know that Liam was 62 years old when he saw the comet for the second time. 

Next, we need to find out how much older Liam's uncle is than Liam. We already established that Liam's uncle is 84 years old when he saw the comet for the second time. 

To find the age difference, we calculate:

\[
\text{Age difference} = \text{Uncle's age} - \text{Liam's age} = 84 - 62 = 22
\]

Thus, Liam's uncle is \( \boxed{22} \) years older than Liam.",22.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Liam's uncle saw Comet Halley when he was 31 years old.
2. The comet orbits the Sun every 53 years, so the next time it appears, Liam's uncle will be 31 + 53 = 84 years old.
3. Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he first saw the comet. 
4. Since Liam's uncle was 31 years old when he first saw the comet, two times that age is 2 * 31 = 62 years.
5. Therefore, Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was 62 years old.
6. Now, we need to find out how much older Liam's uncle is than Liam. 
7. When Liam was 62 years old, his uncle was 84 years old (as calculated in step 2).

2. The Williams twins each found 26 toys. Since there are two twins, the total number of toys they found is:
   \( 26 + 26 = 52 \) toys.
3. To find out how many toys were found by their friends, we first need to determine how many toys are left after the twins found theirs. The remaining toys are:
   \( 100 - 52 = 48 \) toys.
4. According to the problem, all the remaining toys except 16 were found by their friends. This means the friends found:
   \( 48 - 16 = 32 \) toys.
5. Now, we need to calculate the percentage of the initially hidden toys that the friends found. The formula for percentage is:
   \[

He can mine twice as much with one bronze pickaxe and 80% more with a diamond pickaxe than with one bronze pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 11 miners mine in a month with 28 days if they all use bronze pickaxe in the first half, and then switch to diamond pickaxes in the second half of the month?",4312.0,"To solve the problem, we first need to determine how much ore one miner can mine with a bronze pickaxe and a diamond pickaxe.

1. **Mining with a basic shovel**:
   - One miner can mine 5 pounds of ore per day.

2. **Mining with a bronze pickaxe**:
   - A bronze pickaxe allows the miner to mine twice as much as with a basic shovel.
   - Therefore, with a bronze pickaxe, one miner can mine:
     \[
     2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds per day}
     \]

3. **Mining with a diamond pickaxe**:
   - A diamond pickaxe allows the miner to mine 80% more than with a bronze pickaxe.
   - First, we calculate 80% of the amount mined with a bronze pickaxe:
     \[
     0.8 \times 10 = 8 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Therefore, with a diamond pickaxe, one miner can mine:
     \[
     10 + 8 = 18 \text{ pounds per day}
     \]

Now we know the daily mining capacities:
- With a bronze pickaxe: 10 pounds per day
- With a diamond pickaxe: 18 pounds per day

Next, we calculate the total amount of ore mined by 11 miners over the course of the month, which consists of 28 days, with the first 14 days using bronze pickaxes and the last 14 days using diamond pickaxes.

4. **Mining in the first half of the month (14 days with bronze pickaxes)**:
   - Total ore mined by one miner in 14 days:
     \[
     10 \text{ pounds/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 140 \text{ pounds}

1. **Total seats in the Sports Arena**: 9400
2. **Seats reserved for graduates**: 900
3. **Seats reserved for faculty**: 300
4. **Seats reserved for staff**: 100

Now, we can calculate the total number of seats that are reserved:

\[
\text{Total reserved seats} = \text{Seats for graduates} + \text{Seats for faculty} + \text{Seats for staff}

Now, we need to determine how many graduates there are. Since the problem does not specify the number of graduates, we will assume that the number of graduates is equal to the number of seats reserved for them, which is 900.

Now, we can calculate how many tickets each graduate would receive by dividing the available seats for guests by the number of graduates:

\[
\text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{\text{Available seats for guests}}{\text{Number of graduates}}

They agree to split it with Tara getting 190 yards more than Ananya, and Umar getting 30 yards more than Tara. How much is left over for Ananya?",150.0,"Let's denote the amount of fence Ananya gets as \( A \) yards. According to the problem, Tara gets 190 yards more than Ananya, so we can express Tara's amount as:

\[
T = A + 190

Umar gets 30 yards more than Tara, so we can express Umar's amount as:

\[
U = T + 30 = (A + 190) + 30 = A + 220
\]

Now, we can set up an equation for the total amount of fence:

\[
A + T + U = 860
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( T \) and \( U \) into the equation gives us:

\[
A + (A + 190) + (A + 220) = 860

Now, combine like terms:

\[
A + A + 190 + A + 220 = 860

This simplifies to:

\[
3A + 410 = 860

He then spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?",33.0,"To find out how many hours a week Santiago spends learning, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total class time for the week:**
   - Santiago has 6 periods in a day, and he takes 3 extra classes. Therefore, he has a total of:
     \[
     6 + 3 = 9 \text{ classes per day}
     \]
   - Each class is 30 minutes long, so the total class time per day is:
     \[
     9 \text{ classes} \times 30 \text{ minutes/class} = 270 \text{ minutes/day}
     \]
   - He goes to class for 4 days a week, so the total class time for the week is:
     \[
     270 \text{ minutes/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 1080 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total review time for the week:**
   - Santiago spends 15 minutes reviewing before each of his 3 extra classes. Therefore, the total review time per day is:
     \[
     3 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ minutes/class} = 45 \text{ minutes/day}

Thus, Santiago spends approximately **58.33 hours a week** learning.",58.33,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of periods Santiago has in a day:**
   - He has 6 normal periods.
   - He takes 3 extra classes.
   - So, the total number of periods in a day is 6 + 3 = 9 periods.

2. **Calculate the total time spent in classes each day:**
   - Each class is 30 minutes long.
   - He has 3 extra classes, so the total time for extra classes is 3 * 30 = 90 minutes.
   - The total time spent in normal classes (6 periods) is not specified, but we will focus on the extra classes for now.

3. **Calculate the total review time before each extra class:**
   - He spends 15 minutes reviewing before each of the 3 extra classes.
   - So, the total review time is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time spent in classes and review each day:**
   - Total time spent in extra classes = 90 minutes.
   - Total review time = 45 minutes.
   - So, the total time spent each day is 90 + 45 = 135 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time spent in classes and review for 4 days:**
   - He goes to class for 4 days a week.

[Example Input]
Question: A student has 5 classes each day, and each class lasts 45 minutes. Additionally, the student spends 10 minutes reviewing notes after each class. If the student attends classes for 5 days a week, how many hours does the student spend in class and reviewing notes each week?
Wrong answer: I calculated the total time spent in class as 5 classes * 45 minutes = 225 minutes. Then I added 5 classes * 10 minutes = 50 minutes for review, giving a total of 275 minutes. I mistakenly thought this was the total for the week and divided by 60 to get 4.58 hours, but I forgot to multiply by 5 days.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total weekly time by not considering that the daily total needed to be multiplied by the number of days attended.
Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Daily total
- Weekly total
- Multiplication error
Instructions:
1. Calculate the total time spent in class for one day (number of classes * duration of each class).
2. Calculate the total review time for one day (number of classes * review time per class).
3. Add the daily class time and review time to get the total time spent in one day.
4. Multiply the daily total by the number of days attended to find the weekly total.
5. Convert the total minutes into hours by dividing by 60.
Advice:
- Always double-check that you are considering the total time over the correct period (daily vs. weekly).
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid missing steps.
- Keep track of units (minutes vs. hours) to ensure accurate conversions.
Solution:
The correct reasoning is: Daily class time = 5 * 45 = 225 minutes; Daily review time = 5 * 10 = 50 minutes; Total daily time = 225 + 50 = 275 minutes. Weekly total = 275 * 5 = 1375 minutes. Converting to hours: 1375 / 60 = 22.92 hours. Thus, the student spends approximately 22.92 hours a week learning.

He then spends one-ninth of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 46.33
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I miscalculated the total time Santiago spends learning by not properly accounting for the total number of classes he attends each day and the additional learning time on the weekend. I also failed to correctly convert the total minutes into hours.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Class count
- Daily total
- Weekly total
- Conversion error

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the total number of classes per day:**
   - Regular classes: 6 periods
   - Extra classes: 3
   - Total classes per day = 6 + 3 = 9 classes

2. **Calculate the total time spent in class for one day:**
   - Duration of each class = 30 minutes
   - Total class time per day = 9 classes * 30 minutes = 270 minutes

3. **Calculate the total review time for one day:**
   - Review time before each class = 15 minutes
   - Total review time per day = 9 classes * 15 minutes = 135 minutes

4. **Calculate the total time spent in one day:**
   - Total daily time = Total class time + Total review time
   - Total daily time = 270 minutes + 135 minutes = 405 minutes

5. **Calculate the total time spent in class and reviewing notes for the week:**
   - Santiago goes to class for 4 days a week.
   - Total weekly time = Total daily time * 4 days = 405 minutes * 4 = 1620 minutes

6. **Calculate the extra learning time on the weekend:**
   - Total weekly minutes = 1620 minutes
   - Extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday = (1/9) * 1620 minutes = 180 minutes each day
   - Total weekend learning time = 180 minutes + 180 minutes = 360 minutes

7. **Calculate the total learning time for the week:**
   - Total learning time for the week = Total weekly time + Total weekend learning time
   - Total learning time = 1620 minutes + 360 minutes = 1980 minutes

8. **Convert the total minutes into hours:**
   - Total hours = 1980 minutes / 60 = 33 hours

### Instructions:
1. Identify the total number of classes per day, including any extra classes.
2. Calculate the total time spent in class for one day (number of classes * duration of each class).
3. Calculate the total review time for one day (number of classes * review time per class).
4. Add the daily class time and review time to get the total time spent in one day.
5. Multiply the daily total by the number of days attended to find the weekly total.
6. Calculate any additional learning time outside of regular classes.
7. Add the additional learning time to the weekly total.
8. Convert the total minutes into hours by dividing by 60.

### Advice:

How much will the supermarket have received after all the balls are sold?",220.0,"To find out how much the supermarket will receive after all the balls are sold, we first need to calculate the total cost of each type of ball, then apply the discount, and finally sum the amounts.

1. **Calculate the total cost of each type of ball:**

   - **Blue balls:**
     - Number of blue balls = 9
     - Cost per blue ball = ₣12
     - Total cost for blue balls = 9 * 12 = ₣108

   - **Purple balls:**
     - Number of purple balls = 11
     - Cost per purple ball = ₣9
     - Total cost for purple balls = 11 * 9 = ₣99

   - **Pink balls:**
     - Number of pink balls = 17
     - Cost per pink ball = ₣4
     - Total cost for pink balls = 17 * 4 = ₣68

p1,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Olivia walks 20 kilometers every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 kilometers of walking on the beach and 10 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?",75.0,"Let \( v \) be Olivia's original speed on the beach in kilometers per hour. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is \( 4v \).

Due to her injury, her speed on the beach is now \( \frac{v}{2} \) and her speed on the sidewalk is \( \frac{4v}{2} = 2v \).

We know that Olivia spends 60 minutes walking on the beach. Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, we can calculate the distance she covers on the beach:

\[
\text{Distance on the beach} = \text{Speed on the beach} \times \text{Time on the beach}
\]
\[
10 \text{ km} = \left(\frac{v}{2}\right) \times 1 \text{ hour}

From this equation, we can solve for \( v \):

\[
10 = \frac{v}{2}
\]
\[
v = 20 \text{ km/h}
\]

Now we can find her speed on the beach and sidewalk after her injury:

- Speed on the beach: \( \frac{v}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ km/h} \)
- Speed on the sidewalk: \( 2v = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ km/h} \)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for her to walk the 10 kilometers on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10 \text{ km}}{40 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ minutes}

Now, we can find the total time for her entire 20-kilometer walk:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time on the beach} + \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 60 \text{ minutes} + 15 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ minutes}

1. Olivia walks a total of 20 kilometers every day, which includes 10 kilometers on the beach and 10 kilometers on the sidewalk.

2. On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the speed she does on the beach. Let's denote her original speed on the beach as \( v \). Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is \( 4v \).

3. Due to her recent injury, her speed has decreased by half. So, her new speed on the beach is \( \frac{v}{2} \) and her new speed on the sidewalk is \( \frac{4v}{2} = 2v \).

4. We know that Olivia spends 60 minutes walking on the beach. Since she walks 10 kilometers on the beach, we can find her speed on the beach:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \implies 60 = \frac{10}{\frac{v}{2}} \implies 60 = \frac{20}{v} \implies v = \frac{20}{60} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ km/min}
   \]

5. Now, we can find her new speed on the beach:
   \[
   \text{New speed on the beach} = \frac{v}{2} = \frac{1/3}{2} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ km/min}
   \]

6. Next, we calculate the time it takes her to walk the 10 kilometers on the sidewalk:
   \[
   \text{New speed on the sidewalk} = 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ km/min}

   \[
   \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{10}{\frac{2}{3}} = 10 \times \frac{3}{2} = 15 \text{ minutes}

   \text{Noah's eggs} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ eggs}
   \]

6. Now, we calculate how many eggs Tara and James found combined:
   \[
   \text{Tara's and James's eggs combined} = 20 + 4 = 24 \text{ eggs}
   \]

7. Oscar finds four dozen eggs more than Tara and James combined. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we calculate:
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs}
   \]
   Therefore, Oscar finds:
   \[
   \text{Oscar's eggs} = 24 + 48 = 72 \text{ eggs}
   \]

8. Now, we add up all the eggs found:
   \[
   \text{Total eggs found} = 4 + 20 + 16 + 8 + 72 = 120 \text{ eggs}
   \]

9. Finally, we calculate how many eggs are still hidden in the yard:
   \[
   \text{Eggs still hidden} = 132 - 120 = 12 \text{ eggs}
   \]

The first 2 have 300 apartments each and the last one is 50% bigger than the other 2 combined. Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each place and he gets paid ¥0.45 per collection for each apartment. He also earns 14% on tips. How much money does he make in a week?,1539.0,"To calculate how much money Oliver makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of apartments in each complex:**
   - The first two complexes each have 300 apartments.
   - The total number of apartments in the first two complexes is:
     \[
     300 + 300 = 600 \text{ apartments}
     \]
   - The last complex is 50% bigger than the first two combined. Therefore, the number of apartments in the last complex is:
     \[
     600 \times 1.5 = 900 \text{ apartments}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of apartments:**
   - The total number of apartments across all three complexes is:
     \[
     600 + 900 = 1500 \text{ apartments}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of collections per week:**
   - Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each complex. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:
     \[
     2 \text{ collections/week} \times 3 \text{ complexes} = 6 \text{ collections/week}
     \]

4. **Calculate the earnings from collections:**
   - Oliver earns ¥0.45 per collection for each apartment. Therefore, his earnings from collections per week is:
     \[
     1500 \text{ apartments} \times 6 \text{ collections/week} \times ¥0.45 = 1500 \times 6 \times 0.45
     \]
   - First, calculate \(1500 \times 6\):
     \[
     1500 \times 6 = 9000
     \]
   - Now, calculate \(9000 \times 0.45\):
     \[
     9000 \times 0.45 = 4050
     \]
   - So, Oliver earns ¥4050 from collections in a week.

5. **Calculate the tips:**
   - Oliver earns 14% on tips. Assuming he receives tips, we need to calculate the total earnings including tips. However, since the problem does not specify the amount of tips, we will denote the total tips as \(T\).
   - His earnings from tips would be:
     \[
     0.14T
     \]

6. **Calculate total earnings:**
   - The total earnings for Oliver in a week, including tips, would be:
     \[
     \text{Total Earnings} = 4050 + 0.14T
     \]

Since we do not have a specific value for \(T\), we can conclude that Oliver's earnings from collections alone is ¥4050, and his total earnings will depend on the amount of tips he receives. If you have a specific amount for tips, you can substitute \(T\) into the equation to find the total earnings.",4050.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:**
   - The first complex has 300 apartments.
   - The second complex also has 300 apartments.
   - So, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is:
     \[
     300 + 300 = 600 \text{ apartments}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex:**
   - The third complex is 50% bigger than the first two combined.
   - The total number of apartments in the first two complexes is 600.
   - 50% of 600 is:
     \[
     0.5 \times 600 = 300 \text{ apartments}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of apartments in the third complex is:
     \[
     600 + 300 = 900 \text{ apartments}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of apartments across all complexes:**
   - Total apartments = apartments in the first complex + apartments in the second complex + apartments in the third complex:
     \[
     300 + 300 + 900 = 1500 \text{ apartments}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of collections Oliver makes in a week:**
   - Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each complex.
   - Since there are 3 complexes, the total number of collections per week is:
     \[
     3 \text{ complexes} \times 2 \text{ collections} = 6 \text{ collections}
     \]

5. **Calculate the payment Oliver receives for the collections:**
   - He gets paid ¥0.45 per collection for each apartment.
   - The total payment for all collections is:
     \[
     1500 \text{ apartments} \times 0.45 \text{ ¥/apartment} \times 6 \text{ collections} = 1500 \times 0.45 \times 6
     \]
   - First, calculate \(1500 \times 0.45\):
     \[
     1500 \times 0.45 = 675 \text{ ¥}
     \]
   - Now, multiply by the number of collections:
     \[
     675 \times 6 = 4050 \text{ ¥}
     \]

6. **Calculate the tips Oliver earns:**
   - He earns 14% on tips from his total payment.
   - The amount from tips is:
     \[
     0.14 \times 4050 = 567 \text{ ¥}
     \]

7. **Calculate the total earnings for the week:**
   - Total earnings = payment from collections + tips:
     \[
     4050 + 567 = 4617 \text{ ¥}
     \]

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I miscalculated the total earnings by not accurately determining the number of apartments in the last complex and how that affects the total collections. I also failed to properly calculate the total earnings from tips based on the correct total earnings from collections.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect determination of total units (apartments)
- Failure to apply percentages correctly

### Solution:
1. **Determine the number of apartments:**
   - First two complexes: 300 apartments each.
   - Total for the first two complexes: \(300 + 300 = 600\) apartments.
   - The last complex is 50% bigger than the first two combined:
     \[
     \text{Size of last complex} = 1.5 \times 600 = 900 \text{ apartments}
     \]
   - Total apartments across all complexes:
     \[
     600 + 900 = 1500 \text{ apartments}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total collections per week:**
   - Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each complex:
     \[
     \text{Total collections per week} = 1500 \text{ apartments} \times 2 \text{ collections} = 3000 \text{ collections}
     \]
   - Earnings from collections:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from collections} = 3000 \text{ collections} \times ¥0.45 = ¥1350
     \]

3. **Calculate the earnings from tips:**
   - Tips are 14% of the earnings from collections:
     \[
     \text{Tips} = 0.14 \times ¥1350 = ¥189
     \]

4. **Calculate the total earnings for the week:**
   - Total earnings:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = ¥1350 + ¥189 = ¥1539
     \]

How many slices of pear did they all eat on average?",12.0,"To find the average number of slices of pear that Leilani, her sister, and her brother ate, we first need to determine how many slices each person ate.

1. **Leilani's slices**: 
   \[
   \text{Leilani ate} = 3 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Sister's slices**: 
   Her sister ate 12 more slices than Leilani:
   \[
   \text{Sister's slices} = 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Brother's slices**: 
   Her brother ate 3 more slices than her sister:
   \[
   \text{Brother's slices} = 15 + 3 = 18 \text{ slices}

Now, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by all three:
\[
\text{Total slices eaten} = \text{Leilani's slices} + \text{Sister's slices} + \text{Brother's slices}

If a kilogram of trout costs $2.25, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?",738.0,"To find out how much Jin will earn after selling all the trouts, we first need to calculate the total weight of the trouts he caught.

1. **Weights of the trouts:**
   - First trout: 62 kg
   - Second trout: 31 kg
   - The third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh trouts each weigh 16 kg more than the second trout.

   The weight of the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh trouts can be calculated as follows:
   - Weight of the third trout: \( 31 + 16 = 47 \) kg
   - Weight of the fourth trout: \( 31 + 16 = 47 \) kg
   - Weight of the fifth trout: \( 31 + 16 = 47 \) kg
   - Weight of the sixth trout: \( 31 + 16 = 47 \) kg
   - Weight of the seventh trout: \( 31 + 16 = 47 \) kg

2. **Total weight of all trouts:**
   Now we can sum the weights of all the trouts:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 62 + 31 + 47 + 47 + 47 + 47 + 47
   \]

   Let's calculate this step by step:
   - First, add the first two trouts:
     \[
     62 + 31 = 93 \text{ kg}
     \]
   - Next, add the weights of the remaining five trouts:
     \[

   - Now, add these two results together:
     \[
     93 + 235 = 328 \text{ kg}

3. **Calculating the earnings:**
   Jin sells the trouts at $2.25 per kilogram. Therefore, his total earnings can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Earnings} = \text{Total weight} \times \text{Price per kg} = 328 \times 2.25

   - Cost for the next 24 minutes = 24 * 0.5 = ¥12.0.

3. The remaining time is from minute 35 to minute 94, which is 60 minutes (94 - 34 = 60).
   - The cost for this period is ¥0.1 for every 2 minutes.
   - Therefore, for 60 minutes, we have 60 / 2 = 30 units of 2 minutes.
   - Cost for the last 60 minutes = 30 * 0.1 = ¥3.0.

If they work for 6 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?",60.0,"To determine the percentage of the maintenance worker's day spent cleaning floors, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the time taken to clean one floor after the injury:**
   - Originally, it took 6 minutes per floor.
   - Due to the injury, it now takes twice as long: 
     \[
     6 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 12 \text{ minutes per floor}

   \]

4. Next, we need to convert the total cleaning time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
   \[
   2160 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 36 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. The maintenance worker works for 6 hours a day. To find out how many days it will take to clean all the floors, we divide the total hours by the hours worked per day:
   \[
   36 \text{ hours} \div 6 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ days}
   \]

6. Now, we need to find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning floors. Since they work for 6 hours a day and spend 6 hours cleaning, the percentage of their day spent cleaning is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{6 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100\% = 100\%

[Example Input]
Question: A gardener has to plant 120 trees in a park. They have 8 days to complete the task. It takes them 5 minutes to plant each tree. However, due to fatigue, they now take 10 minutes per tree. If they work for 5 hours a day, what percentage of their day is spent planting trees?
Wrong answer: I calculated that they would spend 50% of their day planting trees, but I forgot to convert the total minutes into hours correctly and miscalculated the total time spent.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total time spent planting the trees by not converting the minutes into hours correctly. I also failed to account for the total working hours in a day accurately.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Time conversion error
- Percentage calculation error

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total time needed to complete the task (number of trees × time per tree).
2. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.
3. Determine the total working hours available (hours per day × number of days).
4. Calculate the percentage of the day spent on the task (time spent / total working hours × 100).

Advice:
- Always double-check your unit conversions (minutes to hours).
- Break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid confusion.
- Keep track of the total time and working hours to ensure accurate percentage calculations.

Solution:
To plant 120 trees at 10 minutes per tree, the total time needed is 120 trees × 10 minutes/tree = 1200 minutes. Converting this to hours gives 1200 minutes ÷ 60 = 20 hours. The total working hours over 8 days is 5 hours/day × 8 days = 40 hours. The percentage of the day spent planting trees is (20 hours / 40 hours) × 100 = 50%. Thus, the correct answer is 50%.

Now, look at this question:
Question: A maintenance worker has to clean a university with 180 floors. They have 10 days to get it done. It takes them 6 minutes per floor. However, due to a recent injury, the maintenance worker has become slower and it will take them twice as long to clean a floor these days. If they work for 6 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 100.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly by assuming that the maintenance worker would spend the entire day cleaning floors without properly calculating the total time required for the task. I also failed to consider the total working hours available over the 10 days, which led to an incorrect percentage calculation.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Time estimation error
- Percentage calculation error
- Assumption error

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the time needed to clean one floor:**
   - Due to the injury, it now takes the worker twice as long to clean a floor. Originally, it took 6 minutes per floor, so now it takes:
     \[
     6 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 12 \text{ minutes per floor}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time needed to clean all floors:**
   - For 180 floors, the total time required is:
     \[
     180 \text{ floors} \times 12 \text{ minutes/floor} = 2160 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - To convert minutes to hours:
     \[
     2160 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 36 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the total working hours available:**
   - The worker works for 6 hours a day for 10 days:
     \[
     6 \text{ hours/day} \times 10 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning floors:**
   - The percentage of the total working hours spent cleaning is:
     \[
     \left( \frac{36 \text{ hours}}{60 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 60\%
     \]

Thus, the correct answer is **60%**.

### Instructions:
1. Identify the time taken to complete one unit of work (in this case, cleaning one floor).
2. Adjust the time based on any changes (like injury or fatigue).
3. Calculate the total time required for the entire task (number of units × time per unit).
4. Convert the total time from minutes to hours if necessary.
5. Calculate the total working hours available (hours per day × number of days).
6. Use the formula to find the percentage of time spent on the task (time spent / total working hours × 100).

### Advice:
- Always verify the time taken for each unit of work, especially if there are changes in conditions.
- Break down the problem into clear steps to avoid confusion and ensure all calculations are accounted for.
- Keep track of total working hours and ensure you are using the correct units when calculating percentages.","--- Beginning of the template ---

Seeing how upset Gabriel was, his father gave him a pouch of beads with 7 beads inside. How many beads did Gabriel end up with?",67.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of beads**: Gabriel starts with 78 beads.

2. **Beads dropped**: He dropped one-third of the beads. To find out how many beads that is:
   \[
   \text{Beads dropped} = \frac{1}{3} \times 78 = 26

As the pot of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 90 pop in the first 22 seconds of cooking, then 3 times that amount in the next 22 seconds. The kernels increase to 4 times the initial popping rate in the next 22 seconds. In the final 22 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 22 seconds. After Alejandro takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. Alejandro gives 1/5 of the made popcorns to his brother Tariq. How many pieces of popcorn does Alejandro have to eat?",756.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First 22 seconds:**
   - Number of pops = 90

2. **Next 22 seconds:**
   - Number of pops = 3 times the initial amount = \(3 \times 90 = 270\)

3. **Next 22 seconds:**
   - Number of pops = 4 times the initial amount = \(4 \times 90 = 360\)

4. **Final 22 seconds:**
   - Number of pops = half the rate of the previous 22 seconds = \(\frac{360}{2} = 180\)

Now, let's calculate the total number of pops during the cooking process:

\[
\text{Total pops} = 90 + 270 + 360 + 180
\]

Calculating this step by step:

\[
90 + 270 = 360
\]
\[
360 + 360 = 720

\[
720 + 180 = 900

8. **Popcorn Alejandro has to eat:**
   - Total popcorn - Popcorn given to Tariq:

3. In the following 22 seconds, the popping rate increases to 4 times the initial rate:
   - 4 * 90 = 360 kernels.
4. In the final 22 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate of the previous 22 seconds:
   - Half of 360 = 180 kernels.
5. Now, we will calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the cooking:
   - Total popped = 90 + 270 + 360 + 180 = 900 kernels.
6. After cooking, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds also pop from the residual heat:
   - A quarter of 180 = 180 / 4 = 45 kernels.

If there are 40 cubes in the pyramid in total, what percentage of cubes are white?",40.0,"To find the percentage of white cubes in the pyramid, we first need to determine the total number of each type of cube.

1. **Identify the number of green cubes**: 
   - There are 4 green cubes.

2. **Identify the number of black cubes**: 
   - The number of black cubes is five times the number of green cubes. 
   - Therefore, the number of black cubes is:

Now, we can calculate the percentage of blueberry cupcakes out of the total cupcakes:

\[
\text{Percentage of blueberry cupcakes} = \left( \frac{\text{Blueberry cupcakes}}{\text{Total cupcakes}} \right) \times 100
\]
\[
\text{Percentage of blueberry cupcakes} = \left( \frac{4140}{6900} \right) \times 100
\]

Calculating the fraction:

\[
\frac{4140}{6900} \approx 0.6
\]

Now, converting this to a percentage:

\[
0.6 \times 100 = 60\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the cupcakes that are blueberry cupcakes is:

\[
\boxed{60\%}
\]",60.0,1,"Let's think step by step.  
The Smith family has made a total of 6900 cupcakes.  
They have made 1126 peanut butter cupcakes and 1634 lemon cupcakes.  

First, we need to find out how many blueberry cupcakes they have made.  
To do this, we subtract the number of peanut butter and lemon cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes:  
6900 - 1126 - 1634 = 6900 - 2760 = 4140.  

So, they have made 4140 blueberry cupcakes.  

Next, we need to find the percentage of the total cupcakes that are blueberry cupcakes.  
The formula for percentage is:  
(Part / Whole) * 100.  

In this case, the part is the number of blueberry cupcakes (4140) and the whole is the total number of cupcakes (6900).  

Now we can calculate the percentage:  
(4140 / 6900) * 100.  

Calculating this gives:  
4140 / 6900 ≈ 0.6.  
Now, multiplying by 100:  
0.6 * 100 = 60.  

The answer is 60%.",60.0,1,0,1,60.0,,,
