- **Volume:** I didn't properly adjust volumes after the spill and addition.
- **Proportion:** I didn't maintain the correct proportions of water and non-water components.
- **Percentage:** My final percentage calculation was based on an incorrect total volume and water content.

## Corrected Solution:

**1. Calculate the initial water content:**

* Mango drink water: 16 liters * (1/9) = 1.78 liters
* Apple drink water: 14 liters * (1/2) = 7 liters

**2. Adjust for the spilled mango drink:**

* Mango drink water remaining: 1.78 liters - 7 liters = -5.22 liters (This means the mango drink now has less water than initially calculated)

**3. Account for the added water:**

* Total water in the mixture: -5.22 liters + 7 liters + 7 liters = 8.78 liters

**4. Calculate the total volume of the final mixture:**

* Total volume: 16 liters - 7 liters + 7 liters = 16 liters

**5. Calculate the percentage of water:**

* Percentage of water: (8.78 liters / 16 liters) * 100% = 54.88%

Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answers

My previous answers were incorrect because I failed to accurately account for the spilled mango drink and the added water. I didn't properly adjust the volumes of each component throughout the mixing process. 

**Error Keywords:**

* **Volume:**  I didn't correctly track changes in volume due to spillage and water addition.
* **Concentration:** While I understood the concept of concentration, I didn't apply it consistently when calculating the final water content.
* **Proportion:** I didn't maintain accurate proportions of water and non-water components as the mixture changed.

## Corrected Solution

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Mango Drink:**
    * Initial volume: 16 liters
    * Water content: (1/9) * 16 liters = 1.78 liters
    * Mango content: 16 liters - 1.78 liters = 14.22 liters
    * Spilled volume: 7 liters
    * Remaining mango drink: 16 liters - 7 liters = 9 liters
    * Remaining mango content: 14.22 liters

2. **Apple Drink:**
    * Initial volume: 14 liters
    * Water content: (1/2) * 14 liters = 7 liters
    * Apple content: 14 liters - 7 liters = 7 liters

3. **Combined Mixture:**
    * Total volume: 9 liters + 14 liters = 23 liters
    * Total water content: 1.78 liters + 7 liters + 7 liters = 15.78 liters

4. **Final Percentage of Water:**
    * (15.78 liters / 23 liters) * 100% = **68.6%**



## Instructions for Future Problems

1. **Clearly define the initial volumes and concentrations of each component.**
2. **Carefully track changes in volume due to additions, removals, or spills.**
3. **Calculate the amount of solute (e.g., mango, apple) that remains constant throughout the process.**
4. **Adjust the concentrations accordingly after each change in volume.**
5. **Calculate the final volume and the total amount of solute present.**
6. **Determine the final concentration as a percentage.**

## General Advice

* **Visualize the process:** Draw diagrams or use containers to represent the mixtures and their changes.
* **Double-check your calculations:**  Mistakes in volume or concentration can lead to significant errors.
* **Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.**
* **Pay attention to units:** Ensure consistency in units throughout the solution.
* **Practice regularly:** The more you practice, the better you'll become at identifying and avoiding common pitfalls.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

If he watched 24 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 15.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

**Explanation:** My previous answer was incorrect because I didn't accurately calculate the total TV time spent on each day and then sum them up to find the total time. I likely made a mistake in adding up the time spent watching different shows on different days.

**Error Keywords:**

- Time
- Calculation
- Addition
- Units

**Solution:**

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Saturday & Sunday:** 4 hours/episode * 2 episodes/day * 2 days = 16 hours
2. **Monday:** Let 'x' be the number of 15-minute episodes watched. Total time on Monday = x * 15 minutes = 0.25x hours
3. **Tuesday:** 3 hours + 0.75 hours = 3.75 hours
4. **Wednesday:** 5 hours/episode * 2 episodes = 10 hours
5. **Thursday:** 4 episodes * 0.25 hours/episode = 1 hour
6. **Total TV Time:** 16 hours + 0.25x hours + 3.75 hours + 10 hours + 1 hour = 30.75 + 0.25x hours
7. **Equate Total Time:** 30.75 + 0.25x = 24 hours
8. **Solve for x:** 0.25x = -6.75
   x = -27

Since we can't have a negative number of episodes, there must be an error in the problem setup or the given information. 



**Instructions for Future Problems:**

1. **Identify all time units:** List all the time units used in the problem (e.g., hours, minutes, days).
2. **Convert all units to a common unit:** Choose one unit (e.g., hours) and convert all other units to that unit.
3. **Break down the problem:** Divide the problem into smaller steps, focusing on the time spent on each activity.
4. **Calculate time for each activity:** Use the given information to calculate the time spent on each activity in the chosen unit.
5. **Add up the times:** Sum the time spent on all activities to find the total time.
6. **Check for consistency:** Ensure that the total time calculated aligns with the given information in the problem.

**General Advice:**

- **Read the problem carefully:** Understand the context and identify the key information.
- **Draw a diagram or timeline:** Visualizing the problem can help with understanding the sequence of events and time durations.
- **Double-check your calculations:** Pay attention to units and ensure accuracy in addition and subtraction.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Fatima makes coffee using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 63:14. She also uses 9 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water. If she used a total of 760 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 760.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

**Explanation:**

My previous answer of 760 was incorrect because I failed to understand the problem's structure. I treated the total amount (760) as the amount of sugar without considering the ratios involving water and milk. I also didn't properly utilize the given information about the relationships between the ingredients.

**Error Keywords:**

- Misinterpretation
- Neglecting Ratios
- Incorrect Assumption

**Solution:**

Here's the correct step-by-step solution:

1. **Sugar-Water Ratio:** Fatima uses a ratio of 63:14 for sugar to water. This means for every 63 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 14 cups of water.

2. **Finding Sugar Proportion:** We know she used 760 total teaspoons of sugar, water, and milk.  Let's represent the unknown number of cups of water as 'x'.  We can set up a proportion:

   63/14 = 760/x

3. **Solving for Water:** Cross-multiply and solve for x:

   63x = 14 * 760
   63x = 10640
   x = 10640 / 63
   x ≈ 168.89 cups of water

4. **Milk-Water Ratio:** Fatima uses 9 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water.

5. **Finding Milk Amount:**  Calculate the amount of milk used:

   (9 tablespoons / 7 cups) * 168.89 cups ≈ 226.27 tablespoons of milk

6. **Total Sugar:**  We know Fatima used 760 total teaspoons of sugar, water, and milk.  Since we've calculated the water and milk amounts, we can subtract them to find the sugar amount:

   760 - (168.89 cups * 14 teaspoons/cup) - 226.27 tablespoons * (1 teaspoon/tablespoon) ≈ 760 - 2364.46 - 226.27 ≈ -1830.73

**Important Note:** The result is negative, indicating an error in the problem setup or the given information. It's impossible to have a negative amount of sugar.



**Instructions for Future Problems:**

1. **Carefully Read:**  Read the entire problem multiple times to understand the relationships between ingredients and quantities.
2. **Identify Ratios:**  Clearly identify all given ratios and proportions.

[Example Input]
Question: A bakery uses a ratio of 3 cups of flour to 2 cups of sugar for its cookies. If they use 15 cups of flour, how many cups of sugar will they need?
Wrong answer: 10 cups of sugar. The bakery needs 10 cups of sugar because 3:2 is the same as 15:10.
---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the ratio directly translates to multiplying the flour amount by a proportional factor. I didn't account for the need to find the scaling factor based on the given flour amount.
Error Keywords:
- Ratio
- Proportion
- Scaling factor
Instructions:
1. Identify the given ratio.
2. Determine the scaling factor needed to reach the given amount of one ingredient.
3. Multiply the other ingredient's value in the ratio by the scaling factor.
Advice:
- Always remember that ratios represent a fixed proportion, not a direct multiplication.
- When scaling a ratio, find the scaling factor based on the given amount of one ingredient.
- Double-check your calculations to ensure the proportions are maintained.
Solution:
The bakery needs 10 cups of sugar. Here's the solution:
1. The ratio is 3:2 (flour:sugar).
2. The scaling factor is 15 cups of flour / 3 cups of flour = 5.
3. Multiply the sugar value in the ratio by the scaling factor: 2 cups of sugar * 5 = 10 cups of sugar.

* Discount amount = 10% of $500,000 = (10/100) * $500,000 = $50,000

**2. Calculate the price after the discount:**

* Discounted price = Selling price - Discount amount 
* Discounted price = $500,000 - $50,000 = $450,000

**3. Calculate the brokerage fee:**

* Brokerage fee = 4% of $500,000 = (4/100) * $500,000 = $20,000

**4. Calculate the transfer fee:**

* Transfer fee = 13% of $500,000 = (13/100) * $500,000 = $65,000

**5. Calculate the total cost:**

* Total cost = Discounted price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
* Total cost = $450,000 + $20,000 + $65,000 = $535,000

**6. Calculate the difference between the total cost and Ms. Johnson's budget:**

* Difference = Total cost - Ms. Johnson's budget

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answer of 3.0 was incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the total cost of the party and then determine the remaining budget for inviting friends. I likely made a mistake in either adding up the individual costs or in subtracting the total cost from the budget. 

**Error Keywords:**

- Calculation
- Budgeting
- Cost Allocation

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Calculate the cost of laser tag:** 
   - Assuming Emma also plays laser tag, that's 1 round * €6/round = €6.

2. **Calculate the cost of roller coaster rides:**
   - 3 rides * €10/ride = €30.

3. **Calculate the total cost of activities:**
   - €6 (laser tag) + €4 (pinball) + €30 (roller coaster) = €40.

4. **Calculate the total party cost:**
   - €40 (activities) + €60 (bus) = €100.

5. **Calculate the remaining budget for friends:**
   - €180 (budget) - €100 (total cost) = €80.

6. **Determine the number of friends Emma can invite:**
   - Assuming each friend also plays laser tag, pinball, and rides the roller coaster, the cost per friend is €40.
   - €80 (remaining budget) / €40 (cost per friend) = 2 friends.



## Instructions for Future Problems:

1. **Identify all costs:** List every expense related to the problem.
2. **Calculate individual costs:** Determine the price of each item or service.
3. **Sum up costs:** Add all individual costs to find the total cost.

- **Missing Information:** I overlooked the contribution of sugar calories. 
- **Incomplete Calculation:** I didn't include all components of the calorie intake. 

## Solution: 

1. **Soda Calories:** 7 mL/bottle * 6 calories/mL * 3 bottles = 126 calories 
2. **Sugar Calories:** 3 teaspoons/bottle * 6 calories/teaspoon * 3 bottles = 54 calories
3. **Total Calories:** 126 calories + 54 calories = 180 calories 


## Instructions: 

1. **Identify all calorie sources:** Carefully examine the problem for all sources of calories mentioned. 
2. **Calculate calories from each source:** Determine the calorie contribution of each source separately. 
3. **Sum the calorie contributions:** Add up the calories from all sources to obtain the total calorie intake.

My previous answer of 511.0 was incorrect because I failed to accurately track the changes in the number of pineapples and kiwis throughout the problem. I likely made several calculation errors and didn't properly account for the multiple steps involved. 

**Error Keywords:**

* **Multiplication:** I likely misapplied multiplication when calculating the initial number of pineapples and when calculating the later purchases.
* **Subtraction:** I may have made errors when subtracting the number of pineapples and kiwis in different scenarios.
* **Addition:**  I likely added quantities incorrectly, especially when combining the initial amounts with the purchases. 
* **Quantity Relationships:** I struggled to maintain a clear understanding of the relationships between the number of pineapples and kiwis at each stage. 

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Initial Pineapples:** Theo has 8 * 25 kiwis = 200 pineapples.

2. **Kiwis After Purchase:** Theo has 25 kiwis + 63 kiwis = 88 kiwis.

3. **Pineapples After Purchase:** Theo has 200 pineapples - 19 kiwis = 181 pineapples.

4. **Kiwis After Second Purchase:** Theo buys 2 * 88 kiwis - 22 kiwis = 154 kiwis.

5. **Pineapples After Second Purchase:** Theo buys 181 pineapples + 13 pineapples = 194 pineapples.

6. **Total Pineapples:** Theo has 194 pineapples.

7. **Total Kiwis:** Theo has 154 kiwis.

8. **Combined Total:** Theo has 194 pineapples + 154 kiwis = 348 pineapples and kiwis.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer

My previous answers were incorrect because I struggled to keep track of the changing quantities of pineapples and kiwis throughout the problem. I made several arithmetic errors and didn't accurately represent the relationships between the fruits at each stage. 

**Keywords Describing Errors:**

* **Changing quantities:**  The problem involves multiple additions and subtractions that alter the initial amounts.
* **Multiplication:**  The initial relationship between pineapples and kiwis is based on multiplication.
* **Comparison:**  Several parts of the problem involve comparisons (e.g., ""fewer than,"" ""twice as many"").

## Corrected Solution

**Step 1: Calculate the initial number of pineapples.**

* Theo has 8 times as many pineapples as kiwis, and he has 25 kiwis.
* Initial pineapples = 8 * 25 = 200 pineapples

**Step 2: Calculate the number of kiwis after the first purchase.**

* Theo buys 63 more kiwis.
* New kiwi count = 25 + 63 = 88 kiwis

**Step 3: Calculate the number of pineapples after the second purchase.**

* Theo buys 13 pineapples.
* New pineapple count = 200 + 13 = 213 pineapples

**Step 4: Calculate the number of pineapples Theo has after subtracting.**

* Theo buys 19 fewer pineapples than the number of kiwis.
* Pineapples after subtraction = 88 - 19 = 69 pineapples. 

**Step 5: Calculate the number of kiwis Theo buys in the third purchase.**

* Theo buys 22 fewer than twice the number of kiwis.
* Twice the kiwis = 88 * 2 = 176 kiwis
* Kiwis bought = 176 - 22 = 154 kiwis.

**Step 6: Calculate the total number of kiwis.**

* Total kiwis = 88 + 154 = 242 kiwis.

**Step 7: Calculate the total number of pineapples.**

* Total pineapples = 69 pineapples. 

**Step 8: Calculate the total number of pineapples and kiwis.**

* Total fruits = 242 kiwis + 69 pineapples = 311 fruits.

   -  The sale price is $23 per kg for the first 16 kgs, so that's 16 * $23 = $368.
   -  The remaining 23 - 16 = 7 kgs are half price, so they cost 7 * ($23 / 2) = $7.75.
   -  The total cost of the taffy is $368 + $7.75 = $375.75

2. **Calculate the cost of the keychains:**
   -  Ananya bought 17 keychains at $20 each, so they cost 17 * $20 = $340.

3. **Calculate the total spending:**
   -  The taffy cost $375.75, the starfish $11, and the keychains $340, for a total of $375.75 + $11 + $340 = $726.75

4. **Calculate the remaining money:**
   -  Ananya started with $1200 and spent $726.75, leaving her with $1200 - $726.75 = $473.25

5. **Account for the donation:**

","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer

My initial answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in calculating the cost of the taffy. I incorrectly calculated the cost of the discounted taffy and added it to the cost of the full-priced taffy. This resulted in an inaccurate total spending amount, leading to an incorrect final amount of money Ananya had left.

**Error Keywords:**

- Calculation error
- Arithmetic error
- Discount calculation error

## Corrected Solution

1. **Calculate the cost of the taffy:**
   - Ananya bought 16 kgs of taffy at full price: 16 * $23 = $368
   - Ananya bought 7 kgs of taffy at half price: 7 * ($23 / 2) = $8.05
   - Total cost of taffy: $368 + $8.05 = $376.05

2. **Calculate the cost of the keychains:**
   - 17 keychains * $20/keychain = $340

3. **Calculate the total spending:**
   - Taffy: $376.05
   - Starfish: $11
   - Keychains: $340
   - Total spending: $376.05 + $11 + $340 = $727.05

4. **Calculate the remaining money:**
   - Starting money: $1200
   - Spending: $727.05
   - Remaining money: $1200 - $727.05 = $472.95

5. **Account for the donation:**
   - Remaining money: $472.95
   - Donation: $5
   - Final amount: $472.95 - $5 = $467.95



**The answer is $467.95**

**Explanation:** 

I incorrectly calculated the price of the taffy. I failed to apply the discount correctly, treating the entire 23 kg purchase as if it were at the regular price. 

**Error Keywords:** 

- Discount 
- Unit price 
- Quantity 

**Solution:**

1. **Taffy Calculation:** 
    - 23 kg taffy divided into 16 kg and 7 kg portions. 
    - 16 kg taffy cost: 16 kg * $23/kg = $368.00
    - Discount on 7 kg taffy: 7 kg * ($23/kg * 0.5) = $8.05 
    - 7 kg taffy cost: 7 kg * $23/kg - $8.05 = $141.95
    - Total taffy cost: $368.00 + $141.95 = $509.95

2. **Total Expenses:**
    - Total expenses: $509.95 (taffy) + $11.00 (starfish) + ($20.00/keychain * 17 keychains) = $509.95 + $11.00 + $340.00 = $860.95

3. **Remaining Money:**
    - Money remaining: $1200.00 (starting amount) - $860.95 (expenses) - $5.00 (donation) = $334.05 



**Instructions:** 

1. **Identify Discount Structure:** Carefully analyze the discount terms. Determine if it's a percentage discount, a fixed amount discount, or a ""buy-X-get-Y-discount"" structure. 
2. **Break Down Purchases:** Divide purchases with discounts into separate quantities that apply to the discount. 
3. **Calculate Individual Discounts:** Apply the discount to each portion separately. 
4. **Calculate Individual Prices:** Subtract the discount from the original price for each portion. 
5. **Calculate Total Costs:** Add up the prices of all items, including discounted items. 

**Advice:** 

- **Read Carefully:** Pay close attention to the wording of discounts and promotions. 
- **Visual Aids:** Use diagrams or lists to organize calculations, especially when dealing with multiple items and discounts. 
- **Double-Check:** Always double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with decimals and percentages. 
- **Practice:** Regularly practice solving problems involving discounts and multiple items to improve accuracy.

How much money does Ananya have left?",361.0,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the cost of the taffy:**

*  Ananya bought 23 kgs of taffy, which is more than the 16 kgs needed for the discount.
*  The discount applies to 4 kgs at half price: 4 kgs * ($23/kg / 2) = $46
*  The cost of the remaining taffy is: (23 kgs - 4 kgs) * $23/kg = 19 kgs * $23/kg = $437
*  The total cost of the taffy is: $437 + $46 = $483

**2. Calculate the cost of the keychains:**

*  17 keychains * $20.00/keychain = $340.00

**3. Calculate Ananya's total spending:**

*  $483 (taffy) + $11.00 (starfish) + $340.00 (keychains) + $5.00 (donation) = $849.00

**4. Calculate Ananya's remaining money:**

*  $1200.00 (starting money) - $849.00 (spending) = $351.00



**Answer:** Ananya has $351.00 left.",351.0,0,"A: Let's think step by step...

1. **Calculate the cost of the taffy:**
   -  Ananya bought 23 kgs of taffy.
   -  The sale price is $23 per kg for the first 16 kgs, so that's 16 * $23 = $368.
   -  The remaining 23 - 16 = 7 kgs are half price, so they cost 7 * ($23 / 2) = $7.75.
   -  The total cost of the taffy is $368 + $7.75 = $375.75

2. **Calculate the cost of the keychains:**
   -  Ananya bought 17 keychains at $20 each, so they cost 17 * $20 = $340.

3. **Calculate the total spending:**
   -  The taffy cost $375.75, the starfish $11, and the keychains $340, for a total of $375.75 + $11 + $340 = $726.75

4. **Calculate the remaining money:**
   -  Ananya started with $1200 and spent $726.75, leaving her with $1200 - $726.75 = $473.25

5. **Account for the donation:**
   -  Ananya donated $5, so her final amount is $473.25 - $5 = $468.25

Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer

My previous answers were incorrect due to a combination of errors:

* **Incorrect Discount Calculation:** I struggled to accurately apply the ""Buy 16 kgs at $23 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/2 off"" discount. 
* **Miscalculation of Individual Item Costs:** I made mistakes when calculating the cost of the keychains and the discounted taffy.
* **Incorrect Total Calculation:** I failed to accurately sum up all the expenses and subtract them from Ananya's starting amount.

**Error Keywords:**

* **Discount:**  Specifically, applying a tiered discount.
* **Unit Pricing:**  Misunderstanding the price per kg for the taffy.
* **Total Calculation:**  Inaccurate addition and subtraction.

## Corrected Solution

Here's a step-by-step solution with corrections:

1. **Taffy Cost:**
    * 16 kgs at $23/kg = 16 * $23 = $368
    * 4 kgs at half price = 4 * ($23 / 2) = $46
    * Total taffy cost = $368 + $46 = $414

2. **Keychain Cost:**
    * 17 keychains * $20/keychain = $340

3. **Total Expenses:**
    * Taffy: $414
    * Starfish: $11
    * Keychains: $340
    * Charity Donation: $5
    * Total Expenses = $414 + $11 + $340 + $5 = $770

4. **Remaining Money:**
    * Starting Money: $1200
    * Total Expenses: $770
    * Remaining Money = $1200 - $770 = $430


## Instructions for Future Problems

1. **Identify Discount Structure:** Carefully read the discount information to understand how it applies (percentage, buy-one-get-one, tiered discounts, etc.).
2. **Break Down Costs:** Calculate the cost of each item individually, applying discounts as needed.
3. **Use Unit Pricing:**  If applicable, convert prices per unit (e.g., per kg, per item) to calculate the total cost.
4. **Double-Check Calculations:**  Carefully review each step of your calculations to avoid errors in addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
5. **Sum All Expenses:**  Add up the cost of all items and any other expenses.
6. **Subtract Expenses from Starting Amount:**  Calculate the remaining money by subtracting total expenses from the initial amount.

## General Advice

* **Read Carefully:**  Pay close attention to all details in the problem.
* **Visualize:**  Try to create a mental picture of the situation to better understand the relationships between items and costs.
* **Break It Down:**  Divide complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.
* **Check Your Work:**  Always review your calculations and make sure they make sense in the context of the problem.
* **Practice:**  The more you practice solving these types of problems, the better you will become at identifying potential errors and applying the correct strategies.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

Andre spent $100 and got 4 bags of crackers, 7 packs of pretzels, and had 3% of his money left in change. How many gum did he buy?",45.0,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the cost of the crackers:**

* Cost of one bag of crackers: $0.75
* Cost of 4 bags of crackers: $0.75 * 4 = $3.00

**2. Calculate the cost of the pretzels:**

* Cost of one pack of pretzels: $7.00
* Cost of 7 packs of pretzels: $7.00 * 7 = $49.00

**3. Calculate how much money Andre spent:**

*  Let 'x' be the number of gum packs Andre bought.
* Total cost of gum: $1.00 * x = $x
* Total spent: $3.00 + $49.00 + $x = $52.00 + $x

**4. Calculate how much money Andre had left:**

* Change: 3% of $100 = (3/100) * $100 = $3.00
* Money spent: $100 - $3.00 = $97.00

**5. Set up an equation and solve for x:**

* We know the total spent was $97.00: $52.00 + $x = $97.00
* Subtract $52.00 from both sides: $x = $45.00

**6. Find the number of gum packs:**

* Since each pack of gum costs $1.00, Andre bought $45.00 / $1.00 = 45 packs of gum.



**Answer:** Andre bought 45 packs of gum.",45.0,1,"A: Let's think step by step...

1. **Calculate the cost of the crackers:** 4 bags of crackers * $0.75/bag = $3.00

Reflection 1: 34.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

**Explanation:**

My previous answers were incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the number of red cards and then the number of purple cards. I likely made a calculation error when determining the increase in red cards and didn't correctly add all the cards together to find the total.

**Error Keywords:**

- Calculation error
-  Word problem comprehension
-  Percentage calculation

**Corrected Solution:**

1. **Calculate the number of red cards:** 
   - 70% of 30 pink cards is (70/100) * 30 = 21 red cards.
   - Total red cards: 30 pink cards + 21 red cards = 51 red cards.

2. **Calculate the number of purple cards:**
   - Purple cards are equal to the sum of pink and red cards: 30 + 51 = 81 purple cards.

3. **Calculate the total number of cards:**
   - Total cards: 30 pink + 51 red + 81 purple = 162 cards.

4. **Calculate the average number of cards per color:**
   - Average cards per color: 162 cards / 3 colors = 54 cards per color.



**Instructions for Future Attempts:**

1. **Read the problem carefully:**  Ensure you understand the relationships between the different types of cards.
2. **Break down the problem:** Calculate the number of red cards first, then the purple cards.
3. **Use the correct percentage formula:**  Remember that percentage means ""out of one hundred,"" so divide the percentage by 100 before multiplying.
4. **Double-check calculations:**  Carefully verify each step to avoid errors.

**General Advice for Similar Problems:**

- **Identify key information:**  Focus on the relationships and quantities described in the problem.
- **Visualize the problem:**  Draw a diagram or use other visual aids to represent the information.
- **Work systematically:**  Follow a logical order of operations to avoid confusion.
- **Review your answer:**  Make sure your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer

**Explanation:** My previous answers were incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the swimming time in warm water and then compare it to the cold water time for the given distances. I likely made a mistake in either the calculation of the warm water time or the comparison of the total times.

**Error Keywords:**

- **Time Calculation:**  I struggled with accurately calculating the time taken for swimming in warm water.
- **Distance Scaling:** I didn't correctly scale the time difference for swimming a kilometer in warm water to the longer distances.
- **Comparison:** I made an error when comparing the total times for swimming 7 kilometers in warm water and 9 kilometers in cold water.

**Corrected Solution:**

1. **Warm Water Time:**
    - Four times the time in cold water is 4 * 11 minutes = 44 minutes.
    - Warm water time is 9 minutes more than that: 44 minutes + 9 minutes = 53 minutes per kilometer.

2. **Warm Water Total Time:**
    - Time for 7 kilometers in warm water: 53 minutes/kilometer * 7 kilometers = 371 minutes.

3. **Cold Water Total Time:**
    - Time for 9 kilometers in cold water: 11 minutes/kilometer * 9 kilometers = 99 minutes.

4. **Difference:**
    - Difference in time: 371 minutes - 99 minutes = 272 minutes.

5. **Convert to Hours:**
    - 272 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4.53 hours.



**Instructions for Future Problems:**

1. **Identify Key Information:** Carefully read the problem and identify the relevant distances, times, and rates.
2. **Define Variables:** Assign variables to represent the unknown quantities.
3. **Set Up Equations:**  Formulate equations based on the given information and the relationships between distance, time, and rate.
4. **Solve Equations:** Solve the equations step-by-step to find the unknown variables.
5. **Check Units:** Ensure that the units of measurement are consistent throughout the solution.
6. **Interpret Results:**  Clearly state the answer in the context of the problem.

**General Advice:**

p1,gsm-symbolic,google/gemma-2-9b-it,"Santiago goes to the store to buy some flour. The normal brand of flour he buys costs ₣10 per kilogram. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 40% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of flour and he uses 3 kilograms of flour per day. He also decided to buy himself a bagel for ₣4. Since he shopped more than ₣50, he received a ₣23 discount. How much does Santiago have to pay?",275.0,"Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the price of the more expensive flour:**

* The more expensive flour costs 40% more than the normal price: 10 * 0.40 = 4 extra francs
* The new price of the flour is: 10 + 4 = ₣14 per kilogram

**2. Calculate the total flour needed for the week:**

* Santiago uses 3 kilograms of flour per day: 3 * 7 = 21 kilograms

**3. Calculate the total cost of the flour:**

* The total cost of the flour is: 21 * 14 = ₣294

**4. Calculate the total cost before the discount:**

* The total cost before the discount is: 294 + 4 = ₣298

**5. Calculate the final price:**

* Subtract the discount from the total cost: 298 - 23 = ₣275



**Answer:** Santiago has to pay ₣275.",275.0,1,"A: Let's think step by step...

1. **Calculate the price increase:** The more expensive flour costs 40% more than ₣10, so the increase is 0.40 * ₣10 = ₣4.

2. **Calculate the price of the expensive flour:** The new price is ₣10 + ₣4 = ₣14 per kilogram.

3. **Calculate the total flour needed for the week:** Santiago uses 3 kilograms per day for 7 days, so he needs 3 * 7 = 21 kilograms of flour.

4. **Calculate the total cost of the flour:** The flour costs ₣14 per kilogram, so 21 kilograms cost 21 * ₣14 = ₣294.

5. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:** Including the bagel, the total cost is ₣294 + ₣4 = ₣298.

4. **Calculate the percentage of green spools:** (44 green spools / 540 total spools) * 100% = 8.15% (approximately).


The answer is approximately 8.15%.
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answer was incorrect because I made a significant error in calculating the total number of magenta spools. I mistakenly multiplied the number of green spools by 10 instead of calculating the total number of green spools first. This led to an inaccurate calculation of the total number of spools and ultimately an incorrect percentage.

**Error Keywords:**

- Calculation error
- Misinterpretation of instructions
- Incorrect application of multiplication

## Corrected Solution:

1. **Calculate the total number of green spools:** 17 light green + 27 dark green = 44 green spools.

2. **Calculate the total number of magenta spools:** 44 green spools * 10 = 440 magenta spools.

3. **Calculate the total number of spools:** 44 green + 49 light black + 17 dark black + 440 magenta = 550 spools in total.

4. **Calculate the percentage of green spools:** (44 green spools / 550 total spools) * 100% = 8% (approximately).

I incorrectly calculated the percentage of green spools. 

**Error Keywords:** 

- Percentage 
- Addition 
- Division 
- Whole 

**Explanation:** 

I failed to accurately calculate the total number of spools Emma owns. I likely added the green spools together and divided by the total, missing the crucial step of calculating the total number of spools, including the magenta ones. 

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total number of green spools:** 17 (light green) + 27 (dark green) = 44 green spools.
2. **Calculate the number of magenta spools:** 44 (green spools) * 10 = 440 magenta spools.
3. **Calculate the total number of spools:** 44 (green) + 49 (light black) + 17 (dark black) + 440 (magenta) = 550 spools.
4. **Calculate the percentage of green spools:** (44 / 550) * 100 = 8% 


**Instructions:** 

1. **Identify all categories:** Clearly list all types of spools Emma owns. 
2. **Calculate totals:** Add up the spools within each category. 
3. **Calculate the grand total:** Add up all the spool categories to find the total number of spools. 
4. **Apply the percentage formula:** Divide the total number of a specific category by the grand total and multiply by 100. 

**Advice:** 

- Always ensure you're calculating the percentage relative to the *entire* dataset, not just a subset. 
- Double-check your calculations at each step to avoid accumulating errors. 
- Pay close attention to keywords like ""total"" and ""all"" to ensure you're considering the entire scope of the problem.

p1,gsm-symbolic,google/gemma-2-9b-it,"Yuki is raising money for a music festival. He has applied for help from the youth club, which has decided to cover a tenth of the cost of the music festival. His friends have also chipped in and will cover 1/2 of the music festival. How much money is Yuki missing if he has ¥15 and the music festival costs ¥490?",181.0,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the youth club's contribution:**

* A tenth of the festival cost is ¥490 / 10 = ¥49

**2. Calculate the friends' contribution:**

* Half the festival cost is ¥490 / 2 = ¥245

**3. Calculate the total amount contributed so far:**

*  The youth club and friends contributed a total of ¥49 + ¥245 = ¥294

**4. Calculate how much more money Yuki needs:**

* Yuki needs ¥490 - ¥294 = ¥196 more.


**Answer:** Yuki is missing ¥196.",196.0,0,"A: Let's think step by step...

1. **Calculate the amount covered by the youth club:** A tenth of ¥490 is ¥490 / 10 = ¥49.

2. **Calculate the amount covered by Yuki's friends:** Half of ¥490 is ¥490 / 2 = ¥245.

3. **Calculate the total amount covered by the youth club and friends:** ¥49 + ¥245 = ¥294.

4. **Calculate the amount Yuki is still missing:** The total cost of the festival is ¥490, and ¥294 has already been covered, so Yuki is still missing ¥490 - ¥294 = ¥196.

5. **Add Yuki's ¥15 to the missing amount:** Yuki is still missing ¥196 + ¥15 = ¥211.

**Explanation:** 

I failed to accurately calculate the grain needed for each alpaca and cow. I likely made a mistake in applying the given relationships between the animals' grain requirements. 

**Error Keywords:**

- Calculation
- Units
- Word Problem Interpretation 
- Algebraic Reasoning 

**Solution:**

1. **Alpaca Grain:** 
    - Goats eat 9 kg: 9 kg * 2 = 18 kg (twice the goat's amount)
    - Alpaca eat 3 kg less than twice the goat's amount: 18 kg - 3 kg = 15 kg/alpaca

2. **Cow Grain:**
    - Goat grain: 9 kg
    - Alpaca grain: 15 kg
    - Cow grain: 9 kg + 15 kg = 24 kg/cow

3. **Total Grain:**
    - Goat grain: 21 goats * 9 kg/goat = 189 kg
    - Alpaca grain: 7 alpacas * 15 kg/alpaca = 105 kg
    - Cow grain: 21 cows * 24 kg/cow = 504 kg
    - Total grain: 189 kg + 105 kg + 504 kg = **808 kg** 



**Instructions:**

1. **Identify individual needs:** Clearly define the grain requirement for each animal type.
2. **Break down complex relationships:** Deconstruct word phrases describing grain needs into simpler calculations. 
3. **Use variables:** Consider using variables to represent unknown quantities, especially when dealing with multiple steps. 
4. **Double-check units:** Ensure consistent units throughout the calculation. 
5. **Calculate totals:** Sum the grain needed for each animal type to find the overall requirement. 

**General Advice:**

- **Read carefully:** Pay close attention to the wording of the problem to avoid misunderstandings. 
- **Visualize:** Try to draw a diagram or picture to represent the situation, which can aid in understanding relationships. 
- **Check for reasonableness:** After calculating, assess if the answer makes sense in the context of the problem. 
- **Practice:** Regularly solving word problems will improve your ability to identify patterns and apply appropriate strategies.

If the cupcake cost ₺10 and the orange pie cost ₺22, how much was Andre's average daily earning?",980.0,"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate Tuesday's cupcake sales:**

* Tuesday's cupcake sales = Monday's cupcake sales + 11 boxes
* Tuesday's cupcake sales = 24 boxes + 11 boxes = 35 boxes

**2. Calculate Monday's orange pie sales:**

* Monday's orange pie sales = Tuesday's orange pie sales - 16 boxes
* Monday's orange pie sales = 28 boxes - 16 boxes = 12 boxes

**3. Calculate Wednesday's sales:**

* Wednesday's total sales = Monday's total sales + Tuesday's total sales
* Wednesday's cupcake sales = 24 boxes + 35 boxes = 59 boxes
* Wednesday's orange pie sales = 12 boxes + 28 boxes = 40 boxes

* Monday's earnings = (24 boxes * ₺10) + (12 boxes * ₺22) = ₺240 + ₺264 = ₺504
* Tuesday's earnings = (35 boxes * ₺10) + (28 boxes * ₺22) = ₺350 + ₺616 = ₺966
* Wednesday's earnings = (59 boxes * ₺10) + (40 boxes * ₺22) = ₺590 + ₺880 = ₺1470

**1. Calculate the total space needed:**

* Mei needs 13 feet of space between each plant, and her plants are 3 feet wide. So, each plant takes up 13 + 3 = 16 feet of space.

**2. Determine the number of plants needed:**

* Divide the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant takes up: 143 feet / 16 feet/plant = 8.9375 plants.
* Since Mei can't buy parts of plants, she needs to buy 9 plants.

**3. Calculate the number of plants to buy:**

* Mei already owns 8 plants, so she needs to buy 9 - 8 = 1 more plant.

**4. Calculate the cost before the discount:**

* The cost of one plant is €9, so one more plant will cost €9.

**5. Calculate the final cost:**

* Since Mei is buying more than 2 plants, she gets a €5 discount.
* The final cost is €9 - €5 = €4.


**Answer:** Mei will spend €4 at the store.",4.0,0,"A: Let's think step by step to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the number of spaces for plants:**

*  Mei needs 13 feet of space between each plant, including the plant's width.
*  The total space needed for one plant and the space between it and the next is 3 feet (plant width) + 13 feet (space) = 16 feet.
*  Divide the total length of the flower bed by the space needed per plant: 143 feet / 16 feet/plant = 8.9375. Since Mei can't have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 8 plants.

**2. Calculate the number of plants Mei needs to buy:**

*  Mei already owns 8 plants.
*  She needs 8 more plants to fill the flower bed.

**3. Calculate the total cost before the discount:**

*  Each plant costs €9.
*  The total cost of 8 plants is 8 * €9 = €72.

**4. Apply the discount:**

*  Mei is buying more than 2 plants, so she gets a €5 discount.
*  The final price is €72 - €5 = €67.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

My previous answer of 11.0 hours was incorrect because I failed to account for all the time components involved in Santiago's learning activities.  I missed calculating the preparation time for each extra class and the extra learning time on the weekend. 

**Error Keywords:**

* **Time calculation:**  I didn't accurately sum all the time spent.
* **Unit conversion:** I likely didn't consistently convert minutes to hours.
* **Missed steps:** I overlooked the preparation time and weekend learning.

## Corrected Solution:

**1. Calculate extra class time:**

* Santiago takes 3 extra classes * 30 minutes/class = 90 minutes of class time.
* He spends 3 extra classes * 15 minutes/class = 45 minutes preparing for each class.

**2. Calculate total weekly extra class time:**

* Total preparation time: 45 minutes/class * 3 classes = 135 minutes
* Total class time: 90 minutes/day * 4 days/week = 360 minutes
* Total extra class time: 135 minutes + 360 minutes = 495 minutes

**3. Convert extra class time to hours:**

* 495 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8.25 hours

**4. Calculate weekend learning time:**

* Weekly extra class time: 8.25 hours
* Weekend learning time: 8.25 hours / 9 = 0.92 hours

**5. Calculate total weekly learning time:**

* Total weekly learning time: 8.25 hours + 0.92 hours = 9.17 hours



## Instructions for Future Problems:

1. **Identify all time components:** Carefully read the problem and list every time element involved (e.g., class time, preparation, additional learning).
2. **Break down complex tasks:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
3. **Calculate time for each component:** Use the given information to calculate the time spent on each component separately.
4. **Convert units:** Ensure all time units are consistent (e.g., minutes to hours) before adding them together.
5. **Sum all time components:** Add up the time spent on each component to find the total time.

## General Advice:

* **Read carefully:** Pay close attention to all details and keywords in the problem.
* **Visualize the process:**  Draw a diagram or timeline to help visualize the different time components.
* **Double-check your work:**  Review your calculations and ensure all units are consistent.

* Olivia walks four times faster on the sidewalk than on the beach. Let's represent her beach walking speed as 'x'.
* Her sidewalk walking speed is then '4x'.

**2.  Speed Reduction:**

* Her speed on both the beach and sidewalk has decreased by half due to her injury.
* New beach walking speed: x/2
* New sidewalk walking speed: 4x/2 = 2x

**3.  Time on the Beach:**

* We know Olivia spends 60 minutes walking on the beach.

**4.  Distance on the Beach:**

*  Distance = Speed x Time
*  Distance on the beach = (x/2) * 60 = 30x

**5.  Distance on the Sidewalk:**

*  Distance on the sidewalk = 20 km - 30x 

**6.  Time on the Sidewalk:**

*  Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed
*  Time on the sidewalk = (20 km - 30x) / 2x

**7.  Total Time:**

*  Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk
*  Total time = 60 + (20 km - 30x) / 2x

**8.  Finding 'x':**

* To find the total time, we need to find the value of 'x'.  We can use the fact that the total distance is 20 km.
* 30x + (20 km - 30x) = 20 km 
* This equation simplifies, and we can solve for 'x'.

**9.  Calculate Total Time:**

* Once we have the value of 'x', substitute it back into the total time equation to get the final answer in minutes.



Let me know if you'd like me to work through the solution for 'x' and the final calculation of the total time.",9.0,0,2.0,1.0,75.0,"--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

Now, look at this question:
Question: Olivia walks 20 kilometers every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 kilometers of walking on the beach and 10 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer

**Explanation:** My initial answer of 9.0 minutes was far too low and demonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem. I failed to:

* **Accurately determine Olivia's speeds on both the beach and sidewalk:** I didn't account for the reduction in speed due to her injury.
* **Calculate the time spent walking on each surface:** I incorrectly assumed the time spent on the beach was directly proportional to the distance.
* **Combine the times spent on each surface to find the total walk time:** I didn't consider the time spent walking on the sidewalk.

**Error Keywords:**

* **Speed**
* **Time**
* **Distance**
* **Proportionality**
* **Calculation**

**Corrected Solution:**

1. **Calculate Olivia's speeds:**
    * Let 'x' be Olivia's original speed on the beach.
    * Her speed on the sidewalk was 4x.
    * After her injury, her beach speed is x/2 and her sidewalk speed is 2x.

2. **Calculate the time spent on the beach:**
    * Time = Distance / Speed
    * Time on beach = 10 km / (x/2) = 20/x hours

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
    * Distance on sidewalk = 10 km
    * Time on sidewalk = 10 km / (2x) = 5/x hours

4. **Set up an equation for the total time:**
    * Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
    * Total time = 20/x + 5/x = 25/x hours

5. **Convert the total time to minutes:**
    * Total time in minutes = (25/x hours) * (60 minutes/hour) = 1500/x minutes

6. **We know 60 minutes are spent on the beach, so:**
    * 60 minutes = 20/x hours
    * x = 20/60 * 60 = 20 km/hour

7. **Substitute the value of x back into the total time equation:**
    * Total time = 1500/20 = 75 minutes



**Instructions for Future Problems:**

1. **Carefully read and understand the problem:** Identify all given information and what is being asked.
2. **Define variables:** Assign variables to represent unknown quantities.
3. **Set up equations:** Translate the problem into mathematical equations based on the given information and relationships.
4. **Solve the equations:** Use algebraic techniques to solve for the unknown variables.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Jin caught 7 trouts last Sunday, the first trout he caught weighs 62 kilograms, the second trout he caught weighs 31 kilograms, and each of the rest trout he caught weighs 16 kilograms more than the second one. If a kilogram of trout costs $2.25, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?
Your initial answer was: A: Let's think step by step...

1. **Calculate the weight of the remaining trouts:**
   - The second trout weighs 31 kilograms.
   - Each of the rest weighs 16 kilograms more, so they weigh 31 + 16 = 47 kilograms each.
   - Jin caught 7 - 2 = 5 more trouts.
   - The total weight of the remaining trouts is 5 * 47 = 235 kilograms.

2. **Calculate the total weight of all the trouts:**
   - The total weight is 62 + 31 + 235 = 328 kilograms.

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Each kilogram of trout costs $2.25.
   - Jin will earn 328 * 2.25 = $744.

**The answer is $744.**
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer

My previous answer was incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the weight of the remaining trouts. I incorrectly added 16 kilograms to the weight of the second trout to find the weight of the remaining trouts, instead of recognizing that each of the remaining trouts weighed 16 kilograms *more* than the second trout. 

**Error Keywords:**

- Calculation error
- Misinterpretation of word problem
- Arithmetic error
- Incorrect application of addition

## Corrected Solution

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:

**Explanation:** My previous answers were incorrect because I failed to accurately calculate the total weight of the car and its contents. I likely missed adding up the weight of the children and the spare tires.

**Error Keywords:**

- Calculation
- Total weight
- Addition

**Corrected Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total weight of the children:** 4 children * 65 pounds/child = 260 pounds
2. **Calculate the total weight of the spare tires:** 2 tires * 70 pounds/tire = 140 pounds
3. **Calculate the total weight of the car and its contents:** 1350 pounds (car) + 450 pounds (luggage) + 260 pounds (children) + 140 pounds (tires) = 2200 pounds
4. **Calculate the force needed:** 2200 pounds * 0.02 (2%) = 44 pounds

**Therefore, Esteban needs to push with 44 pounds of force.**

**Instructions for Future Accuracy:**

1. **List all contributing weights:**  Explicitly list the weight of each component (car, luggage, passengers, etc.).
2. **Perform a thorough addition:** Carefully add up all the listed weights to determine the total weight.
3. **Apply the percentage correctly:** Multiply the total weight by the given percentage to find the required force.
4. **Double-check calculations:**  Always review your calculations for accuracy.

**General Advice for Similar Problems:**

- **Read carefully:** Understand the specific details of the problem, including units and percentages.
- **Break down the problem:** Divide complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
