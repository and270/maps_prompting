First, let's find out how much water is in the original 20 liters of peach drink. Since the peach drink is 1/5 water, we can calculate the amount of water in it as follows:

Water in peach drink = (1/5) * 20 liters = 4 liters

Now, you spill 5 liters of the peach drink. Since the peach drink is 1/5 water, the amount of water spilled is:

Water spilled = (1/5) * 5 liters = 1 liter

So, the remaining peach drink has:

Remaining water in peach drink = 4 liters - 1 liter = 3 liters

Now, let's find out how much water is in the 16 liters of lemon drink. Since the lemon drink is 1/4 water, we can calculate the amount of water in it as follows:

Water in lemon drink = (1/4) * 16 liters = 4 liters

Now, we combine the remaining peach drink and the lemon drink. The total volume of the mixture is:

Total volume = (20 liters - 5 liters) + 16 liters = 15 liters + 16 liters = 31 liters

The total amount of water in the mixture is the sum of the water in the remaining peach drink and the water in the lemon drink:

If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 6 hours if she spends 2/4 of the time running and three-sixths of the time walking?",36.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Jasmine's running speed:**
   Jasmine can skip at 6 miles per hour, which is 3/5 of her running speed. Let \( R \) be her running speed. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5}R = 6
   \]
   Solving for \( R \):
   \[
   R = 6 \times \frac{5}{3} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Determine Jasmine's walking speed:**
   Jasmine can run five times faster than she can walk. Let \( W \) be her walking speed. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   R = 5W
   \]
   Substituting \( R = 10 \) miles per hour:
   \[
   10 = 5W
   \]
   Solving for \( W \):
   \[
   W = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time spent on each activity:**
   Jasmine spends 2/4 of the time running and 3/6 of the time walking. Since 2/4 simplifies to 1/2 and 3/6 simplifies to 1/2, she spends half of the time running and half of the time walking.

   Therefore, in 6 hours, she spends:
   \[
   \text{Time running} = 6 \times \frac{1}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time walking} = 6 \times \frac{1}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

   Note: There is an inconsistency here because the total time spent running and walking exceeds 6 hours. Let's re-evaluate the time fractions correctly.

   Jasmine spends 2/4 (which is 1/2) of the time running and 3/6 (which is 1/2) of the time walking. This is incorrect because the fractions should add up to 1 (the whole time). Let's correct this:

   Let's assume the correct fractions for running and walking are \( x \) and \( y \) respectively, such that \( x + y = 1 \).

   Given:
   \[
   x = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

   Clearly, there is a mistake in the problem statement as the fractions do not add up to 1. Let's assume the correct interpretation is that Jasmine spends \( 2/4 \) of the time running and the remaining time walking.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled:**
   Since the problem statement has an inconsistency, let's assume the correct interpretation is that Jasmine spends \( 2/4 \) of the time running and the remaining \( 2/4 \) of the time walking.

   Therefore, in 6 hours, she spends:

   Substituting \( R = 10 \) miles per hour:
   \[
   10 = 5W
   \]
   Solving for \( W \):
   \[
   W = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time spent on each activity:**
   Jasmine spends 2/4 of the time running and 3/6 of the time walking. Since 2/4 simplifies to 1/2 and 3/6 simplifies to 1/2, she spends half of the time running and half of the time walking.

   Therefore, in 6 hours, she spends:
   \[
   \text{Time running} = 6 \times \frac{1}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time walking} = 6 \times \frac{1}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

   Note: There is an inconsistency here because the total time spent running and walking exceeds 6 hours. Let's re-evaluate the time fractions correctly.

   Jasmine spends 2/4 (which is 1/2) of the time running and 3/6 (which is 1/2) of the time walking. This is incorrect because the fractions should add up to 1 (the whole time). Let's correct this:

   Let's assume the correct fractions for running and walking are \( x \) and \( y \) respectively, such that \( x + y = 1 \).

   Given:
   \[
   x = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

   Clearly, there is a mistake in the problem statement as the fractions do not add up to 1. Let's assume the correct interpretation is that Jasmine spends \( 2/4 \) of the time running and the remaining time walking.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled:**
   Since the problem statement has an inconsistency, let's assume the correct interpretation is that Jasmine spends \( 2/4 \) of the time running and the remaining \( 2/4 \) of the time walking.

   Therefore, in 6 hours, she spends:
   \[
   \text{Time running} = 6 \times \frac{2}{4} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time walking} = 6 \times \frac{2}{4} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

   Distance traveled running:
   \[
   \text{Distance running} = 10 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
   \]

   Distance traveled walking:
   \[
   \text{Distance walking} = 2 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

   Total distance traveled:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 30 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 36 \text{ miles}
   \]

So, Jasmine can travel 36 miles in 6 hours.",6.0,0,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Determine Jasmine's running speed:**
   - Jasmine can skip at 6 miles per hour, which is 3/5 of her running speed.
   - Let \( R \) be her running speed.
   - So, \( \frac{3}{5}R = 6 \) miles per hour.
   - Solving for \( R \):
     \[
     R = \frac{6 \times 5}{3} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

2. **Determine Jasmine's walking speed:**
   - Jasmine can run 5 times faster than she can walk.
   - Let \( W \) be her walking speed.
   - So, \( 5W = 10 \) miles per hour.
   - Solving for \( W \):
     \[
     W = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time spent on each activity:**
   - Total time = 6 hours.
   - Time spent running = \( \frac{2}{4} \) of 6 hours = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \) hours.
   - Time spent walking = \( \frac{3}{6} \) of 6 hours = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \) hours.
   - Time spent skipping = 6 hours - (3 hours running + 3 hours walking) = 0 hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled in each activity:**
   - Distance running = 10 miles per hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.
   - Distance walking = 2 miles per hour * 3 hours = 6 miles.
   - Distance skipping = 6 miles per hour * 0 hours = 0 miles.

5. **Total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking + Distance skipping
   - Total distance = 30 miles + 6 miles + 0 miles = 36 miles.

The answer is 36 miles.",36.0,1,0.0,1.0,36.0,,,,,,,,

   Santiago has 55 square yards of kiwi field, and there are 28 kiwis per square yard.
   Total kiwis = 55 square yards * 28 kiwis/square yard
   Total kiwis = 1540 kiwis

2. **Determine how many times Santiago can harvest in a year:**
   Santiago can harvest his kiwis every 4 months. There are 12 months in a year.
   Number of harvests per year = 12 months / 4 months/harvest
   Number of harvests per year = 3 harvests

3. **Calculate the total number of kiwis harvested in a year:**
   Total kiwis harvested in a year = Total kiwis per harvest * Number of harvests per year
   Total kiwis harvested in a year = 1540 kiwis * 3
   Total kiwis harvested in a year = 4620 kiwis

So, Santiago can harvest 4620 kiwis within a year.",4620.0,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to calculate the total number of kiwis Santiago has in his field.
   Santiago has 55 square yards of kiwi field.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,25.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then find the difference between them.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**

   The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

   \[
   P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
   \]

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**

   The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

   The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:

   \[
   P(\text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

   Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:

   \[
   P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

   Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:

   \[
   P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number on first roll}) \times P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
   \]

3. **Difference in probabilities:**

   To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:

   \[
   \text{Difference} = P(\text{number greater than 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25

   To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

   0.25 \times 100 = 25\%

   \]

3. **Difference in probabilities:**

   To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:

   \[
   \text{Difference} = P(\text{number greater than 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25
   \]

4. **Expressing the difference as a percentage:**

   To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

   \[
   0.25 \times 100 = 25\%
   \]

   240 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes per page} = 1440 \text{ minutes per week}
   \]

5. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   To find out how many hours Umar spends writing per week, convert the total minutes to hours:
   \[
   \frac{1440 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 24 \text{ hours per week}
   \]

So, Umar spends 24 hours writing a week.",24.0,1,"Umar starts with 9 pen pals.
He stops being pen pals with 3 of them.
So, he has 9 - 3 = 6 pen pals left.

Each pen pal sends 4 letters a week.
So, Umar receives 6 * 4 = 24 letters a week.

Each letter is 10 pages long.
So, the total number of pages he receives is 24 * 10 = 240 pages.

Umar responds in kind, so he also writes 240 pages a week.

He can write 1 page every 6 minutes.
So, to write 240 pages, it takes him 240 * 6 = 1440 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, divide by 60.
So, 1440 minutes / 60 = 24 hours.

After half an hour, one-fifth of the total number of people left. How many engineers are left if 26 artists stayed at the conference?",66.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of people at the beginning:**
   Total people = Number of artists + Number of engineers
   = 64 artists + 51 engineers
   = 115 people

2. **Calculate the number of people who left after half an hour:**
   One-fifth of the total number of people left.
   People who left = 1/5 * Total people

   =",26.0,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of people at the beginning:**
   - There were 64 artists and 51 engineers.
   - So, the total number of people is 64 + 51 = 115.

2. **Determine how many people left after half an hour:**
   - One-fifth of the total number of people left.
   - So, the number of people who left is 1/5 * 115 = 23.

3. **Calculate the total number of people remaining:**
   - The total number of people remaining is 115 - 23 = 92.

4. **Determine the number of artists remaining:**
   - It is given that 26 artists stayed at the conference.

5. **Calculate the number of engineers remaining:**
   - The total number of people remaining is 92.
   - The number of artists remaining is 26.
   - So, the number of engineers remaining is 92 - 26 = 66.

The answer is 66.",66.0,1,,,,,,,1.0,,,,
main,gsm-symbolic,mistralai/mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501,"At the beginning of the conference, there were 64 artists and 51 engineers. After half an hour, one-fifth of the total number of people left. How many engineers are left if 26 artists stayed at the conference?",66.0,"Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of people at the beginning:**
   Total people = Number of artists + Number of engineers
   = 64 artists + 51 engineers
   = 115 people

2. **Calculate the number of people who left after half an hour:**
   One-fifth of the total number of people left.
   People who left = 1/5 * Total people
   = 1/5 * 115
   = 23 people

3. **Calculate the total number of people remaining:**
   People remaining = Total people - People who left
   = 115 - 23
   = 92 people

4. **Calculate the number of artists who left:**
   If 26 artists stayed, then the number of artists who left is:
   Artists who left = Total artists - Artists who stayed
   = 64 - 26
   = 38 artists

5. **Calculate the number of engineers who left:**
   Since one-fifth of the total number of people left, and we know the number of artists who left, we can find the number of engineers who left by subtracting the number of artists who left from the total number of people who left.
   Engineers who left = People who left - Artists who left
   = 23 - 38
   = -15

   =",26.0,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of people at the beginning:**
   - There were 64 artists and 51 engineers.
   - So, the total number of people is 64 + 51 = 115.

2. **Determine how many people left after half an hour:**
   - One-fifth of the total number of people left.
   - So, the number of people who left is 1/5 * 115 = 23.

3. **Calculate the total number of people remaining:**
   - The total number of people remaining is 115 - 23 = 92.

4. **Determine the number of artists remaining:**
   - It is given that 26 artists stayed at the conference.

5. **Calculate the number of engineers remaining:**
   - The total number of people remaining is 92.
   - The number of artists remaining is 26.
   - So, the number of engineers remaining is 92 - 26 = 66.

3. **Plums After Reduction:**
   - The number of plums Wei has now is 45 fewer than the total number of bananas he bought, so he has 84 - 45 = 39 plums.

4. **Correct Calculation of Plums:**
   - The correct number of plums Wei has now is 380 - 45 = 335 plums (since he reduced the number of plums by 45, not the total number of bananas).

5. **Total Number of Fruits:**
   - The combined total of the number of plums and bananas Wei has in the house is 335 (plums) + 84 (bananas) = 419.

The answer is 419.

[Example Input]
Question: At Lily's house, there are seven times as many apples as oranges. She has a total of 28 oranges in her house. Lily bought 30 more oranges at the store and 25 fewer apples than the number of oranges. Find the combined total of the number of apples and oranges Lily has in the house?

Wrong answer: Lily initially has 7 * 28 = 196 apples. After buying 30 more oranges, she has 28 + 30 = 58 oranges. Since she has 25 fewer apples than oranges, she has 58 - 25 = 33 apples. Therefore, the total number of apples and oranges is 33 + 58 = 91.

Correct answer: 217

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of apples Lily initially had and did not account for the change in the number of apples after buying more oranges. I also incorrectly subtracted the number of apples from the number of oranges instead of the initial number of apples.

Error Keywords:
- Ratio miscalculation
- Arithmetic error
- Misinterpretation of the problem statement

Instructions:
1. Calculate the initial number of apples based on the given ratio and the number of oranges.
2. Calculate the new number of oranges after buying more.
3. Determine the new number of apples based on the difference from the new number of oranges.
4. Add the initial number of apples to the difference to find the total number of apples.
5. Add the total number of apples and oranges to find the combined total.

Advice:
- Carefully interpret the problem statement to understand the relationships between the quantities.
- Perform accurate calculations, especially when dealing with ratios and arithmetic operations.
- Double-check your calculations to ensure they align with the problem statement.

Solution:
1. Lily initially has 7 * 28 = 196 apples.
2. After buying 30 more oranges, she has 28 + 30 = 58 oranges.
3. Since she has 25 fewer apples than oranges, she has 196 - 25 = 171 apples.
4. Therefore, the total number of apples and oranges is 171 + 58 = 229.

She also bought a mixed bag of sand dollars for ¥11.5 and 17 postcards that were ¥20.5 each. How much money does Sofia have left?",427.0,"Let's calculate the cost of the fudge first. Sofia bought 23 kgs of fudge. The first 16 kgs are at the full price of ¥21 per kg, and the remaining 7 kgs (23 - 16 = 7) are at 2/3 off the full price.

The cost of the first 16 kgs of fudge is:
16 kgs * ¥21/kg = ¥336

The cost of the remaining 7 kgs of fudge at 2/3 off is:
2/3 of ¥21 = ¥21 * 2/3 = ¥14 per kg
7 kgs * ¥14/kg = ¥98

The total cost of the fudge is:
¥336 + ¥98 = ¥434

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixed bag of sand dollars and the postcards.

The cost of the mixed bag of sand dollars is:
¥11.5

The cost of the postcards is:
17 postcards * ¥20.5 each = ¥348.5

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Cost of fudge + Cost of sand dollars + Cost of postcards
¥434 + ¥11.5 + ¥348.5 = ¥794

First, let's calculate the cost of the fudge:
- Sofia bought 23 kgs of fudge.
- The first 16 kgs cost ¥21 per kg.
- The remaining 7 kgs (23 - 16) get a 2/3 discount.

Cost of the first 16 kgs:
16 kgs * ¥21/kg = ¥336

Cost of the remaining 7 kgs with a 2/3 discount:
Original price for 7 kgs: 7 kgs * ¥21/kg = ¥147
Discount: 2/3 of ¥147 = (2/3) * ¥147 = ¥98
Discounted price for 7 kgs: ¥147 - ¥98 = ¥49

Total cost for the fudge:
¥336 (first 16 kgs) + ¥49 (remaining 7 kgs) = ¥385

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixed bag of sand dollars:
- The mixed bag of sand dollars costs ¥11.5.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the postcards:
- Each postcard costs ¥20.5.
- Sofia bought 17 postcards.

Cost of the postcards:
17 postcards * ¥20.5/postcard = ¥348.5

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Total cost = Cost of fudge + Cost of sand dollars + Cost of postcards

Sofia bought 23 kgs of fudge. The first 16 kgs are at the full price of ¥21 per kg, and the remaining 7 kgs (23 - 16 = 7) are at 2/3 off the full price.

The cost of the first 16 kgs of fudge is:
16 kgs * ¥21/kg = ¥336

The cost of the remaining 7 kgs of fudge at 2/3 off is:
2/3 of ¥21 = ¥21 * 2/3 = ¥14 per kg

Question: Sofia went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her ¥1200 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, fudge was on sale for ""Buy 16 kgs at ¥21 per kg, get 5 kgs 2/3 off."" She scooped up 23 kgs. She also bought a mixed bag of sand dollars for ¥11.5 and 17 postcards that were ¥20.5 each. How much money does Sofia have left?
Your initial answer was: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the fudge, the mixed bag of sand dollars, and the postcards, and then subtract that from the total amount of money Sofia had.

First, let's calculate the cost of the fudge:
- Sofia bought 23 kgs of fudge.
- The first 16 kgs cost ¥21 per kg.
- The remaining 7 kgs (23 - 16) get a 2/3 discount.

Cost of the first 16 kgs:
16 kgs * ¥21/kg = ¥336

Cost of the remaining 7 kgs with a 2/3 discount:
Original price for 7 kgs: 7 kgs * ¥21/kg = ¥147
Discount: 2/3 of ¥147 = (2/3) * ¥147 = ¥98
Discounted price for 7 kgs: ¥147 - ¥98 = ¥49

Total cost for the fudge:
¥336 (first 16 kgs) + ¥49 (remaining 7 kgs) = ¥385

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixed bag of sand dollars:
- The mixed bag of sand dollars costs ¥11.5.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the postcards:
- Each postcard costs ¥20.5.
- Sofia bought 17 postcards.

Cost of the postcards:
17 postcards * ¥20.5/postcard = ¥348.5

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Total cost = Cost of fudge + Cost of sand dollars + Cost of postcards
Total cost = ¥385 + ¥11.5 + ¥348.5 = ¥745

Sofia started with ¥1200. Let's subtract the total cost from this amount:
Money left = ¥1200 - ¥745 = ¥455

The answer is ¥455.

[Example Input]
Question: Maria went shopping with ¥1500. She bought a dress for ¥300, a book for ¥45, and a pair of shoes that were ¥250 with a 20% discount. How much money does Maria have left?
Wrong answer: Maria has ¥905 left. I incorrectly calculated the discount on the shoes and did not account for the correct discount amount.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the discount on the shoes. I subtracted 20% from the original price of ¥250, but I did not correctly calculate the discount amount, which should be ¥250 * 0.20 = ¥50. Therefore, the correct price for the shoes should be ¥250 - ¥50 = ¥200. Additionally, I did not account for the correct total amount spent, which should be ¥300 (dress) + ¥45 (book) + ¥200 (shoes) = ¥545. Therefore, the correct amount of money Maria has left is ¥1500 - ¥545 = ¥955.

Error Keywords:
- Discount calculation
- Total amount calculation
- Money subtraction

Instructions:
1. Identify the original price of each item.
2. Calculate the discount for each item if applicable.
3. Subtract the discount from the original price to get the final price of each item.
4. Sum up the final prices of all items to get the total amount spent.
5. Subtract the total amount spent from the original amount of money to get the remaining amount.

Advice:
- Always double-check the discount calculations.
- Ensure that all items are accounted for in the total amount spent.
- Be careful when subtracting the total amount spent from the original amount of money.

Solution:
Maria has ¥955 left. The correct calculation is as follows:
- Dress: ¥300

Question: Maria went shopping with ¥1500. She bought 10 apples at ¥3 each, 5 oranges at ¥4 each, and a special deal of 8 bananas at ¥1.5 each with a 20% discount on the total price of the bananas. She also bought a book for ¥25. How much money does Maria have left?

Wrong answer: Maria spent ¥30 on apples, ¥20 on oranges, ¥12 on bananas (without considering the discount), and ¥25 on the book. So, she spent a total of ¥87 and has ¥1413 left.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the discount on the bananas and did not account for the 20% discount on the total price of the bananas.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation of discounts
- Incorrect total calculation
- Overlooking the discount on the total price of bananas

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total cost of the apples: 10 apples * ¥3 each = ¥30.
2. Calculate the total cost of the oranges: 5 oranges * ¥4 each = ¥20.
3. Calculate the total cost of the bananas before the discount: 8 bananas * ¥1.5 each = ¥12.
4. Apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the bananas: 20% of ¥12 = ¥2.4. So, the discounted cost of the bananas is ¥12 - ¥2.4 = ¥9.6.
5. Calculate the total cost of the book: ¥25.
6. Sum up all the costs: ¥30 (apples) + ¥20 (oranges) + ¥9.6 (bananas) + ¥25 (book) = ¥84.6.
7. Subtract the total cost from the initial amount: ¥1500 - ¥84.6 = ¥1415.4.

Advice:
- Always check for discounts and apply them correctly.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Reflection

**Explanation:**
I incorrectly calculated the discount on the fudge and did not account for the correct pricing structure for the additional 5 kgs. Additionally, I miscalculated the total cost of the postcards.

**Error Keywords:**
- Miscalculation of discounts
- Incorrect total calculation
- Overlooking the discount on the additional 5 kgs of fudge
- Incorrect multiplication of postcards

### Corrected Solution

1. **Calculate the cost of the first 16 kgs of fudge:**
   - 16 kgs * ¥21/kg = ¥336

2. **Calculate the cost of the additional 7 kgs of fudge (23 kgs - 16 kgs):**
   - The additional 5 kgs are at 2/3 off, so the discount is 2/3 of ¥21 = ¥14.
   - The discounted price for the additional 5 kgs is ¥21 - ¥14 = ¥7/kg.
   - The cost for the additional 5 kgs is 5 kgs * ¥7/kg = ¥35.
   - The remaining 2 kgs are at the full price of ¥21/kg.
   - The cost for the remaining 2 kgs is 2 kgs * ¥21/kg = ¥42.
   - Total cost for the additional 7 kgs is ¥35 + ¥42 = ¥77.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the fudge:**
   - Total cost = ¥336 (first 16 kgs) + ¥77 (additional 7 kgs) = ¥413

4. **Calculate the cost of the mixed bag of sand dollars:**
   - ¥11.5

5. **Calculate the cost of the postcards:**
   - 17 postcards * ¥20.5 each = ¥348.5

6. **Sum up all the costs:**
   - Total cost = ¥413 (fudge) + ¥11.5 (sand dollars) + ¥348.5 (postcards) = ¥773

7. **Subtract the total cost from the initial amount:**
   - ¥1200 - ¥773 = ¥427

### Instructions for Future Reference

1. **Identify the pricing structure for each item:**
   - Determine the cost of the fudge based on the given deal.
   - Calculate the cost of the additional kgs of fudge with the correct discount.

2. **Calculate the total cost of each item:**
   - Multiply the quantity by the price for each item.
   - Apply any discounts or special deals accurately.

3. **Sum up all the individual costs:**
   - Add the costs of all items to get the total expenditure.

4. **Subtract the total expenditure from the initial amount:**
   - Calculate the remaining money.

### General Advice

- Always carefully read and understand the pricing structures and discounts.
- Double-check calculations, especially for items with special deals or discounts.
- Ensure all items are accounted for in the total cost calculation.
- Verify the final amount by rechecking the subtraction from the initial amount.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

[Example Input]
Question: Maria went shopping with ¥1500. She bought 10 apples at ¥3 each, 5 oranges at ¥4 each, and a special deal of 8 bananas at ¥1.5 each with a 20% discount on the total price of the bananas. She also bought a book for ¥25. How much money does Maria have left?

Wrong answer: Maria spent ¥30 on apples, ¥20 on oranges, ¥12 on bananas (without considering the discount), and ¥25 on the book. So, she spent a total of ¥87 and has ¥1413 left.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the discount on the bananas and did not account for the 20% discount on the total price of the bananas.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation of discounts
- Incorrect total calculation
- Overlooking the discount on the total price of bananas

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total cost of the apples: 10 apples * ¥3 each = ¥30.
2. Calculate the total cost of the oranges: 5 oranges * ¥4 each = ¥20.
3. Calculate the total cost of the bananas before the discount: 8 bananas * ¥1.5 each = ¥12.
4. Apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the bananas: 20% of ¥12 = ¥2.4. So, the discounted cost of the bananas is ¥12 - ¥2.4 = ¥9.6.
5. Calculate the total cost of the book: ¥25.
6. Sum up all the costs: ¥30 (apples) + ¥20 (oranges) + ¥9.6 (bananas) + ¥25 (book) = ¥84.6.
7. Subtract the total cost from the initial amount: ¥1500 - ¥84.6 = ¥1415.4.

Advice:
- Always check for discounts and apply them correctly.
- Double-check the total cost by summing up all individual costs.
- Be mindful of the pricing structures and apply any special deals or discounts accurately.

Solution:
Maria spent ¥30 on apples, ¥20 on oranges, ¥9.6 on bananas (after the discount), and ¥25 on the book. So, she spent a total of ¥84.6 and has ¥1415.4 left.

We are given that the area is 660 square meters and the length is 5 meters. We can rearrange the formula to solve for the width:

Width = Area ÷ Length
Width = 660 ÷ 5
Width = 132 meters

Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

P = 2 × (Length + Width)

Substitute the known values:

P = 2 × (5 + 132)
P = 2 × 137
P = 274 meters

So, the perimeter of Andre's study is 274 meters.",274.0,1,"To find the perimeter of Andre's study, we first need to determine the width of the room using the area. We know the area (A) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

A = length × width

A = 660 square meters
length = 5 meters

We can solve for the width (w) as follows:

660 = 5 × w
w = 660 / 5
w = 132 meters

Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter (P) of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by:

P = 2 × (length + width)

If the normal brand costs ₣15 per kilogram, and the more expensive brand costs 40% more, we need to find 40% of ₣15 and add it to the original price.

40% of ₣15 is calculated as:
0.40 * ₣15 = ₣6

So, the more expensive tea costs ₣6 more per kilogram than the normal brand. Therefore, the price per kilogram of the more expensive tea is:
₣15 + ₣6 = ₣21

₣21/kg * 14 kg = ₣294

   Total amount Pavel has = Pavel's money + Charity's contribution
   Total amount Pavel has = ₣70 + ₣118

1. **Calculate the number of occupied rooms initially:**
   The facility has 1900 rooms, and 2/5 of them are occupied.

   Since 1120 patients are admitted in 2 weeks, and there were initially 1140 unoccupied rooms, we subtract the number of admitted patients from the initial unoccupied rooms.
   Unoccupied rooms after 2 weeks = Initial unoccupied rooms - Patients admitted in 2 weeks

On Tuesday, she sold 9 more boxes of cupcakes than on Monday and 20 boxes of cookies. If the cupcakes cost $5 and the cookies cost $3, how much did Maria earn for two days?

Wrong answer: Maria sold 15 + 9 = 24 boxes of cupcakes on Tuesday. She sold 20 - 8 = 12 boxes of cookies on Monday. Therefore, she sold 24 + 12 = 36 boxes in total. The total earnings are 36 * 5 = $180.

Correct answer: Maria sold 15 + 9 = 24 boxes of cupcakes on Tuesday. She sold 20 - 8 = 12 boxes of cookies on Monday. She sold 15 + 20 = 35 boxes of cupcakes and cookies on Monday and 24 + 20 = 44 boxes on Tuesday. The total earnings are (15 * 5 + 12 * 3) + (24 * 5 + 20 * 3) = $75 + $135 = $210.

- Multiple variables
- Misinterpretation of the problem
- Incorrect total calculation

Instructions:
1. Identify the number of boxes sold for each item on each day.
2. Calculate the total number of boxes sold for each day.
3. Multiply the number of boxes by the price for each item.
4. Sum the earnings for each day to get the total earnings.

Advice:
- Carefully read and interpret the problem to ensure all variables are accounted for.
- Double-check arithmetic operations to avoid simple calculation errors.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Kimia has a flower bed that is 180 feet long. Kimia wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Kimia's flowers grow 3 feet wide so she needs to leave 15.0 feet between every plant. Kimia already owns 11 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ¥3 at the store, how much money will Kimia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?
Your initial answer was: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many plants Kimia can fit in her 180-foot-long flower bed, considering the space each plant requires, and then calculate the cost of the additional plants she needs to buy.

1. **Calculate the total space required for each plant:**
   Each plant grows 3 feet wide and requires 15.0 feet of space between plants. So, the total space required for each plant is:
   3 feet (width of the plant) + 15.0 feet (space between plants) = 18.0 feet per plant.

2. **Determine how many plants can fit in the 180-foot-long flower bed:**
   To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required per plant:
   180 feet / 18.0 feet per plant = 10 plants.

3. **Calculate the number of additional plants Kimia needs to buy:**
   Kimia already owns 11 plants, but she can only fit 10 plants in the flower bed. Therefore, she does not need to buy any additional plants.

4. **Calculate the cost of the additional plants:**
   Since Kimia does not need to buy any additional plants, the cost will be:
   0 plants * ¥3 per plant = ¥0.

The answer is ¥0.
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","### Reflection

**Explanation:**
I incorrectly assumed that Kimia could not fit more than 10 plants in the 180-foot-long flower bed. The error was in not considering that the first plant does not require space before it, leading to an incorrect calculation of the number of plants that can fit.

**Error Keywords:**
- Calculation error
- Misinterpretation of spatial requirements
- Incorrect division
- Misunderstanding of the problem constraints

### Corrected Solution

1. **Calculate the total space required for each plant:**
   Each plant grows 3 feet wide and requires 15.0 feet of space between plants. So, the total space required for each plant is:
   3 feet (width of the plant) + 15.0 feet (space between plants) = 18.0 feet per plant.

2. **Determine how many plants can fit in the 180-foot-long flower bed:**
   To find out how many plants can fit, we need to consider that the first plant does not require space before it. Therefore, the total space required for n plants is:
   3 feet (width of the first plant) + 15.0 feet * (n - 1) (space between the remaining n-1 plants) = 180 feet.

   Simplifying, we get:
   3 + 15(n - 1) = 180
   3 + 15n - 15 = 180
   15n - 12 = 180
   15n = 192
   n = 192 / 15
   n = 12.8

   Since we cannot have a fraction of a plant, Kimia can fit 12 plants.

3. **Calculate the number of additional plants Kimia needs to buy:**
   Kimia already owns 11 plants, and she can fit 12 plants in the flower bed. Therefore, she needs to buy:
   12 - 11 = 1 additional plant.

4. **Calculate the cost of the additional plants:**
   The cost of 1 additional plant is:
   1 plant * ¥3 per plant = ¥3.

The answer is ¥3.

### Instructions for Future Problems

1. **Identify the total length of the flower bed.**
2. **Determine the space required per plant, including the width of the plant and the space between plants.**
3. **Calculate the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed, considering that the first plant does not require space before it.**
4. **Determine the number of additional plants needed by subtracting the number of plants Kimia already owns from the total number of plants that can fit.**
5. **Calculate the cost of the additional plants by multiplying the number of additional plants by the cost per plant.**
6. **Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.**
7. **Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.**

Question: Maria has a garden that is 200 feet long. Maria wants to fill her garden with trees. Maria's trees grow 4 feet wide so she needs to leave 20.0 feet between every tree. Maria already owns 10 trees. Each tree costs ¥5 at the store, how much money will Maria spend at the store to fill up her garden?

Wrong answer: Maria needs to plant 40 trees in total. She already has 10, so she needs to buy 30 more. Therefore, she will spend 30 * ¥5 = ¥150.

Correct answer: Maria needs to plant 40 trees in total. She already has 10, so she needs to buy 30 more. Therefore, she will spend 30 * ¥5 = ¥150.

[Example Output]

Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of trees needed to fill the garden. I did not account for the space between the trees and the width of the trees correctly.

Error Keywords:
- Arithmetic error
- Misinterpretation of spatial arrangement
- Incorrect calculation of the number of plants needed

Instructions:
1. Determine the total length of the garden.
2. Calculate the total space required for one tree, including the space between trees.
3. Divide the total length of the garden by the total space required for one tree to find the number of trees needed.
4. Subtract the number of trees already owned from the total number of trees needed.
5. Multiply the number of trees needed by the cost per tree to find the total cost.

Advice:
- Always double-check the calculations for spatial arrangements.
- Ensure that the total space required for each plant, including the space between them, is correctly calculated.
- Verify the arithmetic steps to avoid simple calculation errors.

Solution:
1. The total length of the garden is 200 feet.
2. Each tree requires 4 feet of width and 20 feet of space between trees, so the total space required for one tree is 4 + 20 = 24 feet.
3. The number of trees needed is 200 / 24 = 8.33, which rounds down to 8 trees (since you can't plant a fraction of a tree).
4. Maria already has 10 trees, so she needs to buy 0 more trees.
5. The total cost is 0 * ¥5 = ¥0.

[Example Input]

Question: Maria has a garden that is 200 feet long. Maria wants to fill her garden with trees. Maria's trees grow 4 feet wide so she needs to leave 20.0 feet between every tree. Maria already owns 10 trees. Each tree costs ¥5 at the store, how much money will Maria spend at the store to fill up her garden?

Wrong answer: Maria needs to plant 40 trees in total. She already has 10, so she needs to buy 30 more. Therefore, she will spend 30 * ¥5 = ¥150.

Correct answer: Maria needs to plant 40 trees in total. She already has 10, so she needs to buy 30 more. Therefore, she will spend 30 * ¥5 = ¥150.

[Example Output]

Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of trees needed to fill the garden. I did not account for the space between the trees and the width of the trees correctly.

Error Keywords:
- Arithmetic error
- Misinterpretation of spatial arrangement
- Incorrect calculation of the number of plants needed

Instructions:
1. Determine the total length of the garden.
2. Calculate the total space required for one tree, including the space between trees.
3. Divide the total length of the garden by the total space required for one tree to find the number of trees needed.
4. Subtract the number of trees already owned from the total number of trees needed.
5. Multiply the number of trees needed by the cost per tree to find the total cost.

Advice:
- Always double-check the calculations for spatial arrangements.
- Ensure that the total space required for each plant, including the space between them, is correctly calculated.
- Verify the arithmetic steps to avoid simple calculation errors.

Solution:
1. The total length of the garden is 200 feet.
2. Each tree requires 4 feet of width and 20 feet of space between trees, so the total space required for one tree is 4 + 20 = 24 feet.
3. The number of trees needed is 200 / 24 = 8.33, which rounds down to 8 trees (since you can't plant a fraction of a tree).
4. Maria already has 10 trees, so she needs to buy 0 more trees.
5. The total cost is 0 * ¥5 = ¥0.

**Explanation:**
I miscalculated the total number of trees needed by not accounting for the initial and ending spaces required for the trees and the space between them.

**Error Keywords:**
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect total count
- Missing initial and ending spaces

**Instructions:**
1. Determine the total length of the garden.
2. Calculate the total space required for one tree, including the space between trees.
3. Divide the total length of the garden by the total space required for one tree to find the number of trees that can fit.
4. Subtract the number of trees already owned by the person.

6. Add the cost of the trees to be bought to the total cost.

**Advice:**
- Always consider the initial and ending spaces when calculating the number of items that can fit in a given length.
- Double-check the calculations to ensure all spaces are accounted for.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid miscalculations.

**Solution:**
1. The total length of the garden is 200 feet.
2. Each tree requires 4 feet of space, and there needs to be 12 feet between each tree, so the total space required for one tree is 4 + 12 = 16 feet.
3. To find the number of trees that can fit, divide the total length of the garden by the total space required for one tree: 200 / 16 = 12.5. Since we can't have half a tree, we round down to 12 trees.

Fatima can peel 10 clams per minute. To find out how long it will take her to peel 90 clams, we divide the total number of clams by the rate at which she can peel them:

\[ \text{Time to peel 90 clams} = \frac{90 \text{ clams}}{10 \text{ clams/minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the time to saute 90 clams
Fatima can saute 30 clams in 7 minutes. To find out how long it will take her to saute 90 clams, we first determine how many batches of 30 clams are in 90 clams:

\[ \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ clams}}{30 \text{ clams/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches} \]

Since each batch takes 7 minutes to saute, the total time to saute 90 clams is:

\[ \text{Time to saute 90 clams} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 7 \text{ minutes/batch} = 21 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 3: Combine the times
Now, we add the time to peel the clams and the time to saute the clams to find the total time:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to saute} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 9 \text{ minutes} + 21 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

First, let's find out how many history questions there are:
20% of 100 is 20/100 * 100 = 20.
So, there are 20 history questions.
Emma is sure to get 5% of these correct, so she will get:
5/100 * 20 = 1 history question correct.

The rest of the questions are economics and chemistry questions, which is:
100 - 20 = 80 questions.

These are equally divided between economics and chemistry, so there are:
80 / 2 = 40 economics questions and 40 chemistry questions.

Emma will get a quarter of the economics questions correct, which is:
1/4 * 40 = 10 economics questions.

She will also get a quarter of the chemistry questions correct, which is:
1/4 * 40 = 10 chemistry questions.

Now, look at this question:
Question: If Rania and Kimia have 900 yards of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Kimia getting 30 yards more than Rania, how much is left over for Rania?
Your initial answer was: To solve this problem, we need to determine how much fence each person gets and then find out how much is left over for Rania.

1. Let's denote the amount of fence Rania gets as \( R \) yards.
2. Since Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, Kimia gets \( R + 30 \) yards.
3. The total amount of fence they have together is 900 yards.
4. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   R + (R + 30) = 900
   \]
5. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   2R + 30 = 900
   \]
6. Subtract 30 from both sides:
   \[
   2R = 870
   \]
7. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   R = 435
   \]
8. So, Rania gets 435 yards of fence.
9. Since Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, Kimia gets:
   \[
   435 + 30 = 465 \text{ yards}
   \]
10. To find out how much is left over for Rania, we need to check if the total adds up to 900 yards:
    \[
    435 + 465 = 900
    \]
11. Since the total is exactly 900 yards, there is no leftover for Rania.

The answer is 0.
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections.
","### Reflection

**Explanation:**
I initially answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the problem as asking for the leftover fence after distributing the 900 yards. The problem actually asks for the amount left over for Rania, which is not zero because the problem does not imply that the fence is left over after the distribution.

**Error Keywords:**
- Misinterpretation of the problem
- Misunderstanding of the question
- Incorrect problem decomposition
- Misreading instructions

### Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( R \) be the amount of fence Rania gets.
   Let \( K \) be the amount of fence Kimia gets.

2. **Relationship between Rania and Kimia's Fence:**
   Since Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, we have:
   \[
   K = R + 30
   \]

3. **Total Fence:**
   The total amount of fence is 900 yards:
   \[
   R + K = 900
   \]

4. **Substitute \( K \) in the Total Fence Equation:**
   \[
   R + (R + 30) = 900
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   2R + 30 = 900
   \]

5. **Solve for \( R \):**
   Subtract 30 from both sides:
   \[
   2R = 870
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   R = 435
   \]

6. **Calculate Kimia's Fence:**
   \[
   K = R + 30 = 435 + 30 = 465
   \]

7. **Determine the amount left over for Rania:**
   The question asks for the amount left over for Rania, which is not explicitly stated in the problem. However, since both Rania and Kimia together get exactly 900 yards, there is no leftover fence.

### Instructions:

1. **Read the Problem Carefully:**
   Ensure you understand the question and what it is asking for.
2. **Define Variables:**
   Clearly define the variables representing the amounts of fence for Rania and Kimia.
3. **Establish Relationships:**
   Set up the relationship between Rania and Kimia's amounts of fence.
4. **Formulate Equations:**
   Use the total amount of fence and the relationship to form equations.
5. **Solve Equations:**
   Solve the equations step-by-step to find the amounts of fence for Rania and Kimia.
6. **Check for Misinterpretations:**
   Double-check that you have correctly interpreted the problem and are solving for the correct quantity.
7. **Verify the Solution:**
   Ensure the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
8. **Identify the Correct Answer:**
   Clearly state the amount left over for Rania based on the problem's context.

Since Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, Kimia will get R + 30 yards.

According to the problem, the total amount of fence they have together is 900 yards. So we can write the equation:

R + (R + 30) = 900

Now, let's solve for R:

2R + 30 = 900

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2R = 900 - 30
2R = 870

Divide both sides by 2:

R = 870 / 2
R = 435

So, Rania gets 435 yards of fence. Since Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, Kimia gets:

435 + 30 = 465 yards

To find out how much is left over for Rania, we need to check if the total adds up to 900 yards:

435 (Rania's share) + 465 (Kimia's share) = 900 yards

2. Since Kimia gets 30 yards more than Rania, Kimia gets \( R + 30 \) yards.
3. The total amount of fence they have together is 900 yards.
4. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   R + (R + 30) = 900

5. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   2R + 30 = 900

Question: If Sara and Leila have 1200 yards of ribbon between them, and they agree to split it with Leila getting 40 yards more than Sara, how much is left over for Sara?
Wrong answer: I divided 1200 by 2 and then subtracted 40 from the result, which gave me 560 yards for Sara. However, this is incorrect because I did not account for the extra 40 yards that Leila gets.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the problem by dividing the total yards by 2 instead of setting up an equation that accounts for the extra 40 yards that Leila gets. I also made an arithmetic error by not correctly distributing the extra yards.

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of the problem
- Incorrect equation setup
- Arithmetic errors

Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully to understand the total amount of yards and the distribution agreement.
2. Set up an equation that represents the total amount of yards and the extra yards that one person gets.
3. Solve the equation to find the amount of yards for each person.
4. Perform the necessary arithmetic operations to find the remaining yards for the other person.

Advice:
- Always read word problems carefully to ensure you understand the distribution agreement.
- Set up equations that accurately represent the problem.
- Perform arithmetic operations carefully and double-check your work.

Solution:
Let's denote the amount of yards Sara gets as S and the amount of yards Leila gets as L. According to the problem, we have:
L = S + 40
S + L = 1200
Substituting the first equation into the second, we get:
S + (S + 40) = 1200
2S + 40 = 1200
2S = 1200 - 40
2S = 1160
S = 1160 / 2
S = 580
So, Sara gets 580 yards, and Leila gets 580 + 40 = 620 yards. Therefore, there are no yards left over for Sara.

main,gsm-symbolic,mistralai/mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501,There are 7 periods in the day for a normal student but Hiroshi has to take 2 extra classes. Each class is 35 minutes long. He goes to class for 4 days a week. He then spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,42.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of classes Hiroshi attends each day:**
   Hiroshi has 7 regular periods plus 2 extra classes, so he attends:
   7 + 2 = 9 classes per day

2. **Calculate the total minutes Hiroshi spends in class each day:**
   Each class is 35 minutes long, so for 9 classes:
   9 classes/day * 35 minutes/class = 315 minutes/day

3. **Calculate the total minutes Hiroshi spends in class each week:**
   Hiroshi goes to class for 4 days a week, so:
   315 minutes/day * 4 days/week = 1260 minutes/week

4. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   Hiroshi spends three-sixths of his weekly class minutes each on Saturday and Sunday. First, find three-sixths of 1260 minutes:
   (3/6) * 1260 minutes = 630 minutes

   Since he spends this amount on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time is:
   630 minutes/day * 2 days = 1260 minutes

5. **Calculate the total weekly learning time in minutes:**
   Add the class time and the extra learning time:
   1260 minutes (class time) + 1260 minutes (extra learning time) = 2520 minutes/week

6. **Convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours:**
   There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
   2520 minutes/week ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 42 hours/week

Hiroshi spends 42 hours a week learning.",42.0,1,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Hiroshi spends in class during the week and then add the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Emma to walk 11 miles on the beach. We know that she spends 66 minutes on the beach. To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

\[ 66 \text{ minutes} = \frac{66}{60} \text{ hours} = 1.1 \text{ hours} \]

**Explanation:**
I made an error in calculating the total weight of the trouts Gabriel caught. The correct total weight should be calculated by adding the weights of all five trouts, but I only added the weights of three trouts. Additionally, I incorrectly calculated the total earnings by multiplying the incorrect total weight by the price per kilogram.

**Error Keywords:**
- Calculation error
- Addition error
- Multiplication error
- Misinterpretation of problem details (I did not consider that Gabriel caught 5 trouts)
- Incorrect problem decomposition

### Solution

1. **Identify the number of trouts caught:**
   - Gabriel caught 5 trouts.

2. **Identify the weights of the trouts:**
   - The first trout weighs 43 kilograms.
