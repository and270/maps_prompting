She bought 6 dozen croissants which cost $19 per dozen, 4 dozen macarons which cost $77 per dozen, and 3 dozen brownies for $118 per dozen. How much was the total cost if she received 25% discount on all purchases?",582.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, calculate the cost for each type of baked good:
   - For croissants: 6 dozen at $19 per dozen gives 6 * $19 = $114.
   - For macarons: 4 dozen at $77 per dozen gives 4 * $77 = $308.
   - For brownies: 3 dozen at $118 per dozen gives 3 * $118 = $354.

2. Now, add all these amounts to get the total cost before the discount:
   Total cost = $114 + $308 + $354 = $776.

3. Apply the 25% discount on the total purchase:
   Discount amount = 25% of $776 = 0.25 * $776 = $194.

4. Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount:
   Final cost = $776 - $194 = $582.

But as I pour it, I spill 7 liters of the mango drink. To make up for that, I add 7 liters of water to the mix. What percentage of the final mix is water?",50.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. You start with 16 liters of mango drink, which is one-ninth water. This means that in the full 16 liters, the water content is (1/9) × 16 = 16/9 liters.

2. As you pour the mango drink, you spill 7 liters of it. Since the spilled mixture has the same composition as the mango drink, the spilled water is (1/9) × 7 = 7/9 liters. 
 • Therefore, the remaining mango drink is 16 − 7 = 9 liters, and the water in the remaining mango drink is 16/9 − 7/9 = 9/9 = 1 liter.
 • The non-water part in the remaining mango drink is 9 liters − 1 liter = 8 liters.

3. The apple drink is 14 liters with one-half water. This means that the apple drink contains:
 • Water: (1/2) × 14 = 7 liters.
 • Non-water: the remaining 7 liters.

4. Now, combine the drinks:
 • Mango drink: 9 liters (1 liter water + 8 liters non-water).
 • Apple drink: 14 liters (7 liters water + 7 liters non-water).

5. Before finalizing the mix, you add an extra 7 liters of water to compensate for the spillage.
 • Extra water: 7 liters.

6. Now, calculate the total volume of the final mix:
 • Total volume = Mango drink (9 liters) + Apple drink (14 liters) + Extra water (7 liters) = 9 + 14 + 7 = 30 liters.

7. Next, sum up the water in the final mix:
 • Water from mango drink: 1 liter.
 • Water from apple drink: 7 liters.
 • Extra water added: 7 liters.
 • Total water = 1 + 7 + 7 = 15 liters.

8. Finally, determine the percentage of water in the final mix:
 • Percentage of water = (Total water / Total volume) × 100 = (15 / 30) × 100 = 50%.

If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 10 hours if she spends 2/5 of the time running, 1/2 of the time skipping, and the remaining of the time walking?",27.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Let Mei’s walking speed be x miles per hour.  
2. Since she runs four times faster than she walks, her running speed is 4x mph.  
3. Her skipping speed is half her running speed, so it is (1/2) * 4x = 2x mph.  

4. We are given that her skipping speed is 2 mph, so:  
  2x = 2  
  x = 1  
  Thus, her walking speed is 1 mph and her running speed is 4 mph.

5. Mei spends a total of 10 hours traveling.  
  Time spent running = (2/5) × 10 = 4 hours  
  Time spent skipping = (1/2) × 10 = 5 hours  
  Time spent walking = 10 - (4 + 5) = 1 hour

6. Now, calculate the distance covered in each type of movement:  
  Running distance = 4 mph × 4 hours = 16 miles  
  Skipping distance = 2 mph × 5 hours = 10 miles  
  Walking distance = 1 mph × 1 hour = 1 mile

1. First, calculate your net calorie consumption so far. You have consumed 1200 calories but burned 100 calories through exercise. This gives a net consumption of 1200 – 100 = 1100 calories.

2. Next, determine your remaining calorie allowance for the day. With a daily calorie target of 2300 calories, you can still consume 2300 – 1100 = 1200 calories.

1. On Saturday, Noah watched 4 hours of TV.
2. On Sunday, he watched 4 hours of TV.
3. On Tuesday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. Since 45 minutes is 0.75 hours, Tuesday’s total is 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.
4. On Wednesday, he watched two 5-hour episodes, so he watched 2 × 5 = 10 hours.

Jin has an orange field of 55 square meters.

We are told that there are 44 oranges for every one-half (0.5) square meter. First, we need to find out how many oranges are produced per one square meter.

Since 0.5 square meter yields 44 oranges, 1 square meter will yield:
44 * 2 = 88 oranges.

Next, we calculate the number of oranges harvested in one harvest over the entire field:
88 oranges per square meter * 55 square meters = 4840 oranges.

Jin can harvest his oranges every 12 months (once a year). Since he is harvesting for 2 years, he will have:

   • Bond paper: 1 rim at ₣10 gives ₣10.
   • Crayons: 3 crayons at ₣11 each gives 3 × 11 = ₣33.

1. For a 20-sided die, there are 20 outcomes. A number greater than 10 means any of the numbers 11 through 20. That gives 10 favorable outcomes.  
   So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is 10/20 = 1/2 = 50%.

2. Next, the probability of rolling an odd number on one roll is determined by the fact that there are 10 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ..., 19) out of 20 total outcomes. Thus, the probability for one odd roll is 10/20 = 1/2.  
   For four consecutive odd rolls, since each roll is independent, the probability becomes (1/2)^4 = 1/16 = 6.25%.

3. Now, we want to know how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll four odd numbers in a row.  
   We compare the probabilities by dividing the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 by the probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row:  
   (1/2) / (1/16) = (1/2) × 16 = 8.  
   This means rolling a number greater than 10 is 8 times as likely as rolling four odd numbers in a row.

4. To express this as a percentage increase, we note that being 8 times as likely means it is 700% more likely (because an 100% increase would double the probability, so an 8-fold increase is a 700% increase).  
   Calculation: (8 - 1) × 100% = 7 × 100% = 700%.

  4 penpals × 3 letters each = 12 letters.

3. Since Yuki ""responds in kind,"" he sends a reply letter for each letter he receives. Therefore, he writes another 12 letters. This means he writes a total of 12 letters per week.

   3% of $540,000 = 0.03 × 540,000 = $16,200.

3. He also paid an agent fee that is 6% of the selling price:
   6% of $540,000 = 0.06 × 540,000 = $32,400.

4. He paid $260,000 for the remaining loan amount of the apartment.

5. He also paid $5,000 for closing costs.

6. Now, add up all these fees and costs:
   Total expenses = Registration fee + Agent fee + Loan amount + Closing costs
                   = $16,200 + $32,400 + $260,000 + $5,000
                   = $313,600.

7. The net proceeds from selling the apartment is the selling price minus the total expenses:
   Net proceeds = $540,000 − $313,600 = $226,400.

How many friends can she invite?",2.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Emma's total budget is €180.

2. The bus rental cost is €60, so the remaining budget for activities is:

3. Each person (Emma and each friend) gets:
   - 1 round of laser tag at €6,
   - €4 in pinball tokens, and

1. Each bowl holds 21 crackers.  
2. Each plate holds two times that, so each plate holds 21 * 2 = 42 crackers.  
3. Deshawn has 11 bowls. In total, the bowls can hold 11 * 21 = 231 crackers.  
4. He also has 4 plates. In total, the plates can hold 4 * 42 = 168 crackers.  
5. So, all bowls and plates together can hold 231 + 168 = 399 crackers.  
6. Deshawn starts with 615 crackers, but then he eats a third of them. After eating, he has 615 * (2/3) = 410 crackers left.  
7. Since the bowls and plates can hold only 399 crackers, the remaining crackers that cannot be placed is 410 - 399 = 11 crackers.

James is currently 8 years old.  
In 4 years, Jasmine will be 4 times as old as James is now, meaning she will be 4 × 8 = 32 years old.  
Since this age is in 4 years, Jasmine's current age is 32 - 4 = 28 years.  

Now, we need to find their ages in 6 years.  
In 6 years, James will be 8 + 6 = 14 years old.  
In 6 years, Jasmine will be 28 + 6 = 34 years old.

The average of their ages in 6 years is calculated by (14 + 34) / 2 = 48 / 2 = 24.

It takes 18 skeins of wool to make a poncho, 17 for a hat, 15 for a beanie, 8 for a pair of booties, and 16 for a pair of gloves. Emma wants to make two warm jackets for herself, each needing 11 skeins of wool. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?",318.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, calculate the wool needed for Emma's grandchildren. There are 4 grandchildren, and for each one, Emma makes:
   - A poncho: 18 skeins
   - A hat: 17 skeins
   - A beanie: 15 skeins
   - A pair of booties: 8 skeins
   - A pair of gloves: 16 skeins

2. For each item:
   - Poncho total = 18 × 4 = 72 skeins
   - Hat total = 17 × 4 = 68 skeins
   - Beanie total = 15 × 4 = 60 skeins
   - Booties total = 8 × 4 = 32 skeins
   - Gloves total = 16 × 4 = 64 skeins

3. Now, add these to find the total for the grandchildren:
   Total for grandchildren = 72 + 68 + 60 + 32 + 64 = 296 skeins

4. Next, calculate the wool needed for Emma's jackets. Emma makes 2 jackets, and each jacket needs 11 skeins:
   Total for jackets = 11 × 2 = 22 skeins

5. Finally, add both totals:
   Overall total skeins = 296 (for grandchildren) + 22 (for jackets) = 318 skeins

1. Kayla writes the full alphabet 5 times. Since the alphabet has 26 letters, this gives her 5 × 26 = 130 letters.

1. Santiago’s normal flour costs ₣10 per kilogram. However, he has to buy a brand that costs 40% more. So, the new cost per kilogram is:
   ₣10 + 40% of ₣10 = ₣10 + 0.40 × ₣10 = ₣10 + ₣4 = ₣14.

2. He uses 3 kilograms of flour per day and buys a week’s worth of flour. Assuming a week has 7 days, he buys:
   3 kg/day × 7 days = 21 kg of flour.

3. The total cost for the flour is:
   21 kg × ₣14 per kg = ₣294.

4. In addition, Santiago buys a bagel for ₣4. Adding this to the flour cost, his total before discount is:

   - A pack of action figures where the number of action figures is twice the combined number of blocks and stuffed animals. First, we add the blocks and stuffed animals: 31 + 6 = 37. Then, multiplying by 2 gives: 2 × 37 = 74 action figures.
   - A crayon box with 12 crayons.
   - A tower of stacking rings with 33 rings.

2. Now, we sum all these toys:
   31 (blocks) + 6 (stuffed animals) = 37  
   37 + 74 (action figures) = 111  
   111 + 12 (crayons) = 123

1. Each goat needs 9 kilograms of grain.

2. Each alpaca needs 3 kilograms less than twice what a goat needs. First, twice what a goat needs is 2 × 9 = 18 kilograms, and then subtract 3 to get 18 - 3 = 15 kilograms per alpaca.

3. Each cow eats as much as a goat and an alpaca eat together. So, one cow eats 9 (goat) + 15 (alpaca) = 24 kilograms.

4. Now, calculate the total for each type of animal:
   • 21 goats eat 21 × 9 = 189 kilograms.
   • 7 alpacas eat 7 × 15 = 105 kilograms.
   • 21 cows eat 21 × 24 = 504 kilograms.

1. The hospital has a total of 800 beds.
2. Initially, 1/8 of the beds are occupied. So, the number of occupied beds is 800 × (1/8) = 100.
3. Also, one-fifth of all beds are out of service. That is 800 × (1/5) = 160 beds.
4. This means the number of working (or available) beds is 800 − 160 = 640.
5. Initially, out of these 640 working beds, 100 are occupied, leaving 640 − 100 = 540 unoccupied working beds.
6. During the flu season, 35 new patients are admitted each day. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions is 35 × 14 = 490.
7. After these admissions, the total number of occupied working beds becomes 100 (initial) + 490 (new) = 590.

If the cupcake cost ₺10 and the orange pie cost ₺22, how much was Andre's average daily earning?",980.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. On Monday, Andre sold 24 cupcake boxes. His orange pie boxes on Monday were 16 fewer than on Tuesday.  
2. On Tuesday, he sold 11 more cupcake boxes than Monday, so he sold 24 + 11 = 35 cupcake boxes; and he sold 28 orange pie boxes.  
3. Since Monday’s orange pie boxes were 16 fewer than Tuesday’s, on Monday he sold 28 - 16 = 12 orange pie boxes.

4. On Wednesday, he sold as many boxes as he did on Monday and Tuesday combined.  
  • Cupcake boxes on Wednesday = 24 (Monday) + 35 (Tuesday) = 59  
  • Orange pie boxes on Wednesday = 12 (Monday) + 28 (Tuesday) = 40

5. Next, calculate the earnings for each day using the costs: cupcake costs ₺10 and orange pie costs ₺22.
  • Monday’s earnings = (24 × ₺10) + (12 × ₺22) = ₺240 + ₺264 = ₺504  
  • Tuesday’s earnings = (35 × ₺10) + (28 × ₺22) = ₺350 + ₺616 = ₺966  
  • Wednesday’s earnings = (59 × ₺10) + (40 × ₺22) = ₺590 + ₺880 = ₺1470

1. Dr. Lee’s class has 125 students.  
2. First, we are told that 24% of the class are volleyball players.  
  – Number of volleyball players = 24% of 125 = 0.24 × 125 = 30.  
3. Out of these 30 volleyball players, half are absent due to sickness.  
  – So, the present volleyball players = 30 ÷ 2 = 15.  
4. Next, we consider the remaining students.  
  – Remaining students = 125 − 30 = 95.  
5. Out of these 95 students, 40% are robotics club members or part of choir members. These actually form two separate groups (robotics and choir).  
  – Total students in the robotics and choir categories = 40% of 95 = 0.40 × 95 = 38.  
  – Since the problem speaks of three groups (volleyball, robotics, and choir), it is natural to split these 38 equally into two groups:

However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a €5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Mei spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",22.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, we determine how many plants can fit in a 143‑foot long flower bed. Each plant must have a separation of 13 feet to include its 3‑foot width. This means that if the first plant is placed at the beginning, then each additional plant must start 13 feet later. Thus, the total length required for n plants is:
  Total length = 3 + (n – 1) × 13

2. We set up the inequality so that the plants fit within 143 feet:
  3 + (n – 1) × 13 ≤ 143

3. Subtract 3 from both sides:
  (n – 1) × 13 ≤ 140

4. Divide both sides by 13:
  n – 1 ≤ 140 / 13 ≈ 10.77
Since n must be an integer, the maximum value for n – 1 is 10. Thus, n = 10 + 1 = 11 plants can fit.

5. Mei already owns 8 plants. Therefore, she needs to buy:
  11 (total needed) – 8 (already owned) = 3 plants

6. At the store, each plant costs €9. So without any discount, 3 plants would cost:
  3 × €9 = €27

7. However, the store offers a €5 discount on the entire purchase if more than 2 plants are bought. Since Mei is buying 3 plants, she qualifies for the discount. Thus, the final price becomes:

1. We’re told that Comet Halley appears every 53 years.
2. Liam’s uncle saw the comet when he was 31 years old.
3. Liam saw the comet for the second time when he was two times as old as his uncle was when he first saw it. That means Liam’s age at his second sighting was 2 × 31 = 62.
4. Because the comet appears 53 years apart, Liam’s first sighting must have been 53 years before his second. So, his first sighting occurred when he was 62 − 53 = 9 years old.
5. Notice that at the time of Liam’s first sighting (when he was 9), his uncle was making his first sighting at age 31. This means that when Liam was 9, his uncle was 31.

On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-kilometer walk, in minutes?",75.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Originally, let Olivia's speed on the beach be v (in kilometers per hour). According to the problem, on the sidewalk she walks at four times her beach speed, so her original sidewalk speed is 4v.

2. Due to her injury, her walking speeds drop to half their original values. This means:
  • Effective beach speed = v/2
  • Effective sidewalk speed = 4v/2 = 2v

3. Olivia spends 60 minutes (which is 1 hour) on the beach to cover 10 km. Using the formula time = distance ÷ speed, for the beach we set up the equation:
  10 km = (v/2) × 1 hour
  Solving for v:
   v/2 = 10 km/h, so v = 20 km/h

4. Now, her effective sidewalk speed is 2v = 2 × 20 km/h = 40 km/h. To cover the 10 km on the sidewalk, the time required is:
  Time = 10 km ÷ 40 km/h = 0.25 hours = 15 minutes

5. Finally, the total walking time is the sum of the beach time and the sidewalk time:
  Total time = 60 minutes + 15 minutes = 75 minutes

1. First, determine the total number of days in 10 weeks:
   10 weeks × 7 days per week = 70 days.

2. For the first 57 days, Arjun eats 3 pancakes per day.
   Pancakes eaten in this period = 57 × 3 = 171 pancakes.

3. The remaining days = 70 - 57 = 13 days.
   For these 13 days, he eats 9 pancakes per day.
   Pancakes eaten in this period = 13 × 9 = 117 pancakes.

4. Now, add the pancakes from both periods:
   Total pancakes = 171 + 117 = 288 pancakes.

5. Since 1 dozen equals 12 pancakes, determine the number of dozens:
   Dozens of pancakes = 288 ÷ 12 = 24 dozens.

Noah finds half as many as Winnie, and Oscar finds four dozen eggs more than Tara and James combined. How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?",12.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Esteban hid 11 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the total number of eggs is 11 × 12 = 132 eggs.
2. James finds 4 eggs.
3. Tara finds five times as many as James, so she finds 5 × 4 = 20 eggs.
4. Winnie finds 4 less than Tara, so she finds 20 − 4 = 16 eggs.
5. Noah finds half as many as Winnie, so he finds 16 ÷ 2 = 8 eggs.
6. Oscar finds four dozen eggs more than the combined total of Tara and James. First, Tara and James together find 20 + 4 = 24 eggs. Four dozen equals 4 × 12 = 48 eggs, so Oscar finds 24 + 48 = 72 eggs.
7. Now, add all the eggs found: 4 (James) + 20 (Tara) + 16 (Winnie) + 8 (Noah) + 72 (Oscar) = 120 eggs.
8. Finally, subtract the eggs found from the total eggs: 132 − 120 = 12 eggs still hidden.

Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each place and he gets paid ¥0.45 per collection for each apartment. He also earns 14% on tips. How much money does he make in a week?,1539.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, determine the number of apartments:
   • The first 2 complexes have 300 apartments each, so together they have 300 + 300 = 600 apartments.
   • The last complex is 50% bigger than the other two combined. That means it has 600 + 0.5 × 600 = 600 + 300 = 900 apartments.
   • Total apartments across all complexes = 600 + 900 = 1500.

2. Next, calculate the number of collections per week:
   • Oliver collects garbage 2 times a week from each apartment.
   • Total collections in one week = 1500 apartments × 2 collections = 3000 collections.

3. Now, compute his base earnings from collections:
   • He earns ¥0.45 per collection.
   • Base earnings = 3000 collections × ¥0.45 = ¥1350.

4. Finally, calculate his extra earnings from tips:
   • He earns an additional 14% on his base pay as tips.
   • Tip earnings = 14% of ¥1350 = 0.14 × ¥1350 = ¥189.

5. Total weekly earnings:
   • Total earnings = Base earnings + Tip earnings = ¥1350 + ¥189 = ¥1539.

Leilani ate 3 slices.
Her sister ate 12 more than Leilani, so she ate 3 + 12 = 15 slices.
Her brother ate 3 more than her sister, so he ate 15 + 3 = 18 slices.
Altogether, they ate 3 + 15 + 18 = 36 slices.

If they work for 6 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?",60.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The worker needs to clean 180 floors in 10 days. That means on average, they must clean 180 / 10 = 18 floors per day.

2. Originally, it takes 6 minutes per floor. But due to the injury, it now takes twice as long, which is 6 * 2 = 12 minutes per floor.

3. The time spent cleaning floors each day is 18 floors * 12 minutes per floor = 216 minutes.

Alejandro gives 1/5 of the made popcorns to his brother Tariq. How many pieces of popcorn does Alejandro have to eat?",756.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. In the first 22 seconds, 90 kernels pop.

2. In the next 22 seconds, the popping rate is 3 times as many as the first period. So, 3 × 90 = 270 kernels pop.

3. In the following 22 seconds, the rate increases to 4 times the initial rate. So, 4 × 90 = 360 kernels pop.

4. In the final 22 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate of the previous period. The previous period had 360 kernels popping, so half of that is 360 / 2 = 180 kernels.

5. After taking the pot off the heat, an additional quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds pop from the residual heat. That is 1/4 × 180 = 45 kernels.

There are 4 green cubes.
There are five times as many black cubes, so there are 5 × 4 = 20 black cubes.
Let the number of white cubes be W.
The total number of cubes is 40, so:
4 (green) + 20 (black) + W (white) = 40.
That means W = 40 - (4 + 20) = 40 - 24 = 16 white cubes.
To find the percentage of cubes that are white:
