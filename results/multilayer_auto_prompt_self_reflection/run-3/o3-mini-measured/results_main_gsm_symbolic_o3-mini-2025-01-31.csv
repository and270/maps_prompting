1. You start with 20 liters of peach drink, which is 1/5 water. However, you spill 5 liters of this drink, so only 20 - 5 = 15 liters remain.
2. Now, calculate the water in the remaining peach drink: 15 liters × (1/5) = 3 liters of water.
3. You also have 16 liters of lemon drink, which is 1/4 water. Calculate the water in the lemon drink: 16 liters × (1/4) = 4 liters of water.

If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 6 hours if she spends 2/4 of the time running and three-sixths of the time walking?",36.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Let Jasmine's walking speed be x miles per hour.
2. Since she can run 5 times faster than she can walk, her running speed is 5x mph.
3. She can skip at a rate that is 3/5 as fast as she can run, so her skip speed is (3/5) × (5x) = 3x mph.
4. We are given that her skip speed is 6 mph, so we set 3x = 6. Solving for x gives x = 2 mph.
5. Therefore, her walking speed is 2 mph and her running speed is 5 × 2 = 10 mph.
6. The problem states she spends 2/4 (which simplifies to 1/2) of her 6-hour time running and 3/6 (which also simplifies to 1/2) of the time walking.
7. This means she runs for 1/2 × 6 = 3 hours and walks for 1/2 × 6 = 3 hours.
8. While running, she covers 10 mph × 3 hours = 30 miles.
9. While walking, she covers 2 mph × 3 hours = 6 miles.

If a 300 ounces bag has 5 servings, how many ounces can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2360 and you have already consumed 1700 calories?",144.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. A serving of bread has 275 calories and there are 5 servings in a 300‑ounce bag.  
   So, the total calories in the bag are 5 × 275 = 1375 calories.

2. Since the bag weighs 300 ounces, the calories per ounce are 1375 ÷ 300 ≈ 4.5833 calories per ounce.

3. Your daily calorie target is 2360 calories and you have already consumed 1700 calories.  
   The remaining calories you can consume are 2360 − 1700 = 660 calories.

4. To find out how many ounces you can eat with 660 calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per ounce.  
   That is, ounces = 660 ÷ (1375 ÷ 300) = 660 × (300 ÷ 1375).

1. First, we find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. On a six-sided die, the numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. That makes 3 favorable outcomes out of 6, so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2, or 50%.

2. Next, we find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. For one roll, the probability of an even number is 3/6 = 1/2. Since the rolls are independent, the probability for two consecutive even rolls is (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4, or 25%.

3. Now, we compare the two probabilities to determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50%, and the probability of rolling two even numbers is 25%. The difference in probability is 50% - 25% = 25%. To find how much more likely this is relative to the 25% chance, we compute (50% / 25%) = 2.

1. Umar originally has pen pals with 9 people. He stopped corresponding with 3 of them, so he now has 9 - 3 = 6 pen pals.

Find the combined total of the number of plums and bananas Wei has in the house?",465.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Initially, Wei’s house has bananas and plums in a fixed ratio. There are ten times as many plums as bananas.
  • We’re told that he has 38 bananas.
  • Therefore, the number of plums initially is 10 × 38 = 380.

2. Next, Wei goes to the store.
  • At the store, he buys 46 more bananas.
   – So his new banana total becomes 38 + 46 = 84.
  • Also at the store, he buys plums. The number of plums he buys is stated to be 45 fewer than the number of bananas he buys.
   – Since he bought 46 bananas, he buys 46 – 45 = 1 plum.

3. Now, add the new fruits to his original stock.
  • Total bananas = original 38 + 46 (bought) = 84.
  • Total plums = original 380 + 1 (bought) = 381.

She also bought a mixed bag of sand dollars for ¥11.5 and 17 postcards that were ¥20.5 each. How much money does Sofia have left?",427.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Fudge Purchase:
   • The sale offer is: Buy 16 kg at ¥21 per kg and get up to 5 kg at 2/3 off.
   • Normal price per kg = ¥21.
   • For the discounted kg, 2/3 off means she pays only 1/3 of ¥21, which is 1/3 × 21 = ¥7 per kg.
   • Sofia scooped 23 kg in total.
   • Following the offer:
     ▪ The first 16 kg are at full price: 16 × ¥21 = ¥336.
     ▪ Next, she can get 5 kg at the discounted price: 5 × ¥7 = ¥35.
     ▪ The offer covers 16 + 5 = 21 kg. Since she bought 23 kg, the remaining 2 kg are charged at the full price: 2 × ¥21 = ¥42.
   • Total cost for the fudge = ¥336 + ¥35 + ¥42 = ¥413.

2. Sand Dollars Purchase:
   • She bought 1 mixed bag for ¥11.5.

3. Postcards Purchase:
   • She bought 17 postcards at ¥20.5 each.
   • Total cost for postcards = 17 × ¥20.5 = (17×20) + (17×0.5) = ¥340 + ¥8.5 = ¥348.5.

4. Total Spending:
   • Total spending = Cost of fudge + Cost of sand dollars + Cost of postcards
   • Total spending = ¥413 + ¥11.5 + ¥348.5 = ¥773.

1. The vending machine prices are given in cents. Since 100 cents usually equal 1 franc, we can convert the prices into francs:
  • Popcorn costs 25 cents = ₣0.25.
  • Pretzels cost 100 cents = ₣1.

2. Liam had a ₣1000 note. Although he used this note for his purchase, he received change. The change is said to be 8% of his money. Since his money was ₣1000, the change equals:
  Change = 8% of ₣1000 = 0.08 × 1000 = ₣80.

3. That means he actually spent the remainder:
  Amount spent = Total money – Change = 1000 – 80 = ₣920.

4. His purchase consisted of 4 bags of popcorn and some pretzels. First, find the cost of the popcorn:
  Cost of 4 bags of popcorn = 4 × ₣0.25 = ₣1.

5. Let the number of pretzels he bought be x. Since each pretzel costs ₣1, the cost for the pretzels is ₣x. The total cost of the items is then:
  Total cost = Cost of popcorn + Cost of pretzels = 1 + x.

6. We know he spent ₣920, so we can write:

1. Nadia's dog has 1000 puppies and Mateo's dog has 550 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is 1000 + 550 = 1550.

   (310 / 1550) * 100.
4. Simplifying the fraction: 310/1550 = 31/155, and since 31 goes into 155 exactly 5 times (155 = 31 * 5), the fraction equals 1/5 which is 0.2.

1. On Friday:
   - Oscar sold 29 boxes of brownies.
   - The number of kiwi pies sold on Friday is 12 boxes fewer than the number sold on Saturday.

2. On Saturday:
   - He sold 11 more boxes of brownies than on Friday, which is 29 + 11 = 40 boxes.
   - He sold 26 boxes of kiwi pies.

3. Now, determine the number of kiwi pies sold on Friday:
   - Since Saturday sales of kiwi pies were 26, Friday sales were 26 - 12 = 14 boxes.

4. Next, calculate the earnings for each day:
   - The price per box of brownie is ¥11.
   - The price per box of kiwi pie is ¥27.

Each flowering plant costs ¥3 at the store, how much money will Kimia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",3.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Kimia needs to plant her flower bed by placing plants along a 180‑foot row. Each grown plant is 3 feet wide, and to allow for proper spacing the rule is to leave 15.0 feet between adjacent plants.
2. When planting in a row, if there are n plants the pattern is: one plant (3 feet wide), then a 15‑foot gap, then another plant (3 feet), then a 15‑foot gap, and so on. Notice that there is a gap between every pair of adjacent plants (and no extra gap is needed after the last plant). Thus the total length covered by n plants is  
  Total length = (n × plant width) + [(n – 1) × gap]  
         = 3n + 15(n – 1)
3. To fill the 180‑foot flower bed without exceeding its length, we must have  
  3n + 15(n – 1) ≤ 180.
4. Expanding and simplifying:  
  3n + 15n – 15 ≤ 180  
  18n – 15 ≤ 180  
  18n ≤ 195  
  n ≤ 195/18  
  n ≤ 10.833…  
 Since n must be a whole number (you cannot plant a fraction of a flower), the maximum number of plants that can be planted is 10.
5. Kimia already owns 11 flowering plants. To “fill up” her flower bed properly (i.e. planting 10 plants with the required spacing), she has more than enough plants. In fact, she does not need to purchase any new plants.

1. Let v be Emma's walking speed on the beach (in miles per minute). Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 4v.
2. Emma covers 11 miles on the beach. The time taken on the beach is given by 11/v minutes. According to the problem, she spends 66 minutes on the beach, so we have:
  11/v = 66
  v = 11/66 = 1/6 miles per minute.

Winnie eats 4 eggs a day for 60 days. So, in the first phase:
4 eggs/day × 60 days = 240 eggs.

Then, Winnie increases her consumption to 5 eggs a day for 96 days. So, in the second phase:
5 eggs/day × 96 days = 480 eggs.

Adding both phases together:
240 eggs + 480 eggs = 720 eggs.

Tariq hid 9 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, he hid 9 × 12 = 108 eggs in total.

Noah finds 5 eggs.

Emma finds four times as many as Noah, so she finds 4 × 5 = 20 eggs.

Olivia finds 2 less than Emma, so she finds 20 - 2 = 18 eggs.

Alejandro finds half as many as Olivia, so he finds ½ × 18 = 9 eggs.

Now, add up all the eggs that were found:
5 (Noah) + 20 (Emma) + 18 (Olivia) + 9 (Alejandro) = 52 eggs found.

Ali collects garbage 3 times a week from each place and he gets paid €0.4 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?,2538.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.
1. The first 3 apartment complexes have 300 apartments each. So, the total for these is 3 * 300 = 900 apartments.
2. The last apartment complex is 35% bigger than these 900 apartments. To find 35% of 900, we calculate 0.35 * 900 = 315. So, the last complex has 900 + 315 = 1215 apartments.
3. In total, all 4 complexes have 900 + 1215 = 2115 apartments.
4. Ali collects garbage 3 times a week per apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is 2115 * 3 = 6345.

1. First, determine the total cleaning time for all rooms. Each room takes 15 minutes, so for 110 rooms the total time is 110 × 15 = 1650 minutes.
2. The hospital is cleaned over 5 days, and each day the cleaner works 11 hours. Since 11 hours equals 11 × 60 = 660 minutes, the total working minutes over 5 days is 5 × 660 = 3300 minutes.
3. To find out how much time is spent cleaning on an average day, divide the total cleaning time by 5. That is, 1650 ÷ 5 = 330 minutes per day.
4. Now, calculate what percentage of each day is spent cleaning by comparing the cleaning time per day (330 minutes) to the total work minutes per day (660 minutes).

1. Ali begins with 96 marbles.
2. He drops three-sixths (which is equal to 1/2) of them. That means he drops 96 × (3/6) = 48 marbles.
3. The marbles that were not dropped remain with him. That number is 96 - 48 = 48.
4. Out of the dropped marbles, he only recovers 18.
