After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.
1. First, determine the original total cost before the discount. The final total after a 20% discount is $1500, which means this amount is 80% of the original price. Thus, the original total cost is 1500 / 0.8 = $1875.
2. Next, calculate the cost for the donuts and mini cupcakes.
 • Sophia bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen. Since 60 donuts make 5 dozens (because 60 ÷ 12 = 5), the cost for donuts is 5 × 19 = $95.
 • She also bought 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen. Similarly, 60 cupcakes equal 5 dozens, so their cost is 5 × 33 = $165.
3. Let the cost per dozen for mini cheesecakes be x dollars. She bought 60 mini cheesecakes, which is also 5 dozens, so their cost is 5x dollars.
4. The sum of all three items before the discount is:
  95 + 165 + 5x = 1875.
  Combine 95 and 165 to get 260, so:
  260 + 5x = 1875.
5. Solve for x:
  5x = 1875 - 260 = 1615,
  x = 1615 / 5 = 323.
6. Therefore, the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is $323.",323.0,1
p2,gsm-symbolic,o3-mini-2025-01-31,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving. A 300 grams bag has 6 servings. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?",350.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, determine the total calories in a 300‑gram bag of popcorn.  
 • A serving is 200 calories, and there are 6 servings.  
 • Total calories in the bag = 6 × 200 = 1200 calories.

2. Now, find the calorie content per gram of popcorn.  
 • Calories per gram = 1200 calories / 300 grams = 4 calories per gram.

3. Calculate each person’s healthy daily calorie target.  
 • The target is 15 calories per pound.  
 • Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, so his target = 220 × 15 = 3300 calories.  
 • Tara weighs 140 lbs, so her target = 140 × 15 = 2100 calories.

4. Determine how many calories each person still needs to reach their target.  
 For Hiroshi:  
  – He has already consumed 1100 calories in food.  
  – He burned 200 calories through exercise, so his net consumption is 1100 − 200 = 900 calories.  
  – Calories needed = 3300 − 900 = 2400 calories.  
 For Tara:  
  – She has already consumed 900 calories in food and 200 calories from ice cream, so her total consumption = 900 + 200 = 1100 calories.  
  – Calories needed = 2100 − 1100 = 1000 calories.

5. Convert the additional calories needed into grams of popcorn (using 4 calories per gram).  
 For Hiroshi:  
  – Grams of popcorn needed = 2400 calories / 4 calories per gram = 600 grams.  
 For Tara:  
  – Grams of popcorn needed = 1000 calories / 4 calories per gram = 250 grams.

6. Finally, find the difference in grams needed between Hiroshi and Tara.  
 • Difference = 600 grams − 250 grams = 350 grams.

She already has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges of her large country home. She also purchased 200 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Daphne remain with?",335.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Daphne has 8 plants on each of her 56 window ledges, which gives a total of 56 × 8 = 448 plants.
2. Two days ago, she received an additional 23 potted plants, so now she has 448 + 23 = 471 plants.
3. Yesterday, she purchased 200 new plants, adding up to 471 + 200 = 671 plants.

However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.
1. The city is 80 miles wide, so 1/4 of the city is 80/4 = 20 miles.
2. For the first hour (60 minutes), the fog bank covers every 4 miles at full speed.
   - In 60 minutes, it covers 4 miles.
3. After 60 minutes, the wind speed is halved. This reduces the covering rate to half of the original, so the fog bank will now cover 4/2 = 2 miles in 60 minutes.
4. After the first 60 minutes, the remaining distance to cover out of 20 miles is 20 - 4 = 16 miles.
5. At a rate of 2 miles per hour (which is 2 miles in 60 minutes), covering 16 miles will take 16 / 2 = 8 hours. In minutes, that's 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.
6. Adding the initial 60 minutes to the 480 minutes required later gives a total time of 60 + 480 = 540 minutes.

On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 2-hour episodes. On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?",6.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Convert the total TV time to minutes. Since Santiago watched 20 hours of TV, and 1 hour = 60 minutes:
  20 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 1200 minutes.

2. Calculate the minutes spent on other days:
 • On Tuesday and Wednesday, he watched 4-hour episodes each night.
  4 hours = 4 × 60 = 240 minutes per episode.
  So, Tuesday and Wednesday together: 240 + 240 = 480 minutes.
 • On Friday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show.
  3 hours = 3 × 60 = 180 minutes.
  Thus, Friday = 180 + 45 = 225 minutes.
 • On Saturday, he watched three 2-hour episodes.
  2 hours = 2 × 60 = 120 minutes per episode.
  So, Saturday = 3 × 120 = 360 minutes.
 • On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each lasting 15 minutes.
  Sunday = 3 × 15 = 45 minutes.

3. Add the minutes from Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:
  480 + 225 + 360 + 45 = 1110 minutes.

4. Determine the minutes of TV watched on Thursday:

She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, and uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Nia makes tea with teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio 54:27. This ratio simplifies to 2:1, meaning she uses 2 teaspoons of sugar for every 1 cup of water. If we let S represent the teaspoons of sugar and W represent the cups of water, then:
   S : W = 2 : 1, so S = 2W or equivalently, W = S/2.

2. Next, she uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water. This tells us the ratio of milk to water is 1:1, so if we let M be the tablespoons of milk, then:
   M = W = S/2.

3. Finally, she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. Let C be the tablespoons of cream. Then:
   C = 2S.

4. According to the problem, she used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. So, the sum is:
   S (sugar) + W (water) + M (milk) + C (cream) = 240.

5. Substituting the expressions in terms of S into the equation:
   S + (S/2) + (S/2) + (2S) = 240.

6. Combine like terms:
   S + (S/2 + S/2) = S + S = 2S, and then adding 2S gives:
   2S + 2S = 4S.
   So, 4S = 240.

1. Let x be the number of forks in the package that Aisha bought.
2. After buying her package, Aisha had x forks.
3. Her husband then gave her an additional 8 forks, so now she had x + 8 forks.
4. While preparing the stuffed peppers, she used 16 forks, which left her with (x + 8) - 16 = x - 8 forks.
5. Then she threw away 6 defective forks, so she was left with (x - 8) - 6 = x - 14 forks.
6. The guests brought 2 packs of forks with 6 forks in each pack, adding 2 * 6 = 12 forks. This increased her total to (x - 14) + 12 = x - 2 forks.

In the span of two years, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?",1764.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Banana Field:
   • Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field.
   • The yield is given as 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard.
   • To find the yield per one square yard, divide 36 by 4/5:
     36 ÷ (4/5) = 36 × (5/4) = 45 bananas per square yard.
   • So, in one harvest, the banana field produces:
     10 square yards × 45 bananas/sq yard = 450 bananas.

2. Apricot Field:
   • Ravi has a 13-square yard apricot field.
   • The yield is 12 apricots per square yard.
   • So, in one harvest, the apricot field produces:
     13 square yards × 12 apricots/sq yard = 156 apricots.

3. Harvest Frequency over Two Years:
   • Both banana and apricot fields can be harvested every 4 months.
   • There are 24 months in two years.
   • Number of harvests = 24 ÷ 4 = 6 harvests.

4. Total Production Over Two Years:
   • Total bananas harvested = 450 bananas/harvest × 6 harvests = 2700 bananas.
   • Total apricots harvested = 156 apricots/harvest × 6 harvests = 936 apricots.

What is the least amount Arjun can spend on everything?",212.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, we calculate the cost of each item:
   • Folders: 12 folders at $4.75 each cost 12 × 4.75 = $57.
   • Erasers: 8 erasers at $14.5 each cost 8 × 14.5 = $116.
   • Bond paper: 1 ream costs $11.
   • Pencils: 7 pencils at $8 each cost 7 × 8 = $56.

2. Next, we add these up to get the total cost before any discounts:
   Total cost = $57 + $116 + $11 + $56 = $240.

3. Now, we consider the first option: becoming a member.
   • With membership, Arjun must pay a one-time fee of $20.
   • He then gets a 20% discount on the $240 purchase. The discounted purchase cost is 80% of $240, which is 0.80 × $240 = $192.

1. For the first event, Yusuf rolls a number greater than 5. On a twenty-sided die, the numbers greater than 5 are 6, 7, ... up to 20. That gives 15 possible outcomes out of 20. So, the probability for one roll is 15/20 = 0.75 (or 75%).
2. Rolling this outcome twice in a row, the probability becomes (0.75)² = 0.5625, which is 56.25%.
3. For the second event, Yusuf needs to roll an even number. There are 10 even numbers on a twenty-sided die (2, 4, 6, ..., 20), so the probability for one roll is 10/20 = 0.5 (or 50%).
4. Rolling an even number four times in a row, the probability is (0.5)⁴ = 0.0625, which is 6.25%.

3. Priya scoops up 21 kgs of fudge. Under the offer:
   - She must pay full price for the first 15 kgs:
     • Cost = 15 kgs × ₺22 per kg = ₺330.
   - The offer gives a discount on 4 kgs. A discount of 1/4 off means she pays 75% of the price:
     • Discounted price per kg = 22 × ¾ = ₺16.50.
     • Cost for 4 kgs = 4 × ₺16.50 = ₺66.
   - She scoops a total of 21 kgs, which is 15 + 4 already accounted for = 19 kgs. The remaining 2 kgs (because 21 − 19 = 2) are not covered by the discount, so they are charged at full price:

After a visit to the vet, Jamal discovered that half of his unspotted puppies actually have spots that were not visible before. What percentage of all the puppies have spots?",90.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Jamal's dog has a total of 131 puppies:
   - Initially, 23 puppies have spots.
   - The number of unspotted puppies is 131 - 23 = 108.
   - After the vet's visit, half of these unspotted puppies are recognized as having spots. That adds 108 / 2 = 54 spotted puppies.
   - So, the total spotted puppies from Jamal's dog become 23 + 54 = 77.

2. Gabriel's dog has 47 puppies:
   - Out of these, 13 have spots.

3. Yuki has 54 dogs, and each dog has 13 puppies that have spots:
   - This contributes 54 * 13 = 702 spotted puppies.
   - (We're assuming that only these puppies are counted since the problem specifies that each has 13 puppies with spots.)

4. Now, let's calculate the total number of puppies:
   - Jamal's puppies: 131
   - Gabriel's puppies: 47
   - Yuki's puppies: 702
   - Total puppies = 131 + 47 + 702 = 880

5. Calculate the total number of spotted puppies:
   - Jamal's spotted puppies: 77
   - Gabriel's spotted puppies: 13
   - Yuki's spotted puppies: 702
   - Total spotted = 77 + 13 + 702 = 792

6. Now, find the percentage of spotted puppies:
   - Percentage = (Total spotted puppies / Total puppies) * 100
   - Percentage = (792 / 880) * 100 = 0.9 * 100 = 90%

Since apples are a rare treat, he only buys four 3-kg boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys twelve 6-kg bags. Hay are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys thirty four 39-kg packs. Corn are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 17-kg sacks. Finally, he buys 43 kgs of groceries, and 27 kgs of tools, and 100 kgs of wood. A farm truck can carry 160 kgs at a time. If the farmer has three trucks, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the purchased items?",4.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, compute the weight for each item:
   - Apples: 4 boxes × 3 kg = 12 kg.
   - Cucumbers: 12 bags × 6 kg = 72 kg.
   - Hay: 34 packs × 39 kg = 1326 kg.
   - Corn: 20 sacks × 17 kg = 340 kg.
   - Groceries: 43 kg.
   - Tools: 27 kg.
   - Wood: 100 kg.

2. Next, calculate the total weight:
   - Total weight = 12 + 72 + 1326 + 340 + 43 + 27 + 100 = 1920 kg.

3. Each truck can carry 160 kg, and the farmer has 3 trucks. So, the total carrying capacity per trip is:
   - 3 trucks × 160 kg = 480 kg per trip.

4. Finally, determine the number of trips required to transport 1920 kg:

On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?",45.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. For the first shark:
   - The shark is 40 feet long. Converting feet to inches: 40 feet × 12 inches/foot = 480 inches.
   - Originally, there are 18 remoras, each 16 inches long. So, the total length of all remoras is 18 × 16 = 288 inches.
   - However, 1/6 of the remoras swam away. Since 1/6 of 18 is 3, the remaining remoras are 18 − 3 = 15.
   - The combined length of the remaining remoras is 15 × 16 = 240 inches.
   - The percentage of the shark's body length covered by remoras is (240 inches ÷ 480 inches) × 100 = 50%.

2. For the second shark:
   - The shark is 10 feet long. Converting to inches: 10 feet × 12 inches/foot = 120 inches.
   - There are 6 remoras, each 8 inches long. Their total length is 6 × 8 = 48 inches.
   - The percentage of the shark's body length covered by remoras is (48 inches ÷ 120 inches) × 100 = 40%.

1. Each bowl holds 24 almonds.
2. Each table holds three times that, so each table holds 3 × 24 = 72 almonds.
3. Initially, Carlos has 7 bowls and 3 tables. However, 2 tables break, leaving him with only 1 working table.
4. The working table can hold 72 almonds, and the 7 bowls can hold 7 × 24 = 168 almonds. So, the total capacity with the remaining containers is 72 + 168 = 240 almonds.

1. Diego is currently 19 years old.

2. In 9 years, Aisha will be 2 times Diego’s current age. Since Diego is 19, 2 × 19 = 38. So, in 9 years, Aisha will be 38 years old. Her current age is 38 − 9 = 29.

3. Diego’s brother, Esteban, is 6 years younger than Diego. So, Esteban’s current age is 19 − 6 = 13.

1. For each grandchild, Keisha knits the following items:
 • Shawl: 5 skeins  
 • Sweater: 6 skeins  
 • Poncho: 8 skeins  
 • Gloves: 8 skeins  
 • Mittens: 14 skeins  

2. First, we add these to find the total skeins needed per grandchild:  
 5 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 14 = 41 skeins per grandchild.

3. Keisha has 4 grandchildren, so for all of them she needs:  
 41 skeins/child × 4 children = 164 skeins.

4. In addition, she wants to knit two warm jackets for herself, with each jacket requiring 8 skeins:  
 2 jackets × 8 skeins/jacket = 16 skeins.

5. Total skeins required is the sum for her grandchildren and for herself:  
 164 skeins + 16 skeins = 180 skeins.

6. The wool is sold by the dozen, and one dozen skeins costs $7.  
 Since 1 dozen = 12 skeins, we first calculate the number of dozens needed:  
 180 skeins ÷ 12 skeins/dozen = 15 dozens.  
 So, the cost before any discount is:  
 15 dozens × $7/dozen = $105.

7. The store promotion gives a $20 discount on purchases over $100. Since $105 is over $100, Keisha qualifies for the discount.

The store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs; any additional rice is sold at the regular price. Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2. How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Mohammed uses 3 kgs of rice per day for 7 days, so he needs a total of 3 × 7 = 21 kgs of rice.

2. The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg, but since the available brand is 20% more expensive, its price per kg is 15 × 1.20 = ¥18.

3. The store offers a 40% discount on up to 10 kgs of rice. This means the discounted price per kg is 60% of ¥18, which is 18 × 0.60 = ¥10.8 per kg. The remaining rice (21 - 10 = 11 kgs) is sold at the regular price of ¥18 per kg.

4. The cost for the first 10 kgs is 10 × ¥10.8 = ¥108.

5. The cost for the remaining 11 kgs is 11 × ¥18 = ¥198.

6. The total cost for the rice is ¥108 + ¥198 = ¥306.

How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. After 6 weeks, Jasmine has 36 signatures and Mia has 31, so together they have 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

2. Their goal is to have 145 signatures in total by the end of spring break. This means they need an additional 145 - 67 = 78 signatures in the remaining 2 weeks.

3. During the next 2 weeks, Jasmine’s weekend-only collecting reduces her usual weekly total by 5. We can find her usual weekly collection by dividing her 6-week total by 6. That is, Jasmine’s weekly collection is 36 / 6 = 6 signatures.

4. With the reduction, Jasmine will collect 6 - 5 = 1 signature per week for the remaining 2 weeks. Over 2 weeks, she collects 2 x 1 = 2 signatures.

5. Since the sisters need 78 more signatures and Jasmine will contribute 2, Mia must collect the rest. That is, Mia needs to collect 78 - 2 = 76 signatures over the next 2 weeks.

Leon starts with 312 ounces of water.

1. He makes 10 giant cubes, each using 12 ounces.  
  Amount used for giant cubes = 10 × 12 = 120 ounces.

2. He makes 12 medium cubes, each using 5 ounces.  
  Amount used for medium cubes = 12 × 5 = 60 ounces.

3. He makes 14 small cubes, each using ½ ounce.  
  Amount used for small cubes = 14 × ½ = 7 ounces.

How much more money does Elena have left than Jamal after they leave the store?",8.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

Step 1: Calculate Elena's total cost.
• Anchors: 15 anchors at $0.26 each cost 15 × 0.26 = $3.90.
• Nails: 9 nails at $0.61 each cost 9 × 0.61 = $5.49.
• Paint: Since Elena is not a member, she pays full price for 10 gallons at $7.00 each, which costs 10 × 7.00 = $70.00.
• Total cost for Elena = $3.90 + $5.49 + $70.00 = $79.39.

Step 2: Calculate how much money Elena has left.
• Elena starts with $98.39.
• Money left = $98.39 − $79.39 = $19.00.

Step 3: Calculate Jamal's total cost.
• Paint: Jamal is a member so he gets a 10% discount on paint. The full price is $7.00 each, so after a 10% discount the price becomes 7.00 − (10% of 7.00) = 7.00 − 0.70 = $6.30 per gallon. For 10 gallons, the cost is 10 × $6.30 = $63.00.
• Carpenter pencils: 3 pencils at $2 each cost 3 × $2 = $6.00.
• Total cost for Jamal = $63.00 + $6.00 = $69.00.

1. The cake has a total of 120 pieces.
2. Arash eats 5 pieces per day.
3. Ava eats twice as much as Arash, so she eats 5 * 2 = 10 pieces per day.
4. DeShawn eats two times as much as Ava, so he eats 10 * 2 = 20 pieces per day.

For the first 2 days:
5. In each day, the total eaten is 5 (Arash) + 10 (Ava) + 20 (DeShawn) = 35 pieces.

Due to the pandemic, 20 patients are admitted into the care facility each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks.",530.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.
1. The care facility has a total of 1900 rooms.
2. Initially, 1/4 of the rooms are occupied. That is, 1900 / 4 = 475 rooms are occupied.
3. Also, 1/4 of the rooms are out of service. That is, 1900 / 4 = 475 rooms are out of service.
4. This means that initially, the number of serviceable rooms (that can be occupied) is 1900 - 475 (occupied) - 475 (out of service) = 950.
5. Due to the pandemic, 20 patients are admitted each day. Over 3 weeks (which is 21 days), the total number of new patients admitted is 20 × 21 = 420.
6. Assuming all these patients are accommodated in the serviceable rooms, the new total number of occupied rooms becomes:
  initially occupied (475) + newly admitted (420) = 895.

On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday and 21 boxes of apricot pie. On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?",796.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. On Wednesday:
   - Muffins: 27 boxes.
   - Apricot pies: He sold 13 fewer boxes than on Thursday. Since we know Thursday’s apricot pie count is given later, we will calculate it in the next step.

2. On Thursday:
   - Muffins: He sold 11 more boxes than on Wednesday. So, muffins = 27 + 11 = 38 boxes.
   - Apricot pies: 21 boxes.

3. Now, go back to Wednesday’s apricot pies:
   - Wednesday apricot pies = Thursday’s apricot pies − 13 = 21 − 13 = 8 boxes.

4. On Friday:
   - The problem states that he sold “as much as he did in the past two days combined.” This applies to each product:
     • Friday muffins = Wednesday muffins + Thursday muffins = 27 + 38 = 65 boxes.
     • Friday apricot pies = Wednesday apricot pies + Thursday apricot pies = 8 + 21 = 29 boxes.

5. Now, calculate the earnings for each day:
   - Muffin cost = ₺9 per box.
   - Apricot pie cost = ₺21 per box.

   • Wednesday’s earnings:
     - Muffins: 27 × 9 = ₺243.
     - Apricot pies: 8 × 21 = ₺168.
     - Total for Wednesday = 243 + 168 = ₺411.

   • Thursday’s earnings:
     - Muffins: 38 × 9 = ₺342.
     - Apricot pies: 21 × 21 = ₺441.
     - Total for Thursday = 342 + 441 = ₺783.

   • Friday’s earnings:
     - Muffins: 65 × 9 = ₺585.
     - Apricot pies: 29 × 21 = ₺609.
     - Total for Friday = 585 + 609 = ₺1194.

How many students are leaving early to the tournament?",66.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The class has 120 students. First, 50% of these are swimmers. That is 0.50 × 120 = 60 swimmers.

2. Out of the remaining students:
  Remaining students = 120 – 60 = 60.
  Out of these, 45% are choir members or dancers. That is 0.45 × 60 = 27 choir/dancers.

3. Notice that the 60 remaining students are divided into two groups:
  • 27 who are choir/dancers.
  • The rest, 60 – 27 = 33, who are neither choir/dancers nor swimmers.
  Thus, the three groups in the class are:
   Group 1: Swimmers (60 originally)
   Group 2: Choir/dancers (27)
   Group 3: Other non-swimmer students (33)

4. Today, all three groups are to leave early for an away tournament. However, there is a twist:
  • Half of the swimmers are absent due to sickness. So, only half of 60 swimmers are present, which gives 60 ÷ 2 = 30 swimmers available.

5. Next, additional cheerleaders will accompany the early leavers. The problem states that 3 cheerleaders will accompany each group. Since there are 3 groups, a total of 3 × 3 = 9 cheerleaders will be added.

Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.,163.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Washing: Olga takes 12 seconds per clam. For 150 clams, the total washing time is 150 × 12 seconds = 1800 seconds, which is 1800 ÷ 60 = 30 minutes.

2. Peeling: Olga can peel 6 clams per minute. To peel 150 clams, she takes 150 ÷ 6 = 25 minutes.

3. Break: After peeling, Olga takes a 13-minute break.

4. Sautéing: Olga can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes. For 150 clams, she needs 150 ÷ 30 = 5 batches. Therefore, the sautéing time is 5 × 19 = 95 minutes.

Now, adding all the steps together:
Washing (30 minutes) + Peeling (25 minutes) + Break (13 minutes) + Sautéing (95 minutes) = 30 + 25 + 13 + 95 = 163 minutes.

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 50% for the second half. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?",1755.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. First, we determine each person's daily pizza consumption before any diet.
 • The uncle eats 10 pizzas per day.
 • His spouse eats 20 pizzas per day.
 • Together, they eat 10 + 20 = 30 pizzas per day.
 • The grandchild eats two-fourths (which is ½) of the combined amount of the uncle and spouse. That is ½ × 30 = 15 pizzas per day.
 • So, the total daily consumption before the diet is 10 + 20 + 15 = 45 pizzas per day.

2. For the first month (with no diet), let’s assume a month has 30 days.
 • Total pizzas in month 1 = 45 pizzas/day × 30 days = 1350 pizzas.

3. In the second month, the family goes on a diet:
 • For the first half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by 60%. This means they consume only 40% of their usual amount.
  – Daily consumption during the first half = 45 × 0.40 = 18 pizzas.
 • For the second half of the month (the remaining 15 days), they reduce the already reduced consumption by an additional 50%. That is, they eat half of what they ate in the first half.
  – Daily consumption during the second half = 18 × 0.50 = 9 pizzas.

4. Now, calculate the total pizzas eaten in the second month.
 • First half (15 days): 15 × 18 = 270 pizzas.
 • Second half (15 days): 15 × 9 = 135 pizzas.
 • Total for month 2 = 270 + 135 = 405 pizzas.

If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?",85.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Let the normal walking speed on the beach be r miles per hour. Then, normally, Ananya’s speed on the sidewalk is 2r miles per hour.

2. Due to the injury, both speeds are halved. Thus, her injured walking speeds become:
 – On the beach: (r/2) mph.
 – On the sidewalk: (2r/2) = r mph.

3. We know that Ananya covers the 10-mile beach segment in 50 minutes. First, convert 50 minutes into hours:
 50 minutes = 50/60 = 5/6 hours.

4. Using the time and distance for the beach segment, we have:
 Distance = Speed × Time
 10 = (r/2) × (5/6)

5. Solve for r:
 (r/2) × (5/6) = 10
 Multiply both sides by 2:
 (5r)/6 = 20
 Now multiply both sides by 6:
 5r = 120
 Divide by 5:
 r = 24 mph

6. Now, determine Ananya’s injured speeds:
 – Beach: r/2 = 24/2 = 12 mph.
 – Sidewalk: r = 24 mph.

1. First, we calculate the total number of cookies Amelia initially had. Since she had 11 dozen cookies and 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, she had 11 × 12 = 132 cookies.

2. Amelia then ate 5 cookies for breakfast. So, the number of cookies left that she hid in the yard is 132 - 5 = 127 cookies.

3. Next, we determine how many cookies each friend finds:
   • Elena finds 5 cookies.
   • Mei finds twice as many as Elena. Therefore, Mei finds 2 × 5 = 10 cookies.
   • Xavier finds 2 less than Mei. So, Xavier finds 10 - 2 = 8 cookies.
   • Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier. That is, Mohammed finds 8 ÷ 8 = 1 cookie.
   • Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined. Mei and Elena together find 10 + 5 = 15 cookies. Two dozen is 24 calories, so Umar finds 15 + 24 = 39 cookies.

   Elena (5) + Mei (10) + Xavier (8) + Mohammed (1) + Umar (39) = 5 + 10 + 8 + 1 + 39 = 63 cookies.

There are 5 white bricks.  
There are twice as many orange bricks as white bricks, so there are 2 * 5 = 10 orange bricks.  
Let the number of green bricks be G.  
Since the total number of bricks is 30, we have:  
5 (white) + 10 (orange) + G (green) = 30.  
So, G = 30 - (5 + 10) = 30 - 15 = 15.  
To find the percentage of green bricks, we calculate (15/30) * 100 = 50%.  
The answer is 50%.",50.0,1

Olivia, who is younger than Bodhi but older than Keisha, will be 42 in 7 years. How much younger is Keisha than the average age of all three?",18.0,,,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. Let Olivia’s current age be O, Bodhi’s be B, and Keisha’s be K.
2. We know that Olivia and Bodhi are 24 years apart, with Olivia being younger. So, B - O = 24.
3. Also, Olivia and Keisha are 15 years apart, with Olivia being older. So, O - K = 15.
4. The problem states that in 7 years, Olivia will be 42. That means her current age is 42 - 7 = 35. So, O = 35.
5. Using O - K = 15, we can find K: 
   K = O - 15 = 35 - 15 = 20.
6. Using B - O = 24, we can find B: 
   B = O + 24 = 35 + 24 = 59.
7. Now, we calculate the average of their ages:
   Average = (O + K + B) / 3 = (35 + 20 + 59) / 3 = 114 / 3 = 38.
8. Finally, we determine how much younger Keisha is than this average:
   Difference = Average - K = 38 - 20 = 18.

The answer is 18.",18.0,1
