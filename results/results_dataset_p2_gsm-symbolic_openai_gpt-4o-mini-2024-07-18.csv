p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Sophia went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 60 donuts at $19 per dozen, 60 mini cupcakes at $33 per dozen, and 60 mini cheesecakes. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1500. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?",323.0,"To find the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen, we can start by calculating the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes that Sophia bought.

1. **Calculate the cost of the donuts:**
   - Sophia bought 60 donuts.
   - Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, the number of dozens of donuts she bought is:
     \[
     \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ dozens}
     \]
   - The cost per dozen of donuts is $19, so the total cost for the donuts is:
     \[
     5 \text{ dozens} \times 19 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 95 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:**
   - Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes.
   - The number of dozens of mini cupcakes she bought is:
     \[
     \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ dozens}
     \]
   - The cost per dozen of mini cupcakes is $33, so the total cost for the mini cupcakes is:
     \[
     5 \text{ dozens} \times 33 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 165 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   - Let \( x \) be the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen.
   - The number of dozens of mini cheesecakes she bought is:
     \[
     \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ dozens}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost for the mini cheesecakes is:
     \[
     5 \text{ dozens} \times x \text{ dollars/dozen} = 5x \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The total cost before the discount is:
     \[
     95 + 165 + 5x = 260 + 5x \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**
   - Sophia received a 20% discount on her total cost. Therefore, she paid 80% of the total cost:
     \[
     0.8 \times (260 + 5x) = 1500
     \]

5. **Set up the equation and solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   0.8(260 + 5x) = 1500
   \]
   \[
   208 + 4x = 1500
   \]
   \[
   4x = 1500 - 208
   \]
   \[
   4x = 1292
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{1292}{4} = 323
   \]

Thus, the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is \(\boxed{323}\) dollars.",323.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the donuts:**
   - Sophia bought 60 donuts.
   - Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, she bought \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $19.
   - So, the total cost for the donuts is \( 5 \times 19 = 95 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:**
   - Sophia bought 60 mini cupcakes.
   - She bought \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $33.
   - So, the total cost for the mini cupcakes is \( 5 \times 33 = 165 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   - Let \( x \) be the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen.
   - She bought 60 mini cheesecakes, which is \( \frac{60}{12} = 5 \) dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - So, the total cost for the mini cheesecakes is \( 5x \) dollars.
   - The total cost before the discount is \( 95 + 165 + 5x \).

4. **Apply the 20% discount:**
   - The total amount paid after the discount is $1500.
   - The total cost before the discount can be expressed as \( 0.8 \times (95 + 165 + 5x) = 1500 \).

5. **Set up the equation:**
   - \( 0.8 \times (260 + 5x) = 1500 \).
   - Dividing both sides by 0.8 gives:
   \[
   260 + 5x = \frac{1500}{0.8} = 1875.
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 260 from both sides:
   \[
   5x = 1875 - 260 = 1615.
   \]
   - Divide by 5:
   \[
   x = \frac{1615}{5} = 323.
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen is $323.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving. A 300 grams bag has 6 servings. The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 200 calories through exercise. Tara weighs 140 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 200 calories in ice cream. How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?",350.0,"To determine how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara, we first need to calculate their remaining calorie allowances based on their daily calorie targets and what they have already consumed.

### Step 1: Calculate Daily Calorie Target
1. **Hiroshi's Weight**: 220 lbs
   - Daily Calorie Target = 15 calories/pound × 220 lbs = 3300 calories

2. **Tara's Weight**: 140 lbs
   - Daily Calorie Target = 15 calories/pound × 140 lbs = 2100 calories

### Step 2: Calculate Remaining Calories
1. **Hiroshi's Caloric Intake**:
   - Total calories consumed = 1100 calories (food) + 200 calories (exercise burned) = 1100 - 200 = 900 calories net consumed.
   - Remaining calories = Daily Calorie Target - Net Consumed = 3300 - 900 = 2400 calories.

2. **Tara's Caloric Intake**:
   - Total calories consumed = 900 calories (food) + 200 calories (ice cream) = 1100 calories.
   - Remaining calories = Daily Calorie Target - Consumed = 2100 - 1100 = 1000 calories.

### Step 3: Calculate Popcorn Consumption
1. **Calories per Serving of Popcorn**: 200 calories
   - Each bag has 6 servings, so total calories in a bag = 200 calories/serving × 6 servings = 1200 calories per bag.
   - Each serving is 300 grams / 6 servings = 50 grams per serving.

2. **Calories per Gram of Popcorn**:
   - Calories per gram = 200 calories / 50 grams = 4 calories/gram.

### Step 4: Calculate Grams of Popcorn Needed
1. **Hiroshi's Popcorn Requirement**:
   - Remaining calories = 2400 calories.
   - Grams of popcorn needed = 2400 calories / 4 calories/gram = 600 grams.

2. **Tara's Popcorn Requirement**:
   - Remaining calories = 1000 calories.
   - Grams of popcorn needed = 1000 calories / 4 calories/gram = 250 grams.

### Step 5: Calculate the Difference in Grams of Popcorn
- Difference = Hiroshi's grams - Tara's grams = 600 grams - 250 grams = 350 grams.

### Conclusion
Hiroshi needs to consume **350 more grams of popcorn** than Tara.",350.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate Hiroshi's daily calorie target:**
   - Hiroshi weighs 220 lbs.
   - The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight.
   - So, Hiroshi's target is 220 lbs * 15 calories/lb = 3300 calories.

2. **Calculate Hiroshi's net calorie intake:**
   - Hiroshi has already consumed 1100 calories.
   - He has burned 200 calories through exercise.
   - So, his net calorie intake is 1100 - 200 = 900 calories.

3. **Calculate how many more calories Hiroshi can consume:**
   - His target is 3300 calories, and he has consumed 900 calories.
   - So, the remaining calories he can consume is 3300 - 900 = 2400 calories.

4. **Calculate the calories in one serving of popcorn:**
   - A bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving.
   - Since the bag has 6 servings, the total calories in the bag is 200 * 6 = 1200 calories.

5. **Calculate how many servings of popcorn Hiroshi can consume:**
   - To find out how many servings he can consume with the remaining 2400 calories, we divide:
   - 2400 calories / 200 calories per serving = 12 servings.

6. **Calculate the total grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume:**
   - Each bag of popcorn weighs 300 grams and contains 6 servings.
   - Therefore, each serving weighs 300 grams / 6 servings = 50 grams.
   - So, for 12 servings, the total weight of popcorn is 12 servings * 50 grams/serving = 600 grams.

7. **Calculate Tara's daily calorie target:**
   - Tara weighs 140 lbs.
   - Her target is 140 lbs * 15 calories/lb = 2100 calories.

8. **Calculate Tara's net calorie intake:**
   - Tara has consumed 900 calories in food and 200 calories in ice cream.
   - So, her total consumption is 900 + 200 = 1100 calories.

9. **Calculate how many more calories Tara can consume:**
   - Her target is 2100 calories, and she has consumed 1100 calories.
   - So, the remaining calories she can consume is 2100 - 1100 = 1000 calories.

10. **Calculate how many servings of popcorn Tara can consume:**
    - To find out how many servings she can consume with the remaining 1000 calories, we divide:
    - 1000 calories / 200 calories per serving = 5 servings.

11. **Calculate the total grams of popcorn Tara needs to consume:**
    - For 5 servings, the total weight of popcorn is 5 servings * 50 grams/serving = 250 grams.

12. **Calculate how many more grams of popcorn Hiroshi needs to consume than Tara:**
    - Hiroshi needs to consume 600 grams, and Tara needs to consume 250 grams.
    - So, the difference is 600 grams - 250 grams = 350 grams.

The answer is 350 grams.",350.0,1,0,1,350.0,,,

She already has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges of her large country home. She also purchased 200 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Daphne remain with?",335.0,"To find out how many potted plants Daphne will have remaining, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of potted plants Daphne currently has:**
   - She received 23 new potted plants two days ago.
   - She already has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges.

   First, calculate the total number of potted plants on the window ledges:
   \[
   \text{Total plants on ledges} = 8 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 56 \text{ ledges} = 448 \text{ plants}
   \]

   Now, add the 23 new potted plants:
   \[
   \text{Total plants after receiving new ones} = 448 + 23 = 471 \text{ plants}
   \]

2. **Add the new plants purchased yesterday:**
   - Daphne purchased 200 new plants at a 50% discount. The discount does not affect the total number of plants, so we simply add these to her total.
   \[
   \text{Total plants after purchase} = 471 + 200 = 671 \text{ plants}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of plants she will give away:**
   - Daphne plans to give away 6 potted plants from each of the 56 ledges.
   \[
   \text{Total plants given away} = 6 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 56 \text{ ledges} = 336 \text{ plants}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining number of potted plants:**
   - Subtract the number of plants given away from the total number of plants.
   \[
   \text{Remaining plants} = 671 - 336 = 335 \text{ plants}

Thus, the total number of potted plants Daphne will have remaining is \(\boxed{335}\).",335.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Initial Plants**: Daphne received 23 new potted plants from the nursery.
2. **Existing Plants**: She already has 8 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges.
   - Total existing plants = 8 plants/ledge * 56 ledges = 448 plants.
3. **Total Plants After Receiving New Ones**: 
   - Total plants = Existing plants + New plants = 448 + 23 = 471 plants.
4. **Purchased Plants**: She purchased 200 new plants yesterday.
   - Total plants after purchase = 471 + 200 = 671 plants.
5. **Plants Given Away**: She plans to give away 6 potted plants from each ledge.

However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?",540.0,"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city, we first need to understand the initial conditions and the effect of the wind speed change.

1. **City Size**: The city is 80 miles across.
2. **1/4 of the City**: 1/4 of 80 miles is:
   \[
   \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Fog Coverage Rate**: The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes. Therefore, the rate of coverage is:
   \[
   \text{Rate} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{15 \text{ minutes}}
   \]

4. **Time to Cover 20 Miles**: To find out how long it takes to cover 20 miles at the initial rate, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Time} = 20 \text{ miles} \times 15 \text{ minutes/mile} = 300 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Wind Speed Change**: The problem states that the wind speed will be halved in one hour. This means that after 60 minutes, the fog will cover less distance in the same amount of time.

6. **Coverage in the First Hour**: In the first hour (60 minutes), the fog covers:
   \[
   4 \text{ miles}
   \]

7. **New Rate After One Hour**: After one hour, the rate of coverage will be halved. The new rate will be:
   \[
   \text{New Rate} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{15 \text{ minutes}} \div 2 = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{30 \text{ minutes}}
   \]

8. **Distance Remaining After One Hour**: After the first hour, the fog has covered 4 miles, so the remaining distance to cover is:
   \[
   20 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} = 16 \text{ miles}
   \]

9. **Time to Cover Remaining 16 Miles**: At the new rate of 1 mile per 30 minutes, the time to cover the remaining 16 miles is:
   \[
   \text{Time} = 16 \text{ miles} \times 30 \text{ minutes/mile} = 480 \text{ minutes}
   \]

10. **Total Time**: The total time to cover 20 miles is the time for the first hour plus the time for the remaining distance:
    \[
    \text{Total Time} = 60 \text{ minutes} + 480 \text{ minutes} = 540 \text{ minutes}
    \]

Thus, it will take a total of **540 minutes** for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city.",4.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. The city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge.
2. We need to find out how long it takes for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city.
3. 1/4 of the city is 80 miles / 4 = 20 miles.
4. The fog bank covers 4 miles in 60 minutes.
5. To find out how long it takes to cover 1 mile, we can divide the time by the distance: 
   - 60 minutes / 4 miles = 15 minutes per mile.
6. Now, we need to find out how long it takes to cover 20 miles:
   - 20 miles * 15 minutes per mile = 300 minutes.
7. However, we need to consider that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. This means that after 60 minutes, the fog bank will cover less distance.
8. In the first hour (60 minutes), the fog bank covers 4 miles.
9. After 60 minutes, the wind speed is halved, which means the fog bank will cover only 2 miles in the next hour (60 minutes).
10. So, in the first hour, it covers 4 miles, and in the second hour, it covers 2 miles, totaling 6 miles in 120 minutes.
11. We still need to cover 20 miles, so we have 20 miles - 6 miles = 14 miles left to cover.
12. After the second hour, the fog bank continues to cover 2 miles every hour.
13. To cover the remaining 14 miles at the rate of 2 miles per hour, it will take 14 miles / 2 miles per hour = 7 hours.
14. Since 7 hours is 420 minutes, we add this to the 120 minutes already spent:

On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 2-hour episodes. On Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes. If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?",6.0,"To find out how many 15-minute episodes Santiago watched on Thursday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he spent watching TV from Tuesday to Sunday, excluding Thursday.

1. **Tuesday**: Watched 4 hours.
2. **Wednesday**: Watched 4 hours.
3. **Thursday**: Let \( x \) be the number of 15-minute episodes he watched.
4. **Friday**: Watched 3 hours and 45 minutes. We convert this to hours:

6. **Sunday**: Watched three 15-minute episodes. We convert this to hours:
   \[
   3 \times \frac{15}{60} \text{ hours} = 3 \times 0.25 = 0.75 \text{ hours}

Next, we convert 1.5 hours into minutes:
\[
1.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \times 60 = 90 \text{ minutes}

   - On Friday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. 
     - 45 minutes is 0.75 hours, so total for Friday is 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours.
   - On Saturday, he watched three 2-hour episodes. 
     - Total for Saturday is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

2. **Add the hours from Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday:**
   - Total hours from Tuesday and Wednesday: 4 + 4 = 8 hours.

[Example Input]
Question: Emily reads books every day. On Monday and Tuesday, she read 3-hour books. On Wednesday, she read two 30-minute books. On Thursday, she read a 2-hour book and a 1-hour book. On Friday, she read three 15-minute books. If she read a total of 15 hours this week, how many 15-minute books did she read on Friday?
Wrong answer: I calculated that Emily read 3 hours on Monday and Tuesday, 1 hour on Wednesday, 3 hours on Thursday, and 3 hours on Friday, which totals 10 hours. I mistakenly thought she read 5 hours on Friday instead of 3 hours, leading me to conclude she read 5 books instead of 3.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total hours Emily read throughout the week and incorrectly added the hours for each day, which led to an incorrect total. I also misunderstood the conversion of hours to 15-minute segments.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Addition error
- Misunderstanding of time conversion

Instructions:
1. Break down the problem by identifying the time spent on each day.
2. Convert all time measurements to the same unit (e.g., hours to minutes).
3. Add the total time spent watching TV for each day.
4. Subtract the total time from the overall time to find the time spent on the specific day in question.
5. Convert the time spent on that day back to the number of 15-minute episodes.

Advice:
- Always double-check your calculations for each step.
- Ensure you are consistent with the units of measurement you are using.
- When dealing with totals, keep track of what has been accounted for to avoid double counting or missing segments.

Solution:
Emily read 15 hours in total. She read 6 hours on Monday and Tuesday (3 hours each), 1 hour on Wednesday (two 30-minute books), and 3 hours on Thursday (2-hour and 1-hour books). This totals 10 hours. Therefore, she read 5 hours on Friday, which is equivalent to 20 15-minute books.

   - **Thursday:** Let’s denote the total time watched on Thursday as \( T \) (in hours).
   - **Friday:** 3 hours + 0.75 hours (45 minutes) = 3.75 hours
   - **Saturday:** 3 episodes × 2 hours = 6 hours
   - **Sunday:** 3 episodes × 0.25 hours (15 minutes) = 0.75 hours

2. **Add the known hours:**
   - Total hours from Tuesday and Wednesday: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \) hours
   - Total hours from Friday: \( 3.75 \) hours
   - Total hours from Saturday: \( 6 \) hours
   - Total hours from Sunday: \( 0.75 \) hours

3. **Set up the equation for total hours:**
   \[
   8 + T + 3.75 + 6 + 0.75 = 20
   \]
   \[
   18.5 + T = 20
   \]
   \[
   T = 20 - 18.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Convert Thursday's time to 15-minute episodes:**
   - 1.5 hours = 90 minutes
   - Number of 15-minute episodes on Thursday: 
   \[
   \frac{90 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/episode}} = 6 \text{ episodes}
   \]

### Final Answer:
Santiago watched **6 episodes** of the 15-minute show on Thursday.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Nia makes tea using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 54:27. She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, and uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar. She used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?",60.0,"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the ratios and the total amounts given.

1. **Understanding the Ratios**:
   - The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 54:27. This can be simplified:
     \[
     \frac{54}{27} = 2
     \]
   - This means for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, there are 1 cup of water.

2. **Milk and Cream Ratios**:
   - Nia uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water, which simplifies to 1 tablespoon of milk per cup of water.
   - She uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar.

3. **Setting Up the Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of teaspoons of sugar used.
   - From the sugar to water ratio, the number of cups of water used is:
     \[
     \frac{x}{2}
     \]
   - The number of tablespoons of milk used (since it’s 1 tablespoon per cup of water) is:
     \[
     \frac{x}{2}
     \]
   - The number of tablespoons of heavy cream used (2 tablespoons per teaspoon of sugar) is:
     \[
     2x
     \]

4. **Total Amounts**:
   - The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is given as 240:
     \[
     x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x + \frac{x}{2} = 240
     \]

5. **Combining Like Terms**:
   - Combine the terms:
     \[
     x + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = 240
     \]
     \[
     x + 2x + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 240
     \]
     \[
     x + 2x + x = 240
     \]
     \[
     4x = 240
     \]

6. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - Divide both sides by 4:
     \[
     x = \frac{240}{4} = 60
     \]

Thus, the number of teaspoons of sugar Nia used is \( \boxed{60} \).",60.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Understanding the ratios**: Nia uses sugar and water in a ratio of 54:27. This means for every 54 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 27 cups of water. We can simplify this ratio:
   - 54:27 simplifies to 2:1 (since 54 ÷ 27 = 2 and 27 ÷ 27 = 1).

2. **Finding the total parts in the ratio**: The total parts in the ratio of sugar to water is 2 + 1 = 3 parts.

3. **Finding the total amount used**: Nia used a total of 240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. We need to determine how much of this total corresponds to the sugar and water.

4. **Calculating the amount per part**: Since the total is divided into 3 parts (2 parts for sugar and 1 part for water), we can find the value of each part:
   - Total amount = 240
   - Amount per part = 240 / 3 = 80.

5. **Calculating the amount of sugar**: Since sugar corresponds to 2 parts, we calculate the total amount of sugar:
   - Amount of sugar = 2 parts * 80 = 160 teaspoons.

6. **Conclusion**: Nia used 160 teaspoons of sugar.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I initially answered the question incorrectly by miscalculating the total contributions of each ingredient based on the ratios provided. I failed to properly account for the total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk, leading to an incorrect total.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation of totals
- Incorrect application of ratios
- Failure to account for all components
- Confusion between different units of measurement

### Instructions:
1. Identify the ratio of sugar to water (54:27) and simplify it if necessary.
2. Determine the total parts in the ratio (54 + 27 = 81 parts).
3. Calculate the amount of each ingredient per part based on the total used (240 teaspoons, cups, tablespoons).
4. Find the value of one part by dividing the total amount (240) by the total parts (81).
5. Calculate the amount of sugar using the ratio (54 parts) multiplied by the value of one part.
6. Verify that the total of all ingredients matches the expected total based on the ratios and the given total.

### Solution:
1. The ratio of sugar to water is 54:27, which simplifies to 2:1.
2. The total parts in the ratio are 54 + 27 = 81 parts.
3. The total amount used is 240 (teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk).
4. The value of one part is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Value of one part} = \frac{240}{81} \approx 2.96 \text{ (rounded to two decimal places)}
   \]
5. The amount of sugar (54 parts) is:
   \[
   \text{Amount of sugar} = 54 \times 2.96 \approx 160.64 \text{ teaspoons}
   \]
   Since we are looking for whole teaspoons, we round this to 161 teaspoons.
6. To verify, we calculate the amount of water (27 parts):
   \[
   \text{Amount of water} = 27 \times 2.96 \approx 80.00 \text{ cups}
   \]
   The amount of cream (2 tablespoons per teaspoon of sugar):
   \[
   \text{Amount of cream} = 2 \times 240 = 480 \text{ tablespoons}
   \]
   The amount of milk (8 tablespoons for every 8 cups of water):
   \[
   \text{Amount of milk} = 8 \text{ tablespoons}
   \]
   Adding these gives:
   \[
   161 + 80 + 480 + 8 = 729 \text{ (which does not match 240)}
   \]
   This indicates a miscalculation in the total contributions. 

### Final Calculation:
To find the correct amount of sugar, we need to consider the total contributions of all ingredients correctly. 

1. The total parts from the ratios are 81.
2. The total amount of sugar and water combined is 240 - (amount of cream + amount of milk).
3. Since the cream and milk are based on the sugar and water, we need to recalculate based on the ratios.

After recalculating, we find:
- Sugar: 54 parts
- Water: 27 parts
- Cream: 2 tablespoons per teaspoon of sugar
- Milk: 8 tablespoons for every 8 cups of water

Thus, the correct amount of sugar used is:
\[
\text{Sugar} = \frac{54}{81} \times 240 = 160 \text{ teaspoons}
\]

### General Advice:
- Always ensure to account for all components in a ratio problem.
- Double-check the calculations for each ingredient based on the ratios.
- Simplify ratios when possible to make calculations easier.
- Keep track of units and ensure they are consistent throughout the problem.","--- Beginning of the template ---

I answered the question incorrectly because I miscalculated the total contributions of each ingredient based on the ratios provided. I failed to properly account for the total of 240 teaspoons, cups, and tablespoons, and how they relate to the ratios of sugar, water, milk, and cream. Instead of breaking down the total into the respective parts according to the ratios, I mistakenly assumed a direct relationship without verifying the contributions of each ingredient.

### Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of total
- Incorrect application of ratios
- Proportional reasoning error

### Solution:
1. **Identify the ratios**: The ratio of sugar to water is 54:27. This can be simplified to 2:1 (since 54/27 = 2).
2. **Determine the total parts in the ratio**: For sugar and water, there are 2 parts (sugar) + 1 part (water) = 3 parts.
3. **Calculate the value of one part**: Let’s denote the total amount of sugar and water as \( S + W \). We also need to account for milk and cream.
4. **Identify contributions of milk and cream**: 
   - For every 8 cups of water, there are 8 tablespoons of milk. This means the ratio of milk to water is 1:1.
   - For every teaspoon of sugar, there are 2 tablespoons of cream. This means the ratio of cream to sugar is 2:1.
5. **Set up the equation**: Let \( x \) be the number of teaspoons of sugar. Then:
   - Water = \( \frac{x}{2} \) (from the sugar to water ratio)
   - Milk = \( \frac{x}{2} \) (since milk is equal to water)
   - Cream = \( 2x \) (from the sugar to cream ratio)
6. **Total equation**: The total is given as 240:
   \[
   x + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = 240
   \]
   Simplifying this:
   \[
   x + x + 2x = 240 \implies 4x = 240 \implies x = 60
   \]
7. **Conclusion**: Nia used **60 teaspoons of sugar**.

### Instructions:
1. Identify the ratios of the ingredients involved.
2. Simplify the ratios to their lowest terms if possible.
3. Determine the total parts represented by the ratios.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Aisha was preparing for a lunch party at her house, where she intended to serve stuffed peppers. She noticed that she was out of plastic forks, so she bought a new package of forks. Later, her husband also bought a package of 8 new forks and gave them to Aisha. While Aisha was making the stuffed peppers, she used sixteen of the forks to sample her stuffed peppers, then threw away 6 defective forks. The guests also brought 2 packs of forks, each having 6 inside them. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 32 forks. How many forks were in the package that Aisha bought?",34.0,"Let's denote the number of forks in the package that Aisha bought as \( x \).

1. Aisha bought \( x \) forks.
2. Her husband bought 8 forks.
3. Aisha used 16 forks to sample the stuffed peppers.
4. Aisha threw away 6 defective forks.
5. The guests brought 2 packs of forks, each containing 6 forks, which totals \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) forks.

Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of forks Aisha had after all these transactions:

\[
\text{Total forks} = \text{Aisha's forks} + \text{Husband's forks} + \text{Guests' forks} - \text{Used forks} - \text{Defective forks}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
32 = x + 8 + 12 - 16 - 6
\]

Now, simplify the right side:

\[
32 = x + 8 + 12 - 16 - 6
\]
\[
32 = x + 20 - 22
\]
\[
32 = x - 2
\]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 32 + 2

\[
x = 34

Thus, the number of forks in the package that Aisha bought is \( \boxed{34} \).",34.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of forks in the package that Aisha bought.
2. Aisha's husband bought 8 new forks, so now she has \( x + 8 \) forks.
3. Aisha used 16 forks to sample her stuffed peppers, so the number of forks left is \( x + 8 - 16 = x - 8 \).
4. Aisha threw away 6 defective forks, so now she has \( x - 8 - 6 = x - 14 \) forks.
5. The guests brought 2 packs of forks, each containing 6 forks, which totals \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) forks.
6. Adding the forks from the guests, the total number of forks Aisha has is \( (x - 14) + 12 = x - 2 \).
7. We know that this total equals 32 forks, so we set up the equation: 
   \[
   x - 2 = 32

8. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 32 + 2 = 34

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field. There are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard. Ravi can harvest his bananas every 4 months. In addition, Ravi owns a 13-square yard apricot field that produces 12 apricots per square yard. The apricots can be harvested every 4 months. In the span of two years, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?",1764.0,"To find out how many more bananas Ravi harvests than apricots in two years, we will first calculate the total harvest of bananas and apricots separately, and then compare the two.

### Step 1: Calculate the total bananas harvested

1. **Banana field area**: 10 square yards
2. **Bananas per four-fifths of a square yard**: 36 bananas

First, we need to find out how many bananas are produced per square yard:

\[
\text{Bananas per square yard} = \frac{36 \text{ bananas}}{\frac{4}{5} \text{ square yards}} = 36 \times \frac{5}{4} = 45 \text{ bananas per square yard}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total number of bananas harvested from the 10 square yards:

\[
\text{Total bananas} = 10 \text{ square yards} \times 45 \text{ bananas per square yard} = 450 \text{ bananas}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many times Ravi can harvest in two years. Since he harvests every 4 months, in two years (which is 24 months), he can harvest:

\[
\text{Number of harvests} = \frac{24 \text{ months}}{4 \text{ months per harvest}} = 6 \text{ harvests}
\]

Thus, the total number of bananas harvested in two years is:

\[
\text{Total bananas in 2 years} = 450 \text{ bananas} \times 6 = 2700 \text{ bananas}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total apricots harvested

1. **Apricot field area**: 13 square yards
2. **Apricots per square yard**: 12 apricots

Now, we calculate the total number of apricots harvested from the 13 square yards:

\[
\text{Total apricots} = 13 \text{ square yards} \times 12 \text{ apricots per square yard} = 156 \text{ apricots}
\]

Using the same number of harvests (6) as for the bananas, the total number of apricots harvested in two years is:

\[
\text{Total apricots in 2 years} = 156 \text{ apricots} \times 6 = 936 \text{ apricots}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference between bananas and apricots

Now we can find out how many more bananas Ravi harvests than apricots:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total bananas} - \text{Total apricots} = 2700 \text{ bananas} - 936 \text{ apricots} = 1764
\]

### Conclusion

Ravi harvests **1764 more bananas** than apricots in the span of two years.",1764.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total area of the banana field:**
   Ravi has 10 square yards of banana field.

2. **Determine the number of bananas per square yard:**
   There are 36 bananas per four-fifths of a square yard. To find the number of bananas per square yard, we can set up a proportion:
   \[
   \text{Bananas per square yard} = \frac{36 \text{ bananas}}{\frac{4}{5} \text{ square yards}} = 36 \times \frac{5}{4} = 45 \text{ bananas per square yard}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of bananas Ravi can harvest:**
   Total bananas = Area of banana field × Bananas per square yard
   \[
   \text{Total bananas} = 10 \text{ square yards} \times 45 \text{ bananas/square yard} = 450 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. **Determine the harvest frequency for bananas:**
   Ravi can harvest his bananas every 4 months. In 2 years, there are:
   \[
   2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months}
   \]
   The number of harvests in 2 years is:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ months}}{4 \text{ months/harvest}} = 6 \text{ harvests}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of bananas harvested in 2 years:**
   \[
   \text{Total bananas harvested} = 450 \text{ bananas/harvest} \times 6 \text{ harvests} = 2700 \text{ bananas}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total area of the apricot field:**
   Ravi has a 13-square yard apricot field.

7. **Determine the number of apricots per square yard:**
   The apricot field produces 12 apricots per square yard.

8. **Calculate the total number of apricots Ravi can harvest:**
   Total apricots = Area of apricot field × Apricots per square yard
   \[
   \text{Total apricots} = 13 \text{ square yards} \times 12 \text{ apricots/square yard} = 156 \text{ apricots}
   \]

9. **Determine the harvest frequency for apricots:**
   Ravi can harvest his apricots every 4 months, just like the bananas. Thus, he also has 6 harvests in 2 years.

10. **Calculate the total number of apricots harvested in 2 years:**
    \[
    \text{Total apricots harvested} = 156 \text{ apricots/harvest} \times 6 \text{ harvests} = 936 \text{ apricots}
    \]

11. **Calculate how many more bananas Ravi harvests than apricots:**
    \[
    \text{Difference} = \text{Total bananas harvested} - \text{Total apricots harvested}
    \]
    \[
    \text{Difference} = 2700 \text{ bananas} - 936 \text{ apricots} = 1764

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Arjun went to buy some school supplies. He bought 12 folders which cost $4.75 each, 8 erasers which cost $14.5 each, and a ream of bond paper which cost $11. He also bought 7 pencils which cost $8 each. Arjun can either pay a one-time $20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases, or not become a member and receive only a 5% discount. What is the least amount Arjun can spend on everything?",212.0,"To determine the least amount Arjun can spend, we will first calculate the total cost of his purchases without any discounts, then apply the discounts for both membership options, and finally compare the total costs.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost without discounts

1. **Cost of folders**:
   \[
   12 \text{ folders} \times 4.75 \text{ dollars/folder} = 57.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of erasers**:
   \[
   8 \text{ erasers} \times 14.50 \text{ dollars/eraser} = 116.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of bond paper**:
   \[
   1 \text{ ream} \times 11.00 \text{ dollars/ream} = 11.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of pencils**:
   \[
   7 \text{ pencils} \times 8.00 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 56.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum these costs:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 57.00 + 116.00 + 11.00 + 56.00 = 240.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost with discounts

#### Option 1: Become a member (20% discount)

1. **Calculate the discount**:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 20\% \text{ of } 240.00 = 0.20 \times 240.00 = 48.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Total cost after discount**:
   \[
   \text{Cost after discount} = 240.00 - 48.00 = 192.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Add the membership fee**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost with membership} = 192.00 + 20.00 = 212.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

#### Option 2: Do not become a member (5% discount)

1. **Calculate the discount**:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 5\% \text{ of } 240.00 = 0.05 \times 240.00 = 12.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Total cost after discount**:
   \[
   \text{Cost after discount} = 240.00 - 12.00 = 228.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 3: Compare the total costs

- Total cost with membership: **$212.00**
- Total cost without membership: **$228.00**

### Conclusion

The least amount Arjun can spend is:
\[
\boxed{212.00} \text{ dollars}
\]",212.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost without any discounts:**
   - Cost of folders: 12 folders * $4.75 each = 12 * 4.75 = $57.00
   - Cost of erasers: 8 erasers * $14.50 each = 8 * 14.50 = $116.00
   - Cost of bond paper: 1 ream * $11.00 = $11.00
   - Cost of pencils: 7 pencils * $8.00 each = 7 * 8 = $56.00

   Now, let's add these costs together:
   - Total cost = $57.00 + $116.00 + $11.00 + $56.00 = $240.00

2. **Calculate the total cost with the 20% discount (if he becomes a member):**
   - Total cost after 20% discount = Total cost * (1 - 0.20)
   - Total cost after 20% discount = $240.00 * 0.80 = $192.00
   - Adding the membership fee: $192.00 + $20.00 = $212.00

3. **Calculate the total cost with the 5% discount (if he does not become a member):**
   - Total cost after 5% discount = Total cost * (1 - 0.05)
   - Total cost after 5% discount = $240.00 * 0.95 = $228.00

4. **Compare the two total costs:**
   - Total cost with membership (including fee) = $212.00
   - Total cost without membership = $228.00

5. **Determine the least amount Arjun can spend:**
   - The least amount Arjun can spend is $212.00 (by becoming a member).

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Yusuf is rolling a twenty-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he rolls a number greater than 5 twice in a row, than that he rolls four even numbers in a row?",50.0,"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events: rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row and rolling four even numbers in a row with a twenty-sided die.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5.

A twenty-sided die has the numbers 1 through 20. The numbers greater than 5 are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. 

Counting these, we find:
- Numbers greater than 5: 15 (from 6 to 20)

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is:
\[
P(\text{greater than 5}) = \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is:
\[
P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) = P(\text{greater than 5}) \times P(\text{greater than 5}) = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) \times \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \frac{9}{16}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the probability of rolling an even number.

The even numbers on a twenty-sided die are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20. 

Counting these, we find:
- Even numbers: 10 (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20)

The probability of rolling an even number is:
\[
P(\text{even}) = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling an even number four times in a row is:
\[
P(\text{even four times}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16}
\]

### Step 5: Compare the two probabilities.

Now we have:
- Probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice: \(\frac{9}{16}\)
- Probability of rolling four even numbers: \(\frac{1}{16}\)

### Step 6: Calculate the difference in percentage points.

First, we convert these probabilities to percentages:
- Probability of rolling greater than 5 twice:
\[
\frac{9}{16} \times 100 = 56.25\%
\]
- Probability of rolling four even numbers:
\[
\frac{1}{16} \times 100 = 6.25\%
\]

Now, we find the difference:
\[
\text{Difference} = 56.25\% - 6.25\% = 50\%
\]

### Final Answer

Yusuf is **50 percentage points** more likely to roll a number greater than 5 twice in a row than to roll four even numbers in a row.",5.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a twenty-sided die.**
   - The numbers greater than 5 on a twenty-sided die are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
   - There are 15 numbers greater than 5.
   - The total number of outcomes on a twenty-sided die is 20.
   - So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is:
     \[
     P(\text{greater than 5}) = \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row.**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is:
     \[
     P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) = P(\text{greater than 5}) \times P(\text{greater than 5}) = 0.75 \times 0.75 = 0.5625
     \]

3. **Determine the probability of rolling an even number on a twenty-sided die.**
   - The even numbers on a twenty-sided die are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20.
   - There are 10 even numbers.
   - So, the probability of rolling an even number is:
     \[
     P(\text{even}) = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]

4. **Calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row.**
   - The probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is:
     \[
     P(\text{four evens}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.5^4 = 0.0625
     \]

5. **Calculate the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row and rolling four even numbers in a row.**
   - The difference is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = P(\text{greater than 5 twice}) - P(\text{four evens}) = 0.5625 - 0.0625 = 0.5
     \]

6. **Convert the difference to percentage points.**
   - To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     \text{Difference in percentage points} = 0.5 \times 100 = 50
     \]

3. Identify the number of white animals: 26 white animals, half of which are rabbits means there are \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) rabbits.
4. Identify the number of wasps: 24 wasps.
5. Calculate the total number of animals in the plot:
   - Total = Bees + Beetles + Rabbits + Wasps
   - Total = 9 (bees) + 6 (beetles) + 13 (rabbits) + 24 (wasps) = 52 animals.
6. Calculate the percentage of animals that are rabbits:
   - Percentage of rabbits = \( \left( \frac{\text{Number of rabbits}}{\text{Total number of animals}} \right) \times 100 \)
   - Percentage of rabbits = \( \left( \frac{13}{52} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \).

### Advice:
- Carefully account for all types of animals mentioned in the problem.
- Ensure that all calculations are based on the correct total number of animals.
- Double-check the relationships and calculations to avoid miscounting.

### Solution:
25% of the animals in the plot were rabbits.","--- Beginning of the template ---

Question: A farmer has a total of 60 animals, which are either cows or sheep. If the number of cows is 3 times the number of sheep, how many cows are there?
Wrong answer: I calculated that there are 15 cows because I thought the number of cows was half of the total animals instead of three times the number of sheep.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the relationship between the number of cows and sheep. I should have set up the equation based on the ratio given (cows = 3 * sheep) instead of assuming a different relationship.

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Incorrect ratio
- Algebraic setup error

Instructions:
1. Define variables for the unknowns (let sheep = x, then cows = 3x).
2. Set up the equation based on the total number of animals (x + 3x = 60).
3. Solve for x to find the number of sheep.
4. Use the value of x to find the number of cows (3x).
5. Double-check the calculations to ensure they align with the problem's conditions.

Advice:
- Always clarify the relationships between quantities before setting up equations.
- Write down the equations clearly to avoid confusion.
- Check your work by substituting back into the original problem to verify the solution.

Solution:
Let sheep = x. Then cows = 3x. The equation is x + 3x = 60, which simplifies to 4x = 60. Solving for x gives x = 15 (sheep), so cows = 3 * 15 = 45. Therefore, there are 45 cows.

I answered the question incorrectly because I miscalculated the total number of animals in the plot and did not properly account for the number of rabbits. I mistakenly assumed the percentage of rabbits based on an incorrect total count of animals.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect total count
- Percentage calculation error

### Solution:
1. **Identify the number of each type of animal:**
   - **Bees:** 9
   - **Wasps:** 24
   - **White animals:** 26 (half of which are rabbits, so there are 13 rabbits)
   - **Beetles:** The number of beetles is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the number of bees. Therefore, the number of beetles is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \).

2. **Calculate the total number of animals:**
   - Total animals = Bees + Wasps + Rabbits + Beetles
   - Total animals = 9 (bees) + 24 (wasps) + 13 (rabbits) + 6 (beetles) = 52

3. **Calculate the percentage of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is 13.
   - The percentage of rabbits = \( \left( \frac{\text{Number of rabbits}}{\text{Total number of animals}} \right) \times 100 \)

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?",11000.0,"To determine how much more the total cost will be than Mrs. Lee's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the townhouse after applying the discount and adding the brokerage and transfer fees.

1. **Calculate the discount on the selling price:**
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = 400,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 25\% \text{ of Selling Price} = 0.25 \times 400,000 = 100,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Discount} = 400,000 - 100,000 = 300,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee (5% of the selling price):**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 5\% \text{ of Selling Price} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the transfer fee (12% of the selling price):**
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 12\% \text{ of Selling Price} = 0.12 \times 400,000 = 48,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Discounted Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 300,000 + 20,000 + 48,000 = 368,000
   \]

5. **Determine how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Lee's budget:**
   \[
   \text{Budget} = 340,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount Over Budget} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Budget} = 368,000 - 340,000 = 28,000
   \]

Thus, the total cost will be **$28,000** more than Mrs. Lee's budget.",28000.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Selling Price of the Property**: The selling price is $400,000.

2. **Discount Calculation**: Mrs. Lee can get a 25% discount on the selling price.
   - Discount amount = 25% of $400,000 = 0.25 * $400,000 = $100,000.
   - Selling price after discount = $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000.

3. **Brokerage Fee Calculation**: The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   - Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

4. **Transfer Fee Calculation**: The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.
   - Transfer fee = 12% of $400,000 = 0.12 * $400,000 = $48,000.

5. **Total Cost Calculation**: Now, we add the selling price after discount, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to find the total cost.
   - Total cost = Selling price after discount + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
   - Total cost = $300,000 + $20,000 + $48,000 = $368,000.

6. **Budget Comparison**: Mrs. Lee's budget is $340,000.
   - Difference = Total cost - Budget = $368,000 - $340,000 = $28,000.

Question: A couple is looking to buy a car that costs $25,000. They have a budget of $20,000. The dealership offers a 10% discount on the car price, but there is also a 7% sales tax applied to the final price after the discount. How much more will the total cost be than their budget?

Wrong answer: I calculated the discount as $2,500, so the price after the discount is $22,500. Then I added 7% sales tax, which is $1,575, making the total cost $24,075. I concluded that the cost exceeds their budget by $4,075.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the sales tax by applying it to the original price instead of the discounted price. I also failed to correctly subtract the budget from the total cost to find the excess amount.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect application of tax
- Budget comparison error

Instructions:
1. Calculate the discount on the original price.
2. Subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price.
3. Calculate the sales tax based on the discounted price.
4. Add the sales tax to the discounted price to find the total cost.
5. Compare the total cost to the budget to determine how much it exceeds.

Advice:
- Always ensure you apply percentages to the correct base amount.
- Double-check your calculations at each step.
- Clearly outline your steps to avoid confusion when comparing totals.

Solution:
1. Discount: 10% of $25,000 = $2,500.
2. Discounted price: $25,000 - $2,500 = $22,500.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Mrs. Lee is looking for a new townhouse that will not go beyond her $340000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $400000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 28000.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I miscalculated the total cost by not properly accounting for the discount before applying the brokerage and transfer fees. I also failed to correctly sum all the costs associated with the purchase, leading to an incorrect total cost and comparison with Mrs. Lee's budget.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect order of operations
- Incomplete cost assessment

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the discount on the selling price:**
   - Selling price: $400,000
   - Discount: 25% of $400,000 = 0.25 * $400,000 = $100,000
   - Discounted price: $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   - Brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

3. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   - Transfer fee: 12% of $400,000 = 0.12 * $400,000 = $48,000

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Discounted price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
   - Total cost = $300,000 + $20,000 + $48,000 = $368,000

5. **Compare the total cost to Mrs. Lee's budget:**
   - Budget: $340,000
   - Amount exceeding budget = Total cost - Budget
   - Amount exceeding budget = $368,000 - $340,000 = $28,000

### Final Answer:
The total cost exceeds Mrs. Lee's budget by **$28,000**.

### Instructions for Future Problems:
1. Identify the original selling price and any applicable discounts.
2. Calculate the discount and determine the discounted price.
3. Identify any additional fees (brokerage, transfer, etc.) and calculate them based on the original selling price.
4. Sum the discounted price and all additional fees to find the total cost.
5. Compare the total cost to the budget to determine how much it exceeds.

### General Advice for Similar Problems:
- Always calculate discounts before applying additional fees.
- Ensure you understand which base amount to use for percentage calculations.
- Keep track of all components of the total cost to avoid missing any fees.
- Double-check your calculations and ensure that you are comparing the correct totals.","--- Beginning of the template ---

Question: A couple is looking to buy a car that costs $25,000. They have a budget of $20,000. The dealership offers a 10% discount on the car price, but there is also a 7% sales tax applied to the final price after the discount. How much more will the total cost be than their budget?

Wrong answer: I calculated the discount as $2,500, so the price after the discount is $22,500. Then I added 7% sales tax, which is $1,575, making the total cost $24,075. I concluded that the cost exceeds their budget by $4,075.

[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the sales tax by applying it to the original price instead of the discounted price. I also failed to correctly subtract the budget from the total cost to find the excess amount.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect application of tax
- Budget comparison error

Instructions:
1. Calculate the discount on the original price.
2. Subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price.
3. Calculate the sales tax based on the discounted price.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Dr. Brown sold his villa for $550000. He paid the legal fees that amounted to 2% of the selling price and also paid a realtor fee that is 5% of the selling price. He also paid $440000 for the remaining loan amount on the villa, and $5000 for closing costs. Dr. Brown used the net proceeds from selling the villa to invest in stocks. The stocks gained 10% each year for two years. How much were Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years?",80465.0,"To find Dr. Brown's net proceeds after selling his villa and investing in stocks, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the legal fees.**
   \[
   \text{Legal Fees} = 2\% \text{ of } 550,000 = 0.02 \times 550,000 = 11,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the realtor fee.**
   \[
   \text{Realtor Fee} = 5\% \text{ of } 550,000 = 0.05 \times 550,000 = 27,500
   \]

3. **Calculate the total selling costs.**
   \[
   \text{Total Selling Costs} = \text{Legal Fees} + \text{Realtor Fee} + \text{Closing Costs}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Selling Costs} = 11,000 + 27,500 + 5,000 = 43,500
   \]

4. **Calculate the net proceeds from the sale.**
   \[
   \text{Net Proceeds} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Total Selling Costs} - \text{Remaining Loan Amount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Net Proceeds} = 550,000 - 43,500 - 440,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Net Proceeds} = 550,000 - 483,500 = 66,500
   \]

5. **Invest the net proceeds in stocks and calculate the value after two years with a 10% annual gain.**
   - After the first year:
   \[
   \text{Value after Year 1} = \text{Net Proceeds} \times (1 + 0.10) = 66,500 \times 1.10 = 73,150
   \]
   - After the second year:
   \[

Thus, Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years of investing in stocks is \(\boxed{80465}\).",80465.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the legal fees:**
   - The selling price of the villa is $550,000.
   - The legal fees are 2% of the selling price.
   - Legal fees = 2% of $550,000 = 0.02 * 550,000 = $11,000.

2. **Calculate the realtor fee:**
   - The realtor fee is 5% of the selling price.
   - Realtor fee = 5% of $550,000 = 0.05 * 550,000 = $27,500.

3. **Calculate the total fees paid:**
   - Total fees = Legal fees + Realtor fee = $11,000 + $27,500 = $38,500.

4. **Calculate the net proceeds from the sale:**
   - Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees - Remaining loan amount - Closing costs.
   - Remaining loan amount = $440,000.
   - Closing costs = $5,000.
   - Net proceeds = $550,000 - $38,500 - $440,000 - $5,000 = $66,500.

5. **Calculate the investment growth over two years:**
   - The stocks gain 10% each year.
   - After the first year, the value of the investment = Net proceeds + 10% of Net proceeds.
   - Value after 1 year = $66,500 + 0.10 * $66,500 = $66,500 + $6,650 = $73,150.
   - After the second year, the value of the investment = Value after 1 year + 10% of Value after 1 year.
   - Value after 2 years = $73,150 + 0.10 * $73,150 = $73,150 + $7,315 = $80,465.

An eighth of the tennis balls are indigo, and all except an eighth of those indigo balls are marked. How many marked balls are there in total?",16.0,"To find the total number of marked balls, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of balls**: The juggler can juggle 160 balls.

2. **Golf balls**: 
   - \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the balls are golf balls.
   - Number of golf balls = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 160 = 32 \).

3. **Tennis balls**: 
   - The rest of the balls are tennis balls.
   - Number of tennis balls = Total balls - Golf balls = \( 160 - 32 = 128 \).

4. **Yellow golf balls**: 
   - \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the golf balls are yellow.
   - Number of yellow golf balls = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 32 = 16 \).

5. **Marked yellow golf balls**: 
   - \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the yellow golf balls are marked.
   - Number of marked yellow golf balls = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 16 = 2 \).

6. **Indigo tennis balls**: 
   - \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the tennis balls are indigo.
   - Number of indigo tennis balls = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 128 = 16 \).

7. **Marked indigo tennis balls**: 
   - All except \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the indigo balls are marked.
   - Number of unmarked indigo tennis balls = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 16 = 2 \).
   - Therefore, the number of marked indigo tennis balls = Total indigo tennis balls - Unmarked indigo tennis balls = \( 16 - 2 = 14 \).

8. **Total marked balls**: 
   - Total marked balls = Marked yellow golf balls + Marked indigo tennis balls = \( 2 + 14 = 16 \).

Thus, the total number of marked balls is \( \boxed{16} \).",16.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. The juggler can juggle a total of 160 balls.
2. We need to find out how many of these are golf balls. According to the problem, 1/5 of the balls are golf balls:
   \[
   \text{Number of golf balls} = \frac{1}{5} \times 160 = 32
   \]
3. The rest of the balls are tennis balls. To find the number of tennis balls, we subtract the number of golf balls from the total:
   \[
   \text{Number of tennis balls} = 160 - 32 = 128
   \]

4. Next, we find out how many of the golf balls are yellow. It states that 1/2 of the golf balls are yellow:
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow golf balls} = \frac{1}{2} \times 32 = 16
   \]

5. Out of the yellow golf balls, 1/8 are marked:
   \[
   \text{Number of marked yellow golf balls} = \frac{1}{8} \times 16 = 2

6. Now, we need to find out how many of the tennis balls are indigo. It states that 1/8 of the tennis balls are indigo:
   \[
   \text{Number of indigo tennis balls} = \frac{1}{8} \times 128 = 16

7. The problem states that all except 1/8 of the indigo balls are marked. First, we find out how many are not marked:
   \[
   \text{Number of unmarked indigo balls} = \frac{1}{8} \times 16 = 2
   \]
   Therefore, the number of marked indigo balls is:
   \[
   \text{Number of marked indigo balls} = 16 - 2 = 14

If there are one-fourth the number of boys in the park, what percentage of the kids in the park are girls?",80.0,"To find the percentage of kids in the park that are girls, we first need to determine the number of boys in the park.

We know that there are 16 girls, and the number of boys is one-fourth the number of girls. Therefore, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Number of girls} = \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4

Later, Uma saw another 10-foot shark with 6 remoras, each 8 inches long, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?",45.0,"To find the average percentage of each shark's body length that is covered by the remoras, we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert the lengths of the remoras from inches to feet.**
2. **Calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each shark.**
3. **Determine how many remoras are left after some swim away.**
4. **Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that is covered by the remoras.**
5. **Find the average percentage for both sharks.**

### Step 1: Convert the lengths of the remoras to feet

- For the first shark, each remora is 16 inches long. 
  \[
  \text{Length in feet} = \frac{16 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 1.33 \text{ feet}
  \]

- For the second shark, each remora is 8 inches long.
  \[
  \text{Length in feet} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 0.67 \text{ feet}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each shark

- For the first shark (40-foot shark with 18 remoras):
  \[
  \text{Total length of remoras} = 18 \times \frac{4}{3} = 24 \text{ feet}
  \]

- For the second shark (10-foot shark with 6 remoras):
  \[
  \text{Total length of remoras} = 6 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \text{ feet}
  \]

### Step 3: Determine how many remoras are left after some swim away

- For the first shark, \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the remoras swam away:
  \[
  \text{Remoras that swam away} = \frac{1}{6} \times 18 = 3 \text{ remoras}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Remaining remoras} = 18 - 3 = 15 \text{ remoras}
  \]

- The total length of the remaining remoras for the first shark:
  \[
  \text{Total length of remaining remoras} = 15 \times \frac{4}{3} = 20 \text{ feet}
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras

- For the first shark:
  \[
  \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{40 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 50\%

- For the second shark:
  \[
  \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{4 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 40\%

### Step 5: Find the average percentage for both sharks

\[
\text{Average percentage} = \frac{50\% + 40\%}{2} = \frac{90\%}{2} = 45\%
\]

Thus, the average percentage of each shark's body length that is covered by the remoras is **45%**.",45.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the first shark:**
   - There are 18 remoras, each 16 inches long.
   - Total length of remoras = 18 * 16 = 288 inches.

2. **Convert the shark's length from feet to inches:**
   - The first shark is 40 feet long.
   - 1 foot = 12 inches, so 40 feet = 40 * 12 = 480 inches.

3. **Calculate the percentage of the first shark's body length covered by the remoras:**
   - Percentage = (Total length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100
   - Percentage for the first shark = (288 / 480) * 100 = 60%.

4. **Calculate how many remoras swam away:**
   - 1/6 of the 18 remoras swam away.
   - Number of remoras that swam away = 18 / 6 = 3.
   - Remaining remoras = 18 - 3 = 15.

5. **Calculate the total length of the remaining remoras:**
   - Remaining remoras = 15, each 16 inches long.
   - Total length of remaining remoras = 15 * 16 = 240 inches.

6. **Calculate the percentage of the first shark's body length covered by the remaining remoras:**
   - Percentage for the remaining remoras = (240 / 480) * 100 = 50%.

7. **Now, calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the second shark:**
   - There are 6 remoras, each 8 inches long.
   - Total length of remoras = 6 * 8 = 48 inches.

8. **Convert the second shark's length from feet to inches:**
   - The second shark is 10 feet long.
   - 10 feet = 10 * 12 = 120 inches.

9. **Calculate the percentage of the second shark's body length covered by the remoras:**
   - Percentage for the second shark = (48 / 120) * 100 = 40%.

10. **Calculate the average percentage of both sharks' body lengths covered by the remoras:**
    - Average percentage = (Percentage for the first shark + Percentage for the second shark) / 2
    - Average percentage = (60 + 40) / 2 = 50%.

Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 50.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the average percentage of the sharks' body lengths covered by the remoras. I failed to account for the correct number of remoras remaining after a fraction swam away and did not properly calculate the total lengths of the remoras for each shark. Additionally, I did not average the percentages correctly.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Fraction error
- Percentage error
- Averaging error

### Solution:
1. **Convert the body lengths of the sharks from feet to inches:**
   - For the 40-foot shark: 
     \[
     40 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 480 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - For the 10-foot shark: 
     \[
     10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total length of the remoras for the first shark:**
   - There are 18 remoras, each 16 inches long:
     \[
     18 \text{ remoras} \times 16 \text{ inches/remora} = 288 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Determine how many remoras remain after 1/6 swim away:**
   - 1/6 of 18 remoras is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{6} \times 18 = 3 \text{ remoras}
     \]
   - Remaining remoras:
     \[
     18 - 3 = 15 \text{ remoras}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total length of the remaining remoras for the first shark:**
   - Length of remaining remoras:

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Carlos places almonds on bowls and tables. Each bowl can hold 24 almonds while each table can hold three times that. Carlos has 720 almonds, 7 bowls and 3 tables. Unfortunately, 2 tables break. Carlos then eats one-fifth of all the almonds. How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?",14.0,"To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the capacity of the bowls and tables.**
   - Each bowl can hold 24 almonds.
   - Each table can hold three times the capacity of a bowl:
     \[
     \text{Capacity of each table} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ almonds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and tables before any tables break.**
   - Carlos has 7 bowls:
     \[
     \text{Total capacity of bowls} = 7 \times 24 = 168 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - Carlos has 3 tables:
     \[
     \text{Total capacity of tables} = 3 \times 72 = 216 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total capacity of all bowls and tables combined is:
     \[
     \text{Total capacity} = 168 + 216 = 384 \text{ almonds}
     \]

3. **Account for the broken tables.**
   - After 2 tables break, Carlos has:
     \[
     \text{Remaining tables} = 3 - 2 = 1 \text{ table}
     \]
   - The capacity of the remaining table is:
     \[
     \text{Capacity of remaining table} = 1 \times 72 = 72 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - Now, the total capacity with the remaining bowls and tables is:
     \[
     \text{Total capacity with 1 table} = 168 + 72 = 240 \text{ almonds}
     \]

4. **Calculate how many almonds Carlos has after eating some.**
   - Carlos starts with 720 almonds and eats one-fifth of them:
     \[
     \text{Almonds eaten} = \frac{1}{5} \times 720 = 144 \text{ almonds}
     \]
   - The remaining almonds are:
     \[
     \text{Remaining almonds} = 720 - 144 = 576 \text{ almonds}
     \]

5. **Determine how many more bowls are needed to hold the remaining almonds.**
   - Carlos can currently hold 240 almonds with the remaining bowls and tables.
   - To find out how many more bowls are needed, we first calculate how many bowls are required to hold 576 almonds:
     \[
     \text{Bowls needed} = \frac{576}{24} = 24 \text{ bowls}
     \]
   - Carlos already has 7 bowls, so the additional bowls needed are:
     \[
     \text{Additional bowls needed} = 24 - 7 = 17 \text{ bowls}
     \]

Thus, Carlos needs **17 more bowls** to place all the remaining almonds.",17.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the capacity of the tables**: 
   Each bowl can hold 24 almonds. 
   Each table can hold three times that, so:
   \[
   \text{Capacity of each table} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ almonds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total capacity of the bowls and tables**:
   Carlos has 7 bowls and 3 tables, but 2 tables break, leaving him with:
   \[
   \text{Remaining tables} = 3 - 2 = 1 \text{ table}
   \]
   Now, we calculate the total capacity:
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of bowls} = 7 \times 24 = 168 \text{ almonds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of remaining table} = 1 \times 72 = 72 \text{ almonds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = 168 + 72 = 240 \text{ almonds}
   \]

3. **Determine how many almonds Carlos has left after eating**:
   Carlos starts with 720 almonds. He eats one-fifth of them:
   \[
   \text{Almonds eaten} = \frac{1}{5} \times 720 = 144 \text{ almonds}
   \]
   So, the remaining almonds are:
   \[
   \text{Remaining almonds} = 720 - 144 = 576 \text{ almonds}
   \]

4. **Determine how many more bowls are needed**:
   We know the total capacity of the bowls and the remaining table is 240 almonds, but Carlos has 576 almonds left. We need to find out how many more bowls are required to hold all 576 almonds.
   First, we find out how many almonds can be held in the current setup:
   \[
   \text{Current capacity} = 240 \text{ almonds}
   \]
   Now, we calculate how many more almonds need to be accommodated:
   \[
   \text{Almonds needing accommodation} = 576 - 240 = 336 \text{ almonds}
   \]

5. **Calculate how many additional bowls are needed**:
   Each bowl holds 24 almonds, so the number of additional bowls needed is:
   \[
   \text{Additional bowls needed} = \frac{336}{24} = 14 \text{ bowls}

What will be the average of all four in 4 years?",25.0,"To solve the problem, we will first determine the ages of Diego, Aisha, Esteban, and Nadia at the relevant times, and then calculate the average of their ages in 4 years.

1. **Diego's current age**: 
   - Diego is currently 19 years old.

2. **Aisha's age in 9 years**: 
   - In 9 years, Diego will be \(19 + 9 = 28\) years old.
   - According to the problem, Aisha will be 2 times Diego's current age in 9 years. Diego's current age is 19, so:
   \[
   \text{Aisha's age in 9 years} = 2 \times 19 = 38 \text{ years old}

Now we have the current ages of all four individuals:
- Diego: 19 years
- Aisha: 29 years
- Esteban: 13 years
- Nadia: 23 years

5. **Ages in 4 years**:
   - Diego's age in 4 years: \(19 + 4 = 23\)
   - Aisha's age in 4 years: \(29 + 4 = 33\)
   - Esteban's age in 4 years: \(13 + 4 = 17\)
   - Nadia's age in 4 years: \(23 + 4 = 27\)

6. **Calculating the average age in 4 years**:

She wants to make a shawl, sweater, poncho, gloves, and mittens for each of them. It takes 5 skeins of wool to make a shawl, 6 for a sweater, 8 for a poncho, 8 for a pair of gloves, and 14 for a pair of mittens. Keisha wants to make two warm jackets for herself, each needing 8 skeins of wool. Each dozen skeins of wool costs $7. The store has a promotion where customers receive a $20 discount on purchases over $100. How much should Keisha pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?",85.0,"To find out how much Keisha should pay for all the skeins of wool she needs, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed for the grandchildren's items.**
   - For each grandchild, the skeins needed are:
     - Shawl: 5 skeins
     - Sweater: 6 skeins
     - Poncho: 8 skeins
     - Gloves: 8 skeins
     - Mittens: 14 skeins
   - Total skeins for one grandchild:
     \[
     5 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 14 = 41 \text{ skeins}
     \]
   - Since there are 4 grandchildren:
     \[
     41 \times 4 = 164 \text{ skeins}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed for Keisha's jackets.**
   - Each jacket requires 8 skeins, and she wants to make 2 jackets:
     \[
     8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ skeins}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed overall.**
   - Total skeins for grandchildren and Keisha:
     \[
     164 + 16 = 180 \text{ skeins}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the skeins of wool.**
   - Each dozen skeins costs $7. First, we need to find out how many dozens are in 180 skeins:
     \[
     \frac{180}{12} = 15 \text{ dozens}
     \]
   - The cost for 15 dozens:
     \[
     15 \times 7 = 105 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Apply the discount if applicable.**
   - Since the total cost of $105 is over $100, Keisha qualifies for a $20 discount:
     \[
     105 - 20 = 85 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount Keisha should pay for all the skeins of wool she needs is **$85**.",85.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the total skeins of wool needed for the grandchildren:**
   - For each grandchild, the wool needed is:

     \( 164 + 16 = 180 \) skeins.

4. **Calculate the cost of the skeins of wool:**
   - Each dozen skeins costs $7. 
   - First, find out how many dozens are in 180 skeins:
     \( 180 \div 12 = 15 \) dozens.
   - Now, calculate the cost:
     \( 15 \times 7 = 105 \) dollars.

5. **Check if the discount applies:**
   - The total cost is $105, which is over $100, so Keisha qualifies for the $20 discount.

6. **Calculate the final amount to pay:**
   - Subtract the discount from the total cost:

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,Mohammed goes to the store to buy some rice. The normal brand of rice he buys costs ¥15 per kg. He has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 3 kgs of rice per day. The store has a 40% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kgs; any additional rice is sold at the regular price. Mohammed also decides to buy himself a bagel for ¥2. How much does Mohammed have to pay?,308.0,"To find out how much Mohammed has to pay, we can break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice:**
   - The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg.
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more:
     \[
     \text{More expensive brand cost} = 15 + (0.20 \times 15) = 15 + 3 = ¥18 \text{ per kg}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of rice he needs for a week:**
   - Mohammed uses 3 kg of rice per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he needs:
     \[
     \text{Total rice needed} = 3 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ kg}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the first 10 kg of rice with the discount:**
   - The store has a 40% discount on the first 10 kg:
     \[
     \text{Discounted price per kg} = 18 - (0.40 \times 18) = 18 - 7.2 = ¥10.8 \text{ per kg}
     \]
   - The cost for the first 10 kg:
     \[
     \text{Cost for 10 kg} = 10 \text{ kg} \times 10.8 = ¥108
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the remaining rice (11 kg) at the regular price:**
   - The remaining rice needed is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining rice} = 21 \text{ kg} - 10 \text{ kg} = 11 \text{ kg}
     \]
   - The cost for the remaining 11 kg at the regular price of ¥18 per kg:
     \[
     \text{Cost for 11 kg} = 11 \text{ kg} \times 18 = ¥198
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the rice:**
   - Total cost of rice:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of rice} = 108 + 198 = ¥306
     \]

6. **Add the cost of the bagel:**
   - The cost of the bagel is ¥2.
   - Total cost including the bagel:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 306 + 2 = ¥308
     \]

Therefore, the total amount Mohammed has to pay is **¥308**.",308.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice:**
   - The normal brand costs ¥15 per kg.
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more.
   - 20% of ¥15 is \( 0.20 \times 15 = ¥3 \).
   - Therefore, the cost of the more expensive brand is \( 15 + 3 = ¥18 \) per kg.

2. **Calculate the total amount of rice Mohammed needs for a week:**
   - Mohammed uses 3 kgs of rice per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he needs \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) kgs of rice.

3. **Calculate the cost of the first 10 kgs of rice with the discount:**
   - The store has a 40% discount on the first 10 kgs.
   - The cost of 10 kgs at ¥18 per kg is \( 10 \times 18 = ¥180 \).
   - The discount is \( 40\% \) of ¥180, which is \( 0.40 \times 180 = ¥72 \).
   - Therefore, the cost after the discount for the first 10 kgs is \( 180 - 72 = ¥108 \).

4. **Calculate the cost of the remaining rice:**
   - Mohammed needs a total of 21 kgs, and he has already bought 10 kgs.
   - He needs an additional \( 21 - 10 = 11 \) kgs.
   - The cost for these 11 kgs at the regular price of ¥18 per kg is \( 11 \times 18 = ¥198 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the rice:**
   - The total cost for the rice is the cost of the first 10 kgs plus the cost of the additional 11 kgs:
   - Total cost = \( 108 + 198 = ¥306 \).

6. **Add the cost of the bagel:**
   - The bagel costs ¥2.
   - Therefore, the total amount Mohammed has to pay is \( 306 + 2 = ¥308 \).

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Jasmine and Mia are sisters from Nairobi who love collecting signatures from authors. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Jasmine and Mia compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Jasmine has 36 signatures in her book, and Mia has 31. The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Jasmine is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Mia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Mia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?",34.0,"To find out how many signatures Mia needs to collect per week to reach their goal of 145 signatures, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total signatures they currently have:**
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   - Mia has 31 signatures.
   - Total signatures = 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

2. **Determine how many more signatures they need to reach their goal:**
   - Their goal is 145 signatures.
   - Signatures needed = 145 - 67 = 78 signatures.

3. **Determine Jasmine's collection over the next 2 weeks:**
   - Jasmine's current weekly collection is not explicitly given, but we know that she will collect 5 fewer signatures per week than she normally would.
   - Let's denote Jasmine's normal weekly collection as \( J \).
   - In the next 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect signatures only on weekends, which means she will collect \( J - 5 \) signatures each week.
   - Therefore, in 2 weeks, Jasmine will collect \( 2(J - 5) = 2J - 10 \) signatures.

4. **Calculate Mia's required collection:**
   - Let \( M \) be the number of signatures Mia collects per week.
   - In 2 weeks, Mia will collect \( 2M \) signatures.
   - The total signatures collected by both sisters in the next 2 weeks will be:
     \[
     (2J - 10) + 2M
     \]
   - We want this total to equal the 78 signatures they need:
     \[
     (2J - 10) + 2M = 78
     \]

5. **Rearranging the equation:**
   - Rearranging gives us:
     \[
     2M = 78 - (2J - 10)
     \]
     \[
     2M = 78 - 2J + 10
     \]
     \[
     2M = 88 - 2J
     \]
     \[
     M = 44 - J
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Mia needs to collect \( 44 - J \) signatures per week, where \( J \) is Jasmine's normal weekly collection. Since we do not have the exact value of \( J \), we can express Mia's required collection in terms of Jasmine's normal collection.

If we assume Jasmine's normal weekly collection \( J \) is a reasonable number (for example, if she normally collects 15 signatures per week), we can substitute that value in to find Mia's required collection:

- If \( J = 15 \):
  \[
  M = 44 - 15 = 29
  \]

Thus, Mia would need to collect 29 signatures per week if Jasmine normally collects 15 signatures per week. You can adjust \( J \) based on any other reasonable assumption to find different values for \( M \).",15.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Current Signatures**: 
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   - Mia has 31 signatures.
   - Together, they have 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

2. **Goal**: 
   - They want to reach a total of 145 signatures.

3. **Signatures Needed**: 
   - To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the current total from their goal: 
   - 145 - 67 = 78 signatures needed.

4. **Remaining Time**: 
   - They have 2 more weeks of spring break.

5. **Jasmine's Collection**: 
   - Jasmine can only collect signatures on weekends, and her weekly collection is reduced by 5 signatures per week.
   - Let's assume Jasmine originally collected \( x \) signatures per week. 
   - Therefore, in the remaining 2 weeks, she will collect: 
   - (x - 5) + (x - 5) = 2(x - 5) = 2x - 10 signatures.

6. **Mia's Collection**: 
   - Let \( y \) be the number of signatures Mia needs to collect per week.
   - In 2 weeks, Mia will collect: 
   - 2y signatures.

7. **Total Signatures Collected in 2 Weeks**: 
   - The total signatures collected by both sisters in the remaining 2 weeks will be:
   - (2x - 10) + 2y.

8. **Setting Up the Equation**: 
   - We want the total signatures collected in the remaining 2 weeks to equal the signatures needed:
   - (2x - 10) + 2y = 78.

9. **Solving for Mia's Collection**: 
   - Rearranging the equation gives us:
   - 2y = 78 - (2x - 10)
   - 2y = 78 - 2x + 10
   - 2y = 88 - 2x.

10. **Dividing by 2**: 
    - y = 44 - x.

11. **Conclusion**: 
    - Mia needs to collect \( 44 - x \) signatures per week, where \( x \) is Jasmine's original weekly collection. 
    - Since we don't have the exact value of \( x \), we can conclude that Mia's required collection depends on Jasmine's original collection rate.

The answer is that Mia needs to collect \( 44 - x \) signatures per week, where \( x \) is Jasmine's original weekly collection.",44.0,0,1,0,24.0,"--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

[Example Input]
Question: Alex and Jamie are friends who enjoy playing video games. Over the summer, they decide to keep track of their high scores. After 4 weeks, Alex has a score of 1200 points, and Jamie has a score of 1500 points. They have 3 more weeks to improve their scores and want to reach a combined total of 5000 points. Alex can only increase his score by 100 points per week, while Jamie can increase hers by 200 points per week. How many points does Jamie need to score in total to ensure they reach their goal?

Wrong answer: I calculated that Jamie needs to score 200 points per week, but I forgot to account for Alex's total score increase over the 3 weeks, which is 300 points. Therefore, I miscalculated the total points needed.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total points needed by not considering the increase in Alex's score over the remaining weeks. I should have added his potential score increase to his current score before calculating the total needed from Jamie.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Ignoring contributions
- Incorrect total

Instructions:
1. Identify the current scores of both individuals.
2. Determine the total score they need to reach.
3. Calculate the total score increase for each individual based on their weekly increase and the number of weeks remaining.
4. Subtract the total score increase from the target score to find out how much more is needed.
5. Divide the remaining score needed by the number of weeks to find the required weekly score for the individual.

Advice:
- Always double-check the contributions of all parties involved in a problem.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid missing key details.
- Write down all calculations clearly to track your thought process.

Solution:
Alex's current score is 1200, and he will increase by 300 points over 3 weeks, bringing his total to 1500 points. Jamie's current score is 1500, so together they will have 3000 points. To reach 5000 points, they need an additional 2000 points. Since Alex will contribute 300 points, Jamie needs to score 1700 points in total. Over 3 weeks, Jamie needs to score approximately 567 points per week to reach the goal.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I miscalculated the total number of signatures needed and did not properly account for Jasmine's reduced collection rate. I failed to consider how many signatures Jasmine would collect over the remaining weeks and how that would affect the total needed from Mia.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Ignoring constraints
- Incorrect total

### Solution:
1. **Identify Current Signatures:**
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   - Mia has 31 signatures.
   - Total signatures currently = 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

2. **Determine Total Signatures Needed:**
   - They want to reach a combined total of 145 signatures.

3. **Calculate Signatures Needed:**
   - Total signatures needed = 145 - 67 = 78 signatures.

4. **Calculate Jasmine's Contribution:**
   - Jasmine can collect signatures on weekends only, which means she will collect 5 fewer signatures per week.
   - If she normally collects \( x \) signatures per week, her new collection rate is \( x - 5 \).
   - Over 2 weeks, she will collect \( 2(x - 5) \) signatures.

5. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( y \) be the number of signatures Mia collects per week.
   - Over 2 weeks, Mia will collect \( 2y \) signatures.
   - The total signatures collected by both sisters must equal 78:
     \[
     2(x - 5) + 2y = 78
     \]

6. **Assuming Jasmine's Normal Collection Rate:**
   - If we assume Jasmine normally collects 20 signatures per week (for example), then:
     \[
     2(20 - 5) + 2y = 78
     \]
     \[
     2(15) + 2y = 78
     \]
     \[
     30 + 2y = 78
     \]
     \[
     2y = 48
     \]
     \[
     y = 24
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Mia needs to collect 24 signatures per week to ensure they reach their goal.

Alex's current score is 1200, and he will increase by 300 points over 3 weeks, bringing his total to 1500 points. Jamie's current score is 1500, so together they will have 3000 points. To reach 5000 points, they need an additional 2000 points. Since Alex will contribute 300 points, Jamie needs to score 1700 points in total. Over 3 weeks, Jamie needs to score approximately 567 points per week to reach the goal.

[Example Input]
Question: Alex and Jamie are friends who enjoy playing video games. After 4 weeks of summer vacation, they decide to compare their scores. Alex has scored 80 points, while Jamie has scored 70 points. They have 3 more weeks of vacation, and they want to reach a total of 300 points together by the end of the vacation. However, during the remaining weeks, Alex can only score 10 points less each week due to a new game distraction, while Jamie plans to increase her score by 15 points each week. How many points will Jamie need to score each week to ensure they reach their goal?

Wrong answer: I calculated that Jamie needs to score 30 points each week. I mistakenly added Alex's current score to the total goal and then divided by the number of weeks without considering Alex's reduced scoring.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total points needed by not accounting for Alex's reduced scoring and incorrectly divided the remaining points by the number of weeks.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect division
- Ignoring constraints

Instructions:
1. Identify the current scores of both players.
2. Determine the total points needed to reach the goal.
3. Calculate how many points Alex will score in the remaining weeks based on his reduced scoring.
4. Subtract Alex's projected score from the total goal to find out how many points Jamie needs to score.
5. Divide the points Jamie needs by the number of weeks remaining to find her weekly target.

Advice:
- Always double-check the constraints given in the problem.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion.
- Keep track of each player's contributions separately to ensure accuracy.

Solution:
Alex currently has 80 points, and Jamie has 70 points, totaling 150 points. They need 300 points, so they need 150 more points. Alex will score 10 points less each week, so in 3 weeks, he will score 3 * (10 - 10) = 0 points. Jamie needs to score 150 points in 3 weeks, which means she needs to score 150 / 3 = 50 points per week.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I miscalculated the total number of signatures needed by not properly accounting for Jasmine's reduced collection rate and incorrectly calculated Mia's required weekly collection. I also failed to break down the problem into manageable parts, leading to confusion in my calculations.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect assumptions
- Ignoring constraints

### Solution:
1. **Identify Current Signatures:**
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   - Mia has 31 signatures.
   - Total signatures currently = 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

2. **Determine Total Signatures Needed:**
   - They want to reach a total of 145 signatures.
   - Signatures needed = 145 - 67 = 78 signatures.

3. **Calculate Jasmine's Projected Signatures:**
   - Jasmine can collect signatures for 2 more weeks but will collect 5 signatures less each week.
   - If we assume she normally collects \( x \) signatures per week, her new collection will be \( x - 5 \).
   - In 2 weeks, she will collect \( 2(x - 5) \).

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( y \) be the number of signatures Mia collects per week.
   - In 2 weeks, Mia will collect \( 2y \).
   - The total signatures collected by both sisters in the remaining weeks will be:
     \[
     2(x - 5) + 2y = 78
     \]

5. **Solve for Mia's Weekly Collection:**
   - We need to express \( x \) in terms of known values. Since we don't have \( x \), we can assume Jasmine's original collection rate is not provided, but we can still solve for \( y \) based on the total needed.
   - Rearranging the equation gives:
     \[
     2y = 78 - 2(x - 5)
     \]
     \[
     2y = 78 - 2x + 10
     \]
     \[
     2y = 88 - 2x
     \]
     \[
     y = 44 - x
     \]

6. **Assuming Jasmine's Original Rate:**
   - If we assume Jasmine originally collected 15 signatures per week (as a reasonable estimate), then:
     \[
     y = 44 - 15 = 29
     \]
   - Therefore, Mia needs to collect **29 signatures per week**.

### Instructions:
1. Identify the current totals for both individuals.
2. Determine the total goal and how many more signatures are needed.
3. Calculate how many signatures each person can collect in the remaining time, considering any constraints.
4. Set up an equation based on the total signatures needed and the contributions from both individuals.
5. Solve for the unknown variable representing the required collection rate.

### General Advice:
- Always clarify the constraints and changes in collection rates before starting calculations.
- Break the problem down into smaller, manageable parts to avoid confusion.
- Use reasonable assumptions when specific rates are not provided, but ensure they align with the context of the problem.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

Explanation:
I miscalculated the total points needed by not considering Alex's reduced scoring. I also failed to properly set up the equation to find Jamie's required weekly score.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect addition
- Failure to account for changes in scoring

Instructions:
1. Identify the current scores of both players.
2. Determine the total points needed to reach the goal.
3. Calculate how many points each player will score in the remaining weeks based on their individual scoring changes.
4. Set up an equation to find the required score for the player who needs to increase their score.

Advice:
- Always double-check the changes in scoring for each participant.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion.
- Write down all known values and what you need to find before starting calculations.

Solution:
Alex currently has 80 points and will score 10 points less each week for 3 weeks, totaling 60 points. Jamie needs to score enough to reach a total of 300 points. Therefore, Jamie's score must be 300 - (80 + 60) = 160 points. Dividing this by 3 weeks, Jamie needs to score approximately 53.33 points per week. Since she can't score a fraction of a point, she should aim for at least 54 points each week.

I initially miscalculated the total number of signatures needed and did not properly account for Jasmine's reduced collection rate. I also failed to set up the equation correctly to find Mia's required weekly collection.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect total
- Failure to account for changes in collection rates

### Solution:
1. **Identify Current Signatures:**
   - Jasmine has 36 signatures.
   - Mia has 31 signatures.

2. **Calculate Total Current Signatures:**
   - Total signatures = Jasmine's signatures + Mia's signatures = 36 + 31 = 67 signatures.

3. **Determine Total Signatures Needed:**
   - They want to reach a total of 145 signatures.

4. **Calculate Signatures Needed to Reach Goal:**
   - Signatures needed = Total goal - Total current signatures = 145 - 67 = 78 signatures.

5. **Calculate Jasmine's Collection Over 2 Weeks:**
   - Jasmine's weekly collection is reduced by 5 signatures per week. Assuming she originally collected a certain number of signatures (let's denote it as J), her new collection for 2 weeks would be:
     - Week 1: J - 5
     - Week 2: J - 5
   - Total signatures collected by Jasmine in 2 weeks = (J - 5) + (J - 5) = 2J - 10.

6. **Set Up the Equation for Mia's Collection:**
   - Let M be the number of signatures Mia collects per week. Over 2 weeks, Mia will collect 2M signatures.
   - The total signatures collected by both sisters must equal the signatures needed:
     - Total signatures = Jasmine's collection + Mia's collection
     - 78 = (2J - 10) + 2M.

7. **Assuming Jasmine's Original Weekly Collection:**
   - If we assume Jasmine originally collected 15 signatures per week (as an example), then:
     - J = 15
     - Jasmine's total collection over 2 weeks = 2(15) - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 signatures.
   - Now substituting into the equation:
     - 78 = 20 + 2M
     - 2M = 78 - 20
     - 2M = 58
     - M = 29.

### Final Answer:
Mia needs to collect **29 signatures per week** to ensure they reach their goal.

### Instructions for Future Problems:
1. Identify and write down the current totals for each participant.
2. Determine the total goal and calculate how many more signatures are needed.
3. Understand the changes in collection rates for each participant.
4. Set up an equation that incorporates the changes in collection rates.
5. Solve the equation step-by-step to find the required collection for the participant who needs to increase their score.

### General Advice for Similar Problems:
- Always double-check the initial conditions and changes in rates.
- Break down the problem into manageable parts and write down each step.
- Use variables to represent unknowns and set up equations clearly.

It takes them 16 minutes to get to the corner where the cinema is. It takes them another 52 minutes to get to the gym. When they reach the gym, they remember they forgot their wallets at home, so they have to return to pick up their wallets and then walk all the way back to the gym again. Once they reach the gym for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the mall without being late?",42.0,"To find out how much time Sofia and Benjamin have left to get to the mall after returning to the gym, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Time to the cinema**: 16 minutes
2. **Time from the cinema to the gym**: 52 minutes

First, we calculate the total time taken to reach the gym the first time:

\[
\text{Total time to gym (first time)} = 16 \text{ minutes} + 52 \text{ minutes} = 68 \text{ minutes}
\]

3. **Time to return home from the gym**: Since it takes the same amount of time to return, it will also take 68 minutes to go back home.

4. **Time to go back to the gym again**: This will again take 68 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total time spent so far:

\[
\text{Total time spent} = 68 \text{ minutes (to gym)} + 68 \text{ minutes (return home)} + 68 \text{ minutes (to gym again)} = 204 \text{ minutes}
\]

5. **Total time available**: They initially had 246 minutes to get to the mall.

6. **Time remaining after reaching the gym for the second time**:

\[
\text{Time remaining} = 246 \text{ minutes} - 204 \text{ minutes} = 42 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, after reaching the gym for the second time, Sofia and Benjamin have **42 minutes** left to get to the mall without being late.",42.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Sofia and Benjamin have a total of 246 minutes to walk to the mall.
2. It takes them 16 minutes to get to the corner where the cinema is.
3. After that, it takes them another 52 minutes to get to the gym.
4. So, the total time taken to reach the gym the first time is:
   \[
   16 + 52 = 68 \text{ minutes}
   \]
5. Now, they realize they forgot their wallets at home, so they need to return home. The time taken to return to their home is the same as the time taken to get to the gym, which is 52 minutes.
6. Therefore, the time taken to return home is:
   \[
   52 \text{ minutes}
   \]
7. After picking up their wallets, they need to walk back to the gym again, which takes another 52 minutes.
8. So, the total time taken for the round trip (home to gym and back) is:
   \[
   52 + 52 = 104 \text{ minutes}
   \]
9. Now, we add the time taken to reach the gym the first time (68 minutes) to the round trip time (104 minutes):
   \[
   68 + 104 = 172 \text{ minutes}
   \]
10. Now, we subtract this total time from the initial 246 minutes they had:
    \[
    246 - 172 = 74 \text{ minutes}
    \]
11. This means they have 74 minutes left to get to the mall.

- Always break down the problem into smaller steps to ensure clarity.
- Double-check calculations, especially when there are multiple trips involved.
- Keep track of the total time spent at each stage to avoid confusion.
Solution:
The correct reasoning is as follows: Total time spent = 20 (to park) + 40 (to library) + 20 (return to home) + 40 (return to library) = 120 minutes. Remaining time = 300 - 120 = 180 minutes. Therefore, they have 180 minutes left to get to the concert without being late.

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Leon wants to make different sized ice cubes with 312 ounces of water. He can make giant cubes that use 12 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 5 ounces, small cubes that use 1/2 of a ounce, and tiny cubes that are half the size of small cubes. He makes 48 total ice cubes, including 10 giant cubes, 14 small cubes, 12 medium cubes, and some tiny cubes. How many ounces of water does Leon have left?",122.0,"To find out how many ounces of water Leon has left after making the ice cubes, we first need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of ice cube he made.

1. **Calculate the water used for giant cubes:**
   - Number of giant cubes = 10
   - Water per giant cube = 12 ounces
   - Total water used for giant cubes = \(10 \times 12 = 120\) ounces

2. **Calculate the water used for medium cubes:**
   - Number of medium cubes = 12
   - Water per medium cube = 5 ounces
   - Total water used for medium cubes = \(12 \times 5 = 60\) ounces

3. **Calculate the water used for small cubes:**
   - Number of small cubes = 14
   - Water per small cube = 0.5 ounces
   - Total water used for small cubes = \(14 \times 0.5 = 7\) ounces

4. **Now, we need to find the total water used so far:**
   \[
   \text{Total water used} = \text{Water for giant cubes} + \text{Water for medium cubes} + \text{Water for small cubes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total water used} = 120 + 60 + 7 = 187 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total water used for tiny cubes:**
   - Let \(x\) be the number of tiny cubes.
   - Water per tiny cube = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 0.5 = 0.25\) ounces
   - Total water used for tiny cubes = \(x \times 0.25\) ounces

6. **Total number of ice cubes:**
   - Total ice cubes = 48
   - We already have 10 (giant) + 12 (medium) + 14 (small) = 36 cubes.
   - Therefore, the number of tiny cubes \(x = 48 - 36 = 12\).

7. **Calculate the water used for tiny cubes:**
   \[
   \text{Total water used for tiny cubes} = 12 \times 0.25 = 3 \text{ ounces}
   \]

8. **Calculate the total water used:**
   \[
   \text{Total water used} = 187 + 3 = 190 \text{ ounces}
   \]

9. **Calculate the remaining water:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining water} = \text{Initial water} - \text{Total water used}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining water} = 312 - 190 = 122 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Thus, Leon has **122 ounces of water left**.",122.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Total water available**: Leon starts with 312 ounces of water.

2. **Calculating water used for giant cubes**:
   - Each giant cube uses 12 ounces.
   - Leon makes 10 giant cubes.
   - So, the total water used for giant cubes is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cubes} \times 12 \text{ ounces/cube} = 120 \text{ ounces}
     \]

3. **Calculating water used for medium cubes**:
   - Each medium cube uses 5 ounces.
   - Leon makes 12 medium cubes.
   - So, the total water used for medium cubes is:
     \[
     12 \text{ cubes} \times 5 \text{ ounces/cube} = 60 \text{ ounces}
     \]

4. **Calculating water used for small cubes**:
   - Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces (which is 1/2 ounce).
   - Leon makes 14 small cubes.
   - So, the total water used for small cubes is:
     \[
     14 \text{ cubes} \times 0.5 \text{ ounces/cube} = 7 \text{ ounces}
     \]

5. **Calculating total water used**:
   - Now, we add the water used for all types of cubes:
     \[
     120 \text{ ounces (giant)} + 60 \text{ ounces (medium)} + 7 \text{ ounces (small)} = 187 \text{ ounces}
     \]

6. **Calculating water left**:
   - To find out how much water Leon has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:
     \[
     312 \text{ ounces} - 187 \text{ ounces} = 125 \text{ ounces}

[Example Input]
Question: Sarah has 250 ounces of juice. She can make large drinks that use 20 ounces each, medium drinks that use 8 ounces each, and small drinks that use 2 ounces each. She makes 30 total drinks, including 5 large drinks, 10 small drinks, and some medium drinks. How many ounces of juice does Sarah have left?
Wrong answer: I calculated that Sarah used 100 ounces for the large drinks and 20 ounces for the small drinks, which totals 120 ounces. I then subtracted this from 250 ounces and got 130 ounces left. I forgot to account for the medium drinks she made.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total amount of juice used by not including the medium drinks in my calculations. I only considered the large and small drinks, which led to an incorrect total.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Omission
- Resource allocation

Instructions:
1. Identify the total amount of resource available (in this case, juice).
2. Determine the number of each type of drink made and the amount of juice each type uses.
3. Calculate the total amount of juice used for each type of drink.
4. Sum the total juice used for all types of drinks.
5. Subtract the total juice used from the initial amount to find the remaining juice.

Advice:
- Always double-check that you have accounted for all categories in multi-part problems.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to ensure clarity in calculations.
- Keep track of units and conversions to avoid errors in resource allocation.

Solution:
Sarah made 5 large drinks (5 x 20 = 100 ounces), 10 small drinks (10 x 2 = 20 ounces), and let’s say she made x medium drinks (x x 8 ounces). The total number of drinks is 30, so 5 + 10 + x = 30, which means x = 15 medium drinks. The total juice used is 100 + 20 + (15 x 8) = 100 + 20 + 120 = 240 ounces. Therefore, Sarah has 250 - 240 = 10 ounces of juice left.

Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 125.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I miscalculated the total amount of water used by not properly accounting for the tiny cubes. I only considered the giant, medium, and small cubes, which led to an incorrect total. Additionally, I may have made an error in calculating the total number of cubes and their respective water usage.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Omission
- Resource allocation
- Incorrect summation

### Solution:
1. **Identify the total amount of water available**: 312 ounces.
2. **Determine the number of each type of ice cube made**:
   - Giant cubes: 10
   - Medium cubes: 12
   - Small cubes: 14
   - Tiny cubes: Let’s denote the number of tiny cubes as \( x \).
3. **Calculate the amount of water used for each type of ice cube**:
   - Giant cubes: \( 10 \times 12 = 120 \) ounces
   - Medium cubes: \( 12 \times 5 = 60 \) ounces
   - Small cubes: \( 14 \times 0.5 = 7 \) ounces
   - Tiny cubes: Each tiny cube uses \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a small cube, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 0.5 = 0.25 \) ounces. Therefore, the total for tiny cubes is \( x \times 0.25 \) ounces.
4. **Set up the equation for the total number of ice cubes**:
   \[
   10 + 12 + 14 + x = 48
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   36 + x = 48 \implies x = 12
   \]
5. **Calculate the total amount of water used**:
   - Total water used = Water used for giant cubes + medium cubes + small cubes + tiny cubes
   \[
   = 120 + 60 + 7 + (12 \times 0.25)
   \]
   \[
   = 120 + 60 + 7 + 3 = 190 \text{ ounces}
   \]
6. **Subtract the total water used from the initial amount**:
   \[
   312 - 190 = 122 \text{ ounces}
   \]

### Final Answer:
Leon has **122 ounces** of water left.

### Instructions:
1. Identify the total amount of resource available (in this case, water).
2. Determine the number of each type of item made and the amount of resource each type uses.
3. Calculate the total amount of resource used for each type of item.
4. Set up an equation to find any unknown quantities (if applicable).
5. Sum the total resource used for all types of items.
6. Subtract the total resource used from the initial amount to find the remaining resource.

2. Determine the number of each type of drink made and the amount of juice each type uses.
3. Calculate the total amount of juice used for each type of drink.
4. Sum the total juice used for all types of drinks.
5. Subtract the total juice used from the initial amount to find the remaining juice.

Advice:
- Always double-check that you have accounted for all categories in multi-part problems.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to ensure clarity in calculations.
- Keep track of units and conversions to avoid errors in resource allocation.

Solution:
Sarah made 5 large drinks (5 x 20 = 100 ounces), 10 small drinks (10 x 2 = 20 ounces), and let’s say she made x medium drinks (x x 8 ounces). The total number of drinks is 30, so 5 + 10 + x = 30, which means x = 15 medium drinks. The total juice used is 100 + 20 + (15 x 8) = 100 + 20 + 120 = 240 ounces. Therefore, Sarah has 250 - 240 = 10 ounces of juice left.

What percentage of the students like to play video games if the number of the students that like to bake is 3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football?",5.0,"To find the percentage of students who like to play video games, we first need to determine how many students like to bake and how many like to play video games.

1. **Identify the number of students who like to play football:**
   - The number of students who like to play football is given as 13.

2. **Calculate the number of students who like to bake:**
   - According to the problem, the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number of students who like to play football.
   - Therefore, we can calculate the number of students who like to bake as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of students who like to bake} = 4 \times 13 - 3 = 52 - 3 = 49
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of students who like hiking, chess, swimming, football, and baking:**
   - We know the following:
     - Students who like hiking: 69
     - Students who like chess: 8
     - Students who like swimming: 13
     - Students who like football: 13
     - Students who like baking: 49
   - Now, we can sum these numbers:
     \[
     \text{Total students with known hobbies} = 69 + 8 + 13 + 13 + 49 = 152
     \]

4. **Determine the number of students who like to play video games:**
   - The total number of students in the class is 160. Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is:
     \[
     \text{Number of students who like video games} = 160 - 152 = 8
     \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of students who like to play video games:**
   - To find the percentage, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of students who like video games}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values we have:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{8}{160} \right) \times 100 = 5\%
     \]

Thus, the percentage of students who like to play video games is \( \boxed{5\%} \).",5.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. We start with a class of 160 students.
2. The number of students who like to hike is 69.
3. The number of students who like to play chess is 8.
4. The number of students who like to swim is 13.
5. The number of students who like to play football is 13.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who have specified hobbies:

- Total students with specified hobbies = 69 (hiking) + 8 (chess) + 13 (swimming) + 13 (football)
- Total students with specified hobbies = 69 + 8 + 13 + 13 = 103

Next, we find out how many students are left who like either to play video games or bake:

- Students who like video games or bake = Total students - Students with specified hobbies
- Students who like video games or bake = 160 - 103 = 57

Now, we need to determine how many students like to bake. We know that the number of students who like to bake is 3 less than four times the number of students who like to play football:

- Number of students who like to play football = 13
- Four times the number of students who like to play football = 4 * 13 = 52
- Therefore, the number of students who like to bake = 52 - 3 = 49

Now, we can find the number of students who like to play video games:

- Students who like video games = Students who like video games or bake - Students who like to bake
- Students who like video games = 57 - 49 = 8

Finally, we calculate the percentage of students who like to play video games:

- Percentage of students who like to play video games = (Number of students who like video games / Total students) * 100
- Percentage of students who like to play video games = (8 / 160) * 100 = 5%

The bakery has a promotion that if one buys 7 bagels or more, they get a 20% discount on bagels. How much more do 4 loaves of bread cost than 8 bagels?",12.0,"To find out how much more 4 loaves of bread cost than 8 bagels, we will first calculate the cost of the bagels, including any applicable discounts, and then compare it to the cost of the loaves of bread.

1. **Calculate the cost of a bagel:**
   The cost of a loaf of bread is €5. The cost of a bagel is one-fourth of a loaf of bread:
   \[
   \text{Cost of a bagel} = \frac{1}{4} \times 5 = \frac{5}{4} = 1.25 \text{ euros}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of 8 bagels:**
   The cost of 8 bagels without any discount is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 8 bagels} = 8 \times 1.25 = 10 \text{ euros}
   \]

3. **Check if the discount applies:**
   Since the bakery has a promotion that gives a 20% discount on bagels if you buy 7 or more, we will apply this discount to the cost of 8 bagels.
   The discount amount is:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 20\% \text{ of } 10 = 0.20 \times 10 = 2 \text{ euros}

- \(48 + 96 = 144\)
- \(144 + 12 = 156\)
- \(156 + 72 = 228\)
- \(228 + 29 = 257\)

So, Gabrielle has a total of 257 items before adding the bouncy balls.

Now, we know that the total number of items after adding the bouncy balls is 320. Let \(x\) be the number of bouncy balls. We can set up the equation:

\[
257 + x = 320
\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 257 from both sides:

\[
x = 320 - 257
\]
\[
x = 63
\]

Thus, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is \(\boxed{63}\).",63.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Count the building blocks**: Gabrielle has 43 blocks.
2. **Count the stuffed animals**: She has 5 stuffed animals.
3. **Calculate the total number of blocks and stuffed animals**: 
   \[
   43 + 5 = 48
   \]
4. **Calculate the number of action figures**: The number of action figures is twice the total of blocks and stuffed animals:
   \[
   2 \times 48 = 96
   \]
5. **Count the crayons**: The crayon box has 12 different colors of crayon.
6. **Count the stickers**: The sticker book has 6 pages, each with 12 stickers:
   \[
   6 \times 12 = 72
   \]
7. **Count the stacking rings**: There are 29 multicolored rings.
8. **Now, add all the items together**:
   - Building blocks: 43
   - Stuffed animals: 5
   - Action figures: 96
   - Crayons: 12
   - Stickers: 72
   - Stacking rings: 29

   So, the total number of items before adding the bouncy balls is:
   \[
   43 + 5 + 96 + 12 + 72 + 29 = 257
   \]
9. **Gabrielle's total number of items is 320**. To find out how many bouncy balls she bought, we subtract the total number of items before adding the bouncy balls from the total number of items:
   \[
   320 - 257 = 63
   \]

The answer is 63.",63.0,1,0,1,63.0,,,
p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"A care facility has a capacity of 1900 rooms with 1/4 occupied and one-fourth of all the rooms being out of service. Due to the pandemic, 20 patients are admitted into the care facility each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks.",530.0,"To find the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rooms that are out of service.**
   The care facility has a total of 1900 rooms, and one-fourth of these rooms are out of service:
   \[
   \text{Rooms out of service} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475 \text{ rooms}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of occupied rooms.**
   One-fourth of the total rooms are occupied:
   \[
   \text{Occupied rooms} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475 \text{ rooms}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of rooms that are available for occupancy.**
   The total number of rooms available for occupancy is the total number of rooms minus the rooms that are out of service:
   \[
   \text{Available rooms} = 1900 - 475 = 1425 \text{ rooms}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of unoccupied rooms initially.**
   The number of unoccupied rooms is the available rooms minus the occupied rooms:
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied rooms} = 1425 - 475 = 950 \text{ rooms}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of patients admitted over 3 weeks.**
   There are 7 days in a week, so in 3 weeks, there are:
   \[
   \text{Total days} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days}
   \]
   With 20 patients admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted in 3 weeks is:
   \[
   \text{Total patients admitted} = 20 \times 21 = 420 \text{ patients}
   \]

6. **Calculate the new number of occupied rooms after 3 weeks.**
   The new number of occupied rooms will be the initial occupied rooms plus the number of patients admitted:
   \[
   \text{New occupied rooms} = 475 + 420 = 895 \text{ rooms}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks.**
   The total number of unoccupied rooms is the available rooms minus the new occupied rooms:
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks} = 1425 - 895 = 530 \text{ rooms}
   \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 3 weeks is **530 rooms**.",530.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. The total capacity of the care facility is 1900 rooms.
2. One-fourth of the rooms are occupied. So, the number of occupied rooms is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475 \text{ rooms}
   \]
3. One-fourth of all the rooms are out of service. So, the number of rooms out of service is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1900 = 475 \text{ rooms}
   \]
4. Now, we can calculate the total number of rooms that are either occupied or out of service:
   \[
   475 \text{ (occupied)} + 475 \text{ (out of service)} = 950 \text{ rooms}
   \]
5. To find the number of unoccupied rooms, we subtract the occupied and out of service rooms from the total capacity:
   \[
   1900 - 950 = 950 \text{ unoccupied rooms}
   \]
6. Next, we need to account for the 20 patients admitted each day for 3 weeks. First, we calculate the total number of days in 3 weeks:
   \[
   3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]
7. Now, we calculate the total number of patients admitted in 3 weeks:
   \[
   20 \text{ patients/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ patients}
   \]
8. Since these patients will occupy rooms, we need to subtract the number of patients from the unoccupied rooms:
   \[
   950 \text{ unoccupied rooms} - 420 \text{ patients} = 530 \text{ unoccupied rooms}

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Faisal is selling muffins and apricot pies for a fundraiser. On Wednesday, he sold 27 boxes of muffin and 13 fewer boxes of apricot pie, than on Thursday. On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday and 21 boxes of apricot pie. On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. If the muffin cost ₺9 and the apricot pie cost ₺21, what was Faisal's average daily earning?",796.0,"To find Faisal's average daily earning, we first need to determine how many boxes of muffins and apricot pies he sold on each day (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday).

### Step 1: Determine Sales on Wednesday
Let:
- \( m_W \) = number of muffin boxes sold on Wednesday
- \( a_W \) = number of apricot pie boxes sold on Wednesday

From the problem, we know:
- \( m_W = 27 \)
- \( a_W = m_W - 13 = 27 - 13 = 14 \)

### Step 2: Determine Sales on Thursday
Let:
- \( m_T \) = number of muffin boxes sold on Thursday
- \( a_T \) = number of apricot pie boxes sold on Thursday

From the problem, we know:
- \( m_T = m_W + 11 = 27 + 11 = 38 \)
- \( a_T = 21 \)

### Step 3: Determine Sales on Friday
On Friday, Faisal sold as much as he did on Wednesday and Thursday combined. 

Total sales from Wednesday:
- Muffins: \( m_W = 27 \)
- Apricot pies: \( a_W = 14 \)

Total sales from Thursday:
- Muffins: \( m_T = 38 \)
- Apricot pies: \( a_T = 21 \)

Calculating total sales for Wednesday:
\[
\text{Total Wednesday} = m_W + a_W = 27 + 14 = 41
\]

Calculating total sales for Thursday:
\[
\text{Total Thursday} = m_T + a_T = 38 + 21 = 59
\]

Now, combine the totals from both days:
\[
\text{Total for Wednesday and Thursday} = 41 + 59 = 100
\]

Thus, on Friday, Faisal sold:
- \( m_F + a_F = 100 \)

### Step 4: Calculate Earnings
Now we calculate the earnings for each day.

**Earnings on Wednesday:**
\[
\text{Earnings}_W = (m_W \times 9) + (a_W \times 21) = (27 \times 9) + (14 \times 21)
\]
Calculating:
\[
27 \times 9 = 243
\]
\[
14 \times 21 = 294
\]
\[
\text{Earnings}_W = 243 + 294 = 537
\]

**Earnings on Thursday:**
\[
\text{Earnings}_T = (m_T \times 9) + (a_T \times 21) = (38 \times 9) + (21 \times 21)
\]
Calculating:
\[
38 \times 9 = 342
\]
\[
21 \times 21 = 441
\]
\[
\text{Earnings}_T = 342 + 441 = 783
\]

**Earnings on Friday:**
Since he sold 100 boxes on Friday, we need to determine how many of each type he sold. However, we can calculate the total earnings directly since we know the total sales amount.

Let \( x \) be the number of muffin boxes sold on Friday and \( y \) be the number of apricot pies sold on Friday. We know:
\[
x + y = 100
\]
The earnings for Friday can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Earnings}_F = (x \times 9) + (y \times 21)
\]
We can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
y = 100 - x
\]
Substituting:
\[
\text{Earnings}_F = (x \times 9) + ((100 - x) \times 21)
\]
\[
= 9x + 2100 - 21x
\]
\[
= -12x + 2100
\]

To maximize earnings, we can assume he sold all muffins or all apricot pies, but since we need to find the average, we can calculate the total earnings based on the total sales.

### Step 5: Total Earnings
Now we can sum the earnings from all three days:
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Earnings}_W + \text{Earnings}_T + \text{Earnings}_F
\]
We can calculate \( \text{Earnings}_F \) by assuming he sold a mix of muffins and apricot pies. However, since we need the average, we can calculate it based on the total sales.

### Step 6: Average Daily Earnings
Total earnings from Wednesday and Thursday:
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = 537 + 783 + \text{Earnings}_F
\]
Assuming \( \text{Earnings}_F \) is maximized, we can calculate:
\[
\text{Earnings}_F = 100 \times 9 + 100 \times 21 = 900 + 2100 = 3000
\]
Thus:
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = 537 + 783 + 3000 = 4320
\]

Now, to find the average daily earnings over three days:
\[
\text{Average Daily Earnings} = \frac{\text{Total Earnings}}{3} = \frac{4320}{3} = 1440
\]

Thus, Faisal's average daily earning is **₺1440**.",1440.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the number of boxes sold on Wednesday:**
   - Faisal sold 27 boxes of muffins on Wednesday.
   - He sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pies than on Thursday. 

2. **Determine the number of boxes sold on Thursday:**
   - On Thursday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday.
   - So, the number of muffins sold on Thursday is:
     \[
     27 + 11 = 38 \text{ boxes}
     \]
   - He sold 21 boxes of apricot pies on Thursday.

3. **Calculate the number of apricot pies sold on Wednesday:**
   - Since he sold 13 fewer boxes of apricot pies on Wednesday than on Thursday:
     \[
     21 - 13 = 8 \text{ boxes}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total boxes sold on Wednesday and Thursday:**
   - On Wednesday, he sold:
     - Muffins: 27 boxes
     - Apricot pies: 8 boxes
   - On Thursday, he sold:
     - Muffins: 38 boxes
     - Apricot pies: 21 boxes

5. **Calculate the total boxes sold:**
   - Total boxes sold on Wednesday:
     \[
     27 + 8 = 35 \text{ boxes}
     \]
   - Total boxes sold on Thursday:
     \[
     38 + 21 = 59 \text{ boxes}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total boxes sold over the two days:**
   - Total boxes sold over Wednesday and Thursday:
     \[
     35 + 59 = 94 \text{ boxes}
     \]

7. **Determine the number of boxes sold on Friday:**
   - On Friday, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined:
     \[
     94 \text{ boxes}
     \]

8. **Calculate the total earnings for each day:**
   - **Earnings from muffins:**
     - Wednesday: \(27 \text{ boxes} \times ₺9 = ₺243\)
     - Thursday: \(38 \text{ boxes} \times ₺9 = ₺342\)
     - Friday: \(94 \text{ boxes} \times ₺9 = ₺846\)
   - **Earnings from apricot pies:**
     - Wednesday: \(8 \text{ boxes} \times ₺21 = ₺168\)
     - Thursday: \(21 \text{ boxes} \times ₺21 = ₺441\)
     - Friday: \(0 \text{ boxes} \times ₺21 = ₺0\) (since he sold only muffins on Friday)

9. **Calculate total earnings for each day:**
   - **Wednesday total earnings:**
     \[
     ₺243 + ₺168 = ₺411
     \]
   - **Thursday total earnings:**
     \[
     ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783
     \]
   - **Friday total earnings:**
     \[
     ₺846 + ₺0 = ₺846
     \]

10. **Calculate total earnings over the three days:**
    \[
    ₺411 + ₺783 + ₺846 = ₺2040
    \]

11. **Calculate the average daily earning:**
    - There are 3 days:

Question: Sarah is selling cookies and brownies for a school event. On Monday, she sold 15 boxes of cookies and 5 fewer boxes of brownies than on Tuesday. On Tuesday, she sold 10 more boxes of cookies than on Monday and 20 boxes of brownies. On Wednesday, she sold as much as she did in the past two days combined. If the cookie cost ₺5 and the brownie cost ₺10, what was Sarah's average daily earning?

Wrong answer: I calculated the total boxes sold incorrectly and ended up with the wrong average. I thought she sold 25 boxes of cookies on Tuesday instead of 20, which led to an incorrect total.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of boxes sold on Tuesday, which affected my total earnings calculation. I also failed to properly account for the combined sales on Wednesday.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect total
- Misunderstanding of relationships

Instructions:
1. Define variables for the number of boxes sold each day (e.g., C_Mon, B_Mon for cookies and brownies on Monday).
2. Set up equations based on the relationships given in the problem.
3. Solve the equations step-by-step to find the number of boxes sold each day.
4. Calculate the total earnings for each day using the prices provided.
5. Find the average daily earning by dividing the total earnings by the number of days.

Advice:
- Carefully read the problem to identify relationships between quantities.
- Write down equations clearly to avoid confusion.
- Double-check calculations at each step to catch any errors early.
- Practice similar problems to become familiar with the structure and common pitfalls.

Solution:
1. Let the number of boxes of cookies sold on Monday be C_Mon = 15, and the number of brownies be B_Mon = C_Mon - 5 = 10.
2. On Tuesday, C_Tue = C_Mon + 10 = 25, and B_Tue = 20.
3. On Wednesday, she sold C_Wed = C_Mon + C_Tue = 15 + 25 = 40, and B_Wed = B_Mon + B_Tue = 10 + 20 = 30.
4. Total earnings = (C_Mon * 5 + B_Mon * 10) + (C_Tue * 5 + B_Tue * 10) + (C_Wed * 5 + B_Wed * 10).
5. Average daily earning = Total earnings / 3.

Total earnings = (15 * 5 + 10 * 10) + (25 * 5 + 20 * 10) + (40 * 5 + 30 * 10) = 75 + 250 + 350 = 675.
Average daily earning = 675 / 3 = 225.

### Solution:
1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( M_W \) = number of muffins sold on Wednesday = 27
   - Let \( P_W \) = number of apricot pies sold on Wednesday
   - Let \( M_T \) = number of muffins sold on Thursday
   - Let \( P_T \) = number of apricot pies sold on Thursday
   - Let \( M_F \) = number of muffins sold on Friday
   - Let \( P_F \) = number of apricot pies sold on Friday

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know:
     - \( P_W = M_W - 13 = 27 - 13 = 14 \)
     - \( M_T = M_W + 11 = 27 + 11 = 38 \)
     - \( P_T = 21 \)
     - On Friday, he sold as much as he did on Wednesday and Thursday combined:
       - \( M_F = M_W + M_T = 27 + 38 = 65 \)
       - \( P_F = P_W + P_T = 14 + 21 = 35 \)

3. **Calculate Total Earnings:**
   - Earnings on Wednesday:
     \[
     E_W = (M_W \times 9) + (P_W \times 21) = (27 \times 9) + (14 \times 21) = 243 + 294 = 537
     \]
   - Earnings on Thursday:
     \[
     E_T = (M_T \times 9) + (P_T \times 21) = (38 \times 9) + (21 \times 21) = 342 + 441 = 783
     \]
   - Earnings on Friday:
     \[
     E_F = (M_F \times 9) + (P_F \times 21) = (65 \times 9) + (35 \times 21) = 585 + 735 = 1320
     \]

4. **Calculate Total Earnings Over Three Days:**
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = E_W + E_T + E_F = 537 + 783 + 1320 = 2640
   \]

5. **Calculate Average Daily Earning:**
   \[
   \text{Average Daily Earning} = \frac{\text{Total Earnings}}{3} = \frac{2640}{3} = 880
   \]

[Example Input]
Question: Sarah is selling cookies and brownies for a school event. On Monday, she sold 15 boxes of cookies and 5 fewer boxes of brownies than on Tuesday. On Tuesday, she sold 10 more boxes of cookies than on Monday and 20 boxes of brownies. On Wednesday, she sold as much as she did in the past two days combined. If the cookie cost ₺5 and the brownie cost ₺10, what was Sarah's average daily earning?

Wrong answer: I calculated the total boxes sold incorrectly. I thought she sold 25 boxes of cookies on Tuesday and 15 boxes of brownies, leading me to miscalculate the total earnings.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of boxes sold on Tuesday by not correctly applying the relationship between the boxes sold on Monday and Tuesday. I also failed to account for the total sales on Wednesday properly.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Incorrect application of relationships
- Arithmetic error

Instructions:
1. Carefully read the problem to identify the relationships between the quantities sold on different days.
2. Set up equations based on the information given for each day.
3. Calculate the number of boxes sold for each item on each day step-by-step.
4. Determine the total earnings for each day by multiplying the number of boxes sold by their respective prices.
5. Calculate the average daily earning by summing the total earnings and dividing by the number of days.

Advice:
- Always double-check the relationships between quantities in word problems.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion.
- Write down equations clearly to visualize the relationships.

Solution:
On Monday, Sarah sold 15 boxes of cookies and 10 boxes of brownies (15 - 5). On Tuesday, she sold 25 boxes of cookies (15 + 10) and 20 boxes of brownies. On Wednesday, she sold 50 boxes (15 + 10 + 25 + 20). The total earnings are: 
- Monday: (15 * ₺5) + (10 * ₺10) = ₺75 + ₺100 = ₺175
- Tuesday: (25 * ₺5) + (20 * ₺10) = ₺125 + ₺200 = ₺325
- Wednesday: (50 * ₺5) + (30 * ₺10) = ₺250 + ₺300 = ₺550
Total earnings = ₺175 + ₺325 + ₺550 = ₺1050
Average daily earning = ₺1050 / 3 = ₺350

     - Earnings from apricot pies: 21 * ₺21 = ₺441
     - Total earnings on Thursday: ₺342 + ₺441 = ₺783
   - **Friday:**
     - Earnings from muffins: 100 * ₺9 = ₺900
     - Earnings from apricot pies: 0 (since only muffins were sold)
     - Total earnings on Friday: ₺900

3. **Calculate the total earnings over the three days:**
   - Total earnings = ₺537 (Wednesday) + ₺783 (Thursday) + ₺900 (Friday) = ₺2220

4. **Calculate the average daily earning:**
   - Average daily earning = Total earnings / Number of days = ₺2220 / 3 = ₺740

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"In Mrs. Garcia's class of 120 students, 50% of the class are swimmers. Out of the remaining class, 45% of the students are choir members or part of dancers. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away tournament. Half of the swimmers are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the tournament?",66.0,"To find out how many students are leaving early to the tournament, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of swimmers:**
   - Total students in the class = 120
   - Percentage of swimmers = 50%
   - Number of swimmers = 50% of 120 = \( 0.5 \times 120 = 60 \)

2. **Calculate the number of non-swimmers:**
   - Number of non-swimmers = Total students - Number of swimmers
   - Number of non-swimmers = \( 120 - 60 = 60 \)

3. **Calculate the number of choir members or dancers:**
   - Percentage of non-swimmers who are choir members or dancers = 45%
   - Number of choir members or dancers = 45% of 60 = \( 0.45 \times 60 = 27 \)

4. **Calculate the number of swimmers who are leaving:**
   - Half of the swimmers are absent due to being sick.
   - Number of swimmers leaving = Half of 60 = \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \)

5. **Calculate the total number of students leaving:**
   - Total students leaving = Number of swimmers leaving + Number of choir members or dancers + Cheerleaders
   - Cheerleaders accompanying each group = 3
   - Total cheerleaders = 3 (for swimmers) + 3 (for choir members/dancers) = 6
   - Total students leaving = 30 (swimmers) + 27 (choir members/dancers) + 6 (cheerleaders) = \( 30 + 27 + 6 = 63 \)

Thus, the total number of students leaving early to the tournament is **63**.",63.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Total number of students in Mrs. Garcia's class**: 120 students.

2. **Percentage of students who are swimmers**: 50% of 120.
   - Calculation: 50% of 120 = 0.5 * 120 = 60 swimmers.

3. **Remaining students after accounting for swimmers**: 
   - Calculation: 120 - 60 = 60 students.

4. **Percentage of remaining students who are choir members or dancers**: 45% of 60.
   - Calculation: 45% of 60 = 0.45 * 60 = 27 students.

5. **Total number of students leaving early**: 
   - This includes swimmers, choir members, dancers, and cheerleaders.
   - First, we need to find out how many swimmers are leaving.
   - Half of the swimmers are absent due to being sick: 
     - Calculation: Half of 60 = 60 / 2 = 30 swimmers are leaving.

6. **Total students leaving early from the choir and dancers**: 27 students.

7. **Total number of cheerleaders accompanying the groups**: 
   - There are 3 cheerleaders for each of the 3 groups (swimmers, choir members, dancers).
   - Total cheerleaders: 3 * 3 = 9 cheerleaders.

8. **Total students leaving early to the tournament**:

p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Olga has a flower bed that is 132 meters long. Olga wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Olga's flowers grow 3meters wide so she needs to leave 12 meters between every plant (including the plants width). Olga already owns 7 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ₣9 at the store. However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",31.0,"To determine how much money Olga will spend to fill her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total width occupied by each plant including the space between them.**
   - Each plant is 3 meters wide.
   - The space between each plant is 12 meters.
   - Therefore, the total width occupied by each plant (including the space) is:
     \[
     3 \text{ meters (plant width)} + 12 \text{ meters (space)} = 15 \text{ meters}
     \]

2. **Determine how many plants can fit in the flower bed.**
   - The flower bed is 132 meters long.
   - To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the total width occupied by each plant:
     \[
     \text{Number of plants} = \frac{132 \text{ meters}}{15 \text{ meters/plant}} = 8.8
     \]
   - Since Olga cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means she can plant 8 plants.

3. **Calculate how many additional plants Olga needs to buy.**
   - Olga already owns 7 flowers.
   - Therefore, the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:
     \[
     8 \text{ (total plants needed)} - 7 \text{ (plants owned)} = 1 \text{ plant}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the additional plants.**
   - Each plant costs ₣9.
   - Since she is buying only 1 additional plant, the cost will be:
     \[
     1 \text{ plant} \times ₣9/\text{plant} = ₣9
     \]

5. **Determine if she qualifies for a discount.**
   - Olga is buying only 1 additional plant, which does not exceed the limit of 2 plants for the discount. Therefore, she does not qualify for the ₣5 discount.

6. **Calculate the total amount Olga will spend.**
   - Since she does not qualify for a discount, the total amount she will spend is simply the cost of the additional plant:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = ₣9
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Olga will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is **₣9**.",9.0,0,"Let's think step by step.

1. **Determine the total width occupied by each plant**: Each flower grows 3 meters wide, and Olga needs to leave 12 meters between every plant. Therefore, the total space occupied by each plant (including the space between them) is:
   \[
   3 \text{ meters (width of the plant)} + 12 \text{ meters (space)} = 15 \text{ meters}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many plants can fit in the flower bed**: The flower bed is 132 meters long. To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space occupied by each plant:
   \[
   \frac{132 \text{ meters}}{15 \text{ meters per plant}} = 8.8
   \]
   Since Olga cannot plant a fraction of a plant, she can fit 8 plants in the flower bed.

3. **Determine how many more plants Olga needs to buy**: Olga already owns 7 flowers. Therefore, the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:
   \[
   8 \text{ (total plants needed)} - 7 \text{ (plants she already has)} = 1 \text{ plant}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the additional plants**: Each flowering plant costs ₣9. Since Olga needs to buy 1 plant, the total cost will be:
   \[
   1 \text{ plant} \times ₣9 = ₣9

[Example Input]
Question: Sarah has a garden that is 100 meters long. She wants to plant trees that are 4 meters wide and needs to leave 10 meters between each tree (including the tree's width). Sarah already has 5 trees. Each tree costs ₣12, but if she buys more than 3 trees, she will receive a ₣6 discount on her total purchase. How much will Sarah spend at the store to fill her garden?

Wrong answer: I calculated that Sarah can fit 20 trees in her garden, so I multiplied 20 by ₣12, which gives ₣240. I forgot to account for the discount and the trees she already has.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of trees that can fit in the garden by not considering the space needed between them correctly. I also neglected to apply the discount for purchasing more than 3 trees.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Ignoring spacing
- Discount application error

Instructions:
1. Determine the total length available for planting by subtracting the space taken by existing trees.
2. Calculate the total width occupied by each tree and the space between them.
3. Use the total length to find out how many trees can fit.
4. Subtract the number of existing trees from the total number of trees that can fit to find out how many more trees need to be purchased.
5. Calculate the total cost based on the number of trees to be purchased and apply any applicable discounts.

Advice:
- Always double-check the spacing requirements when calculating how many items can fit in a given area.
- Keep track of any existing items that may affect your calculations.
- Be mindful of discount conditions and ensure they are applied correctly in your final calculations.

Solution:
1. The total length available for planting is 100 meters.
2. Each tree occupies 4 meters, and with 10 meters between them, each tree effectively takes up 14 meters (4 + 10).
3. The number of trees that can fit is 100 / 14 = 7.14, so 7 trees can fit.
4. Sarah already has 5 trees, so she needs to buy 2 more.
5. The cost for 2 trees is 2 * ₣12 = ₣24. Since she is buying more than 3 trees in total, she gets a ₣6 discount.
6. Therefore, the total cost is ₣24 - ₣6 = ₣18.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Olga has a flower bed that is 132 meters long. Olga wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Olga's flowers grow 3meters wide so she needs to leave 12 meters between every plant (including the plants width). Olga already owns 7 flowers. Each flowering plant costs ₣9 at the store. However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a ₣5 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 9.0
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not properly calculate the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed. I failed to account for the total space each plant occupies, including the required spacing between them. Additionally, I neglected to consider the number of existing plants Olga already has, which affects how many more she needs to buy.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Ignoring spacing
- Existing items not accounted for
- Discount application error

### Solution:
1. **Determine the total length available for planting**: The flower bed is 132 meters long.
2. **Calculate the total width occupied by each plant and the space between them**: Each plant is 3 meters wide, and with 12 meters between each plant, the total space each plant occupies is:
   \[
   3 \text{ meters (plant width)} + 12 \text{ meters (spacing)} = 15 \text{ meters}
   \]
3. **Calculate how many plants can fit in the flower bed**: 
   \[
   \text{Number of plants} = \frac{132 \text{ meters}}{15 \text{ meters}} = 8.8
   \]
   Since we can only have whole plants, Olga can fit 8 plants in the flower bed.
4. **Subtract the number of existing plants**: Olga already has 7 plants, so she needs to buy:
   \[
   8 \text{ (total plants)} - 7 \text{ (existing plants)} = 1 \text{ plant}
   \]
5. **Calculate the total cost for the new plants**: The cost for 1 plant is:
   \[
   1 \text{ plant} \times ₣9 = ₣9
   \]
   Since she is buying only 1 plant, she does not qualify for the discount (which applies only if more than 2 plants are purchased).
6. **Final cost**: Therefore, the total cost for Olga to fill her flower bed is:
   \[
   ₣9
   \]

### Detailed Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify all relevant measurements and conditions.
2. Calculate the total space each plant occupies, including the width of the plant and the required spacing.
3. Divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space occupied by each plant to find out how many plants can fit.
4. Subtract the number of existing plants from the total number of plants that can fit to determine how many more need to be purchased.
5. Calculate the cost of the new plants based on the number needed and the price per plant.
6. Check if any discounts apply based on the number of plants being purchased.
7. Calculate the final total cost, applying any discounts if applicable.

### General Advice:
- Always ensure to account for both the dimensions of the items and the required spacing when calculating how many can fit in a given area.
- Keep track of any existing items that may affect your calculations, as they can significantly change the outcome.
- Be vigilant about discount conditions and ensure they are applied correctly based on the total number of items being purchased.","--- Beginning of the template ---

Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of trees that could fit in the garden by not considering the space needed between them correctly. I also neglected to apply the discount for purchasing more than 3 trees.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Discount omission
- Incorrect spacing

Instructions:
1. Determine the total length available for planting by subtracting the width of the existing trees from the total length of the garden.
2. Calculate the total space each tree occupies (tree width + space between trees).
3. Divide the available length by the total space per tree to find out how many trees can fit.
4. Subtract the number of trees already owned from the total number of trees that can fit to find out how many more trees need to be purchased.
5. Calculate the total cost of the new trees and apply any applicable discounts based on the number of trees purchased.

Advice:
- Always double-check the spacing requirements when calculating how many items can fit in a given space.
- Keep track of any existing items that may affect your calculations.
- Be mindful of discount thresholds and ensure they are applied correctly to the total cost.

Solution:
1. The total space each tree occupies is 4 meters (width) + 10 meters (space) = 14 meters.
2. The number of trees that can fit in 100 meters is 100 / 14 = approximately 7 trees.
3. Sarah already has 5 trees, so she needs to buy 7 - 5 = 2 more trees.
4. The cost for 2 trees is 2 * ₣12 = ₣24. Since she is buying more than 3 trees in total (5 existing + 2 new), she qualifies for the ₣6 discount.

I answered the question incorrectly because I did not properly calculate the number of plants that could fit in the flower bed. I failed to account for the total space each plant occupies, which includes both the width of the plant and the space needed between them. Additionally, I neglected to consider the number of plants Olga already owns and the discount applicable for purchasing more than 2 plants.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Spacing oversight
- Discount omission
- Incorrect total cost calculation

### Solution:
1. **Calculate the total space each plant occupies**: 
   - Each plant is 3 meters wide, and there is a 12-meter space between each plant.
   - Total space per plant = 3 meters (width) + 12 meters (space) = 15 meters.

2. **Determine how many plants can fit in the flower bed**:
   - Total length of the flower bed = 132 meters.
   - Number of plants that can fit = 132 meters / 15 meters per plant = 8.8, which means a maximum of 8 plants can fit (since we can't have a fraction of a plant).

3. **Calculate how many more plants Olga needs to buy**:
   - Olga already owns 7 plants.
   - Additional plants needed = 8 (total plants that can fit) - 7 (plants already owned) = 1 plant.

4. **Calculate the total cost of the new plants**:
   - Cost for 1 new plant = 1 * ₣9 = ₣9.
   - Since she is buying only 1 new plant, she does not qualify for the ₣5 discount (the discount applies only if more than 2 plants are purchased).

5. **Final total cost**:
   - Total cost = ₣9 (no discount applied).

### Detailed Instructions:
1. Identify the total length of the area available for planting.
2. Determine the width of each plant and the required space between them.
3. Calculate the total space each plant occupies (width + space).
4. Divide the total length of the area by the total space per plant to find out how many plants can fit.
5. Subtract the number of plants already owned from the total number of plants that can fit to find out how many more need to be purchased.
6. Calculate the cost of the new plants and check if any discounts apply based on the number of plants purchased.

### General Advice:
- Always ensure to account for both the dimensions of the items and the required spacing when calculating how many can fit in a given area.
- Keep track of any existing items that may affect your calculations.
- Be aware of discount thresholds and ensure they are applied correctly to the total cost based on the number of items purchased.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not properly calculate the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed. I also failed to consider the existing flowers Olga already owns and did not apply the discount correctly. My previous answer of 9.0 was not based on any calculations relevant to the problem.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Discount application error
- Ignoring existing items
- Incorrect total cost calculation

### Solution:
1. **Determine the total space each plant occupies**: Each plant is 3 meters wide, and there is a 12-meter gap between each plant. Therefore, the total space each plant occupies is:
   \[
   3 \text{ meters (width)} + 12 \text{ meters (space)} = 15 \text{ meters}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many plants can fit in the flower bed**: The flower bed is 132 meters long. To find out how many plants can fit, divide the total length by the space each plant occupies:
   \[
   132 \text{ meters} \div 15 \text{ meters} \approx 8.8
   \]
   Since we cannot have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 8 plants.

3. **Subtract the number of flowers Olga already owns**: Olga already has 7 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she can buy is:
   \[
   8 \text{ (total plants)} - 7 \text{ (existing plants)} = 1 \text{ additional plant}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost based on the number of plants to be purchased**: Each flowering plant costs ₣9, so for 1 additional plant:
   \[
   1 \text{ plant} \times ₣9 = ₣9
   \]

5. **Check if the number of plants purchased qualifies for a discount**: Since Olga is buying only 1 plant, she does not qualify for the discount (which applies only if more than 2 plants are purchased). Therefore, the total cost remains:
   \[
   ₣9
   \]

### Final Answer:
Olga will spend **₣9** at the store to fill up her flower bed.

### Instructions for Future Problems:
1. Carefully read the problem to understand the dimensions and spacing requirements.
2. Calculate the total space each item occupies, including any necessary gaps.
3. Determine how many items can fit within the given space by dividing the total length by the space each item occupies.
4. Subtract any existing items from the total number of items that can fit to find out how many more can be purchased.
5. Calculate the total cost based on the number of items to be purchased.
6. Check if the purchase qualifies for any discounts and apply them correctly.

### General Advice for Similar Problems:
- Always double-check calculations for dimensions and spacing.
- Keep track of existing items to avoid overestimating the number of new items needed.
- Be mindful of discount conditions and ensure they are applied correctly based on the number of items purchased.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid confusion and ensure all aspects are considered.","--- Beginning of the adapted template ---

- Always double-check the calculations for space and dimensions.
- Keep track of existing items to avoid overestimating purchases.
- Be mindful of discount conditions and apply them correctly.

Solution:
1. Each tree occupies 4 meters (width) + 10 meters (space) = 14 meters.
2. 100 meters / 14 meters = approximately 7 trees can fit.
3. Sarah already has 5 trees, so she can buy 7 - 5 = 2 more trees.
4. Total cost for 2 trees = 2 * ₣12 = ₣24.
5. Since she is buying 2 trees, she does not qualify for a discount, so the total cost remains ₣24.

How many minutes will it take her to peel and saute 150 clams if it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam before peeling it? Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a 13-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.,163.0,"To determine how long it will take Olga to peel and sauté 150 clams, we need to break down the tasks into their respective times and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the time to wash the clams
Olga needs to wash each clam before peeling it, and it takes 12 seconds to wash each clam. 

For 150 clams:
\[
\text{Time to wash} = 150 \text{ clams} \times 12 \text{ seconds/clam} = 1800 \text{ seconds}
\]

Convert seconds to minutes:
\[
1800 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time to peel the clams
Olga can peel 6 clams per minute. 

For 150 clams:
\[
\text{Time to peel} = \frac{150 \text{ clams}}{6 \text{ clams/minute}} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the break time
After peeling, Olga takes a 13-minute break.

### Step 4: Calculate the time to sauté the clams
Olga can sauté 30 clams in 19 minutes. 

To find out how long it takes to sauté 150 clams, we first determine how many batches of 30 clams are in 150 clams:
\[
\text{Number of batches} = \frac{150 \text{ clams}}{30 \text{ clams/batch}} = 5 \text{ batches}
\]

Now, calculate the total time to sauté 150 clams:
\[
\text{Time to sauté} = 5 \text{ batches} \times 19 \text{ minutes/batch} = 95 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 5: Total time calculation
Now, we sum all the times:
- Time to wash: 30 minutes
- Time to peel: 25 minutes
- Break time: 13 minutes
- Time to sauté: 95 minutes

Total time:
\[
\text{Total time} = 30 + 25 + 13 + 95 = 163 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it will take Olga a total of **163 minutes** to wash, peel, take a break, and sauté 150 clams.",150.0,0,"A: Let's think step by step.

He is going to sell each box for $8. How much is Andre going to make?",408.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Pineapples picked on each day:**
   - Saturday: 177 pineapples
   - Sunday: 183 pineapples
   - Monday: Double the amount picked on Saturday:
     \[
     \text{Monday's pineapples} = 2 \times 177 = 354 \text{ pineapples}
     \]

2. **Total pineapples picked from Saturday to Monday:**
   \[
   \text{Total for Saturday, Sunday, and Monday} = 177 + 183 + 354

   Let's calculate that:
   \[
   177 + 183 = 360
   \]
   \[
   360 + 354 = 714
   \]
   So, Andre picked a total of 714 pineapples from Saturday to Monday.

3. **Pineapples picked on Tuesday:**
   - Tuesday: Half of the total picked in the past 3 days:
   \[
   \text{Tuesday's pineapples} = \frac{714}{2} = 357 \text{ pineapples}
   \]

4. **Total pineapples picked from Saturday to Tuesday:**
   \[
   \text{Total for Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday} = 177 + 183 + 354 + 357

   - So, on Monday, he picks 2 * 177 = 354 pineapples.
4. Now, let's calculate the total number of pineapples picked over the three days:
   - Total = 177 (Saturday) + 183 (Sunday) + 354 (Monday) = 714 pineapples.
5. On Tuesday, he picks half the amount of what he picked in the past 3 days combined:
   - So, on Tuesday, he picks 714 / 2 = 357 pineapples.
6. Now, let's calculate the total number of pineapples Andre has after Tuesday:
   - Total pineapples = 714 (from the first three days) + 357 (Tuesday) = 1071 pineapples.
7. On Wednesday, Andre is going to sell pineapples in boxes of 21 pineapples each:
   - The number of boxes he can sell = 1071 / 21 = 51 boxes (since 1071 divided by 21 equals 51 with no remainder).

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by 60% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 50% for the second half. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?",1755.0,"To find out how many pizzas the family eats in two months, we will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the daily pizza consumption of each family member.

- Uncle: 10 pizzas/day
- Spouse: 20 pizzas/day

**Combined consumption of uncle and spouse:**
\[
10 + 20 = 30 \text{ pizzas/day}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the grandchild's pizza consumption.

The grandchild eats two-fourths (which is equivalent to one-half) of the combined number of pizzas eaten by the uncle and spouse.

**Grandchild's consumption:**
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ pizzas/day}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total daily consumption for the family.

**Total daily consumption:**
\[
10 + 20 + 15 = 45 \text{ pizzas/day}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total consumption for the first month.

Assuming one month has 30 days, the total consumption for the first month is:
\[
45 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 1350 \text{ pizzas}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the consumption for the second month.

#### First half of the month (15 days) - 60% reduction.

**Reduced consumption:**
\[
45 \text{ pizzas/day} \times (1 - 0.60) = 45 \times 0.40 = 18 \text{ pizzas/day}
\]

**Total for the first half of the second month:**
\[
18 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 270 \text{ pizzas}
\]

#### Second half of the month (15 days) - additional 50% reduction.

**Further reduced consumption:**
\[
18 \text{ pizzas/day} \times (1 - 0.50) = 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \text{ pizzas/day}
\]

**Total for the second half of the second month:**
\[
9 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ pizzas}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total consumption for the second month.

**Total for the second month:**
\[
270 \text{ pizzas} + 135 \text{ pizzas} = 405 \text{ pizzas}
\]

### Step 7: Calculate the total consumption for both months.

**Total for both months:**
\[
1350 \text{ pizzas} + 405 \text{ pizzas} = 1755 \text{ pizzas}

   - The grandchild eats two-fourths (which is the same as one-half) of the combined number of pizzas:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ pizzas}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total daily pizza consumption for the family is:
     \[
     30 + 15 = 45 \text{ pizzas}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total pizza consumption for the first month:**
   - There are 30 days in a month.
   - The total pizzas eaten in the first month is:
     \[
     45 \text{ pizzas/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 1350 \text{ pizzas}
     \]

3. **Calculate the pizza consumption for the second month:**
   - For the first half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by 60%:
     - The reduced consumption is:
     \[
     45 \text{ pizzas} \times (1 - 0.60) = 45 \times 0.40 = 18 \text{ pizzas/day}

2. **Seats reserved for graduates**: 700 seats
3. **Seats reserved for faculty**: 450 seats
4. **Seats reserved for staff**: 50 seats

Now, we can calculate the total number of seats that are reserved:

\[
\text{Total reserved seats} = \text{Seats for graduates} + \text{Seats for faculty} + \text{Seats for staff}

Now, we need to determine how many graduates there are. Since there are 700 seats reserved for graduates, we can assume there are 700 graduates.

To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we divide the available seats for guests by the number of graduates:

\[
\text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{\text{Available seats for guests}}{\text{Number of graduates}}

4. Mohammed can respond to 2 less than half of the emails that require a response. First, we find half of 24:
   \[
   \frac{24}{2} = 12
   \]
5. Now, we subtract 2 from this amount:
   \[
   12 - 2 = 10 \text{ emails he can respond to each day}
   \]
6. In a 6-day work week, without overtime, the total number of emails he responds to is:
   \[
   10 \text{ emails/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ emails}
   \]
7. On the last day, he works overtime and can respond to 10% more emails than usual. First, we calculate 10% of 10:
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } 10 = 0.10 \times 10 = 1 \text{ email}
   \]
8. So, on the last day, he responds to:
   \[
   10 + 1 = 11 \text{ emails}
   \]
9. Now, we need to adjust the total for the 6-day work week to include the extra email on the last day:
   - For the first 5 days, he responds to 10 emails each day:
   \[
   10 \text{ emails/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ emails}
   \]
   - Adding the 11 emails from the last day:
   \[
   50 + 11 = 61 \text{ emails}
   \]

The answer is 61.",61.0,1,0,1,61.0,,,
p2,gsm-symbolic,openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Ananya walks 24 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 miles of walking on the beach and 14 miles of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?",85.0,"To solve the problem, we need to determine Ananya's walking speeds and the time she spends on each segment of her walk.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( r \) be Ananya's original speed on the beach (in miles per minute).
   - Then her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2r \) (since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk).

2. **Injury Impact:**
   - After her injury, her speed on the beach becomes \( \frac{r}{2} \).
   - Her speed on the sidewalk becomes \( \frac{2r}{2} = r \).

3. **Time Spent on the Beach:**
   - We know that Ananya spends 50 minutes walking on the beach.
   - The distance she walks on the beach is 10 miles.
   - Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \), we can express this as:
     \[
     50 = \frac{10}{\frac{r}{2}}
     \]
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     50 = \frac{10 \cdot 2}{r} \implies 50 = \frac{20}{r} \implies r = \frac{20}{50} = \frac{2}{5} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

4. **Calculate Speeds After Injury:**
   - Speed on the beach after injury: 
     \[
     \frac{r}{2} = \frac{2/5}{2} = \frac{1}{5} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]
   - Speed on the sidewalk after injury:
     \[
     r = \frac{2}{5} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

5. **Time Spent on the Sidewalk:**
   - The distance Ananya walks on the sidewalk is 14 miles.
   - Using the speed on the sidewalk after injury, we can find the time spent on the sidewalk:
     \[
     \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{14}{\frac{2}{5}} = 14 \cdot \frac{5}{2} = 35 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Total Time for the Walk:**
   - The total time for the entire 24-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 50 + 35 = 85 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Ananya to complete the entire 24-mile walk is \( \boxed{85} \) minutes.",85.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Ananya walks a total of 24 miles every day, which includes 10 miles on the beach and 14 miles on the sidewalk.

2. We know that Ananya spends 50 minutes walking on the beach. 

3. Let's determine her speed on the beach. Since she walks 10 miles in 50 minutes, we can calculate her speed on the beach:
   - Speed on the beach = Distance / Time = 10 miles / (50 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) = 10 miles / (5/6 hours) = 10 * (6/5) = 12 miles per hour.

4. On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at twice the speed of her beach speed. Therefore, her original speed on the sidewalk would be:
   - Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * Speed on the beach = 2 * 12 miles per hour = 24 miles per hour.

5. However, due to her injury, her speed has decreased by half. So, her current speeds are:
   - Speed on the beach after injury = 12 miles per hour / 2 = 6 miles per hour.
   - Speed on the sidewalk after injury = 24 miles per hour / 2 = 12 miles per hour.

6. Now, let's calculate the time it takes for her to walk the remaining 14 miles on the sidewalk:
   - Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 14 miles / 12 miles per hour = 14 / 12 hours = 7/6 hours.

7. To convert this time into minutes:
   - Time on the sidewalk in minutes = (7/6 hours) * 60 minutes/hour = 70 minutes.

8. Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the entire 24-mile walk:
   - Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk = 50 minutes + 70 minutes = 120 minutes.

[Example Input]
Question: Sarah jogs 30 miles every week, which includes 12 miles on a trail and 18 miles on the road. On the road, Sarah jogs at three times the speed she does on the trail. After an injury, her speed has decreased to two-thirds of her original speed on both the trail and the road. If she spends 40 minutes jogging on the trail, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 30-mile jog, in minutes?
Wrong answer: I calculated that Sarah took 60 minutes to jog the entire distance by assuming her speed on the trail was the same as on the road and not accounting for her decreased speed after the injury.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the time it took Sarah to jog the entire distance by not properly adjusting her speeds after the injury and incorrectly assuming the same speed for both terrains.

Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding of speed adjustment
- Incorrect time calculation
- Failure to differentiate between terrains

Instructions:
1. Identify the total distance and the distances for each terrain.
2. Determine the speed for each terrain before and after the injury.
3. Calculate the time spent on each terrain using the formula: time = distance/speed.
4. Add the times for both terrains to find the total time.
5. Ensure all units are consistent (convert hours to minutes if necessary).

Advice:
- Always double-check how changes in conditions (like speed) affect calculations.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion.
- Use clear labels for each variable to keep track of different speeds and distances.

Solution:
1. Let the original speed on the beach be \( x \) mph. Then, the speed on the sidewalk is \( 2x \) mph.
2. After the injury, the speed on the beach is \( \frac{x}{2} \) mph and on the sidewalk is \( x \) mph.
3. Time spent on the beach: \( 50 \) minutes = \( \frac{50}{60} \) hours = \( \frac{5}{6} \) hours.
4. Distance on the beach = \( 10 \) miles, so speed on the beach = \( \frac{10}{\frac{5}{6}} = 12 \) mph, thus \( x = 12 \) mph.
5. Speed on the sidewalk = \( 2x = 24 \) mph, so after injury, speed on sidewalk = \( 12 \) mph.
6. Time on sidewalk = \( \frac{14}{12} \) hours = \( \frac{7}{6} \) hours = \( 70 \) minutes.
7. Total time = \( 50 + 70 = 120 \) minutes.

The correct answer is 120 minutes.

You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I miscalculated the total time it took Ananya to complete her walk by not properly adjusting her speeds after the injury and incorrectly assuming the same speed for both terrains. I also failed to account for the time spent on the sidewalk correctly.

### Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding of speed adjustment
- Incorrect time calculation
- Failure to differentiate between terrains

### Solution:
1. **Identify the distances and speeds:**
   - Distance on the beach = 10 miles
   - Distance on the sidewalk = 14 miles
   - Total distance = 24 miles
   - Let the original speed on the beach be \( x \) mph. Then, the speed on the sidewalk is \( 2x \) mph.

2. **Adjust for the injury:**
   - After the injury, the speed on the beach = \( \frac{x}{2} \) mph
   - Speed on the sidewalk = \( \frac{2x}{2} = x \) mph

3. **Calculate the time spent on the beach:**
   - Time spent on the beach = 50 minutes = \( \frac{50}{60} \) hours = \( \frac{5}{6} \) hours
   - Distance on the beach = 10 miles
   - Speed on the beach = \( \frac{10 \text{ miles}}{\frac{5}{6} \text{ hours}} = 12 \) mph
   - Therefore, \( x = 12 \) mph (original speed on the beach).

4. **Calculate the speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Speed on the sidewalk = \( 2x = 24 \) mph
   - After the injury, speed on the sidewalk = \( x = 12 \) mph.

5. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Distance on the sidewalk = 14 miles
   - Time on the sidewalk = \( \frac{14 \text{ miles}}{12 \text{ mph}} = \frac{14}{12} \) hours = \( \frac{7}{6} \) hours.
   - Convert to minutes: \( \frac{7}{6} \times 60 = 70 \) minutes.

6. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk
   - Total time = 50 minutes + 70 minutes = 120 minutes.

### Correct Answer:
The correct answer is **120 minutes**.

### Instructions for Future Problems:
1. Identify the total distance and the distances for each terrain.
2. Determine the original speed for each terrain.

Question: Sarah rides her bike for 30 miles, which includes 12 miles on a dirt path and 18 miles on a paved road. On the paved road, Sarah rides at three times the speed she does on the dirt path. After a recent bike repair, her speed has decreased by one-third on both surfaces. If she spends 20 minutes riding on the dirt path, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 30-mile ride, in minutes?
Wrong answer: I calculated that Sarah took 40 minutes to complete the ride by assuming her speed on the dirt path was the same as on the paved road, which was incorrect.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the time spent on the paved road by not properly accounting for the change in speed after the repair and incorrectly assumed the speeds were equal.

Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding speed relationships
- Incorrect time calculation
- Ignoring speed reduction

Instructions:
1. Identify the total distance and the distances covered on different surfaces.
2. Determine the speed on each surface based on the given relationships.
3. Adjust the speeds according to any changes mentioned in the problem.
4. Calculate the time spent on each surface using the formula: time = distance/speed.
5. Sum the time spent on each surface to find the total time.

Advice:
- Always clarify the relationships between speeds on different surfaces.
- Pay attention to any changes in speed due to external factors.
- Double-check calculations for time based on the adjusted speeds.

Solution:
To solve the problem, first, let the speed on the dirt path be \( x \). Then, the speed on the paved road is \( 3x \). After the repair, the speeds become \( \frac{x}{3} \) and \( x \). The time spent on the dirt path is 20 minutes, which is \( \frac{12}{\frac{x}{3}} = \frac{36}{x} \) minutes. The time on the paved road is \( \frac{18}{x} \) minutes. The total time is \( 20 + \frac{18}{x} \). Solving for \( x \) gives the total time for the ride.

I answered the question incorrectly because I did not properly account for the change in speed due to Ananya's injury. I mistakenly calculated the time spent on the sidewalk without adjusting the speed correctly, leading to an incorrect total time for the entire walk.

### Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding speed relationships
- Incorrect time calculation
- Ignoring speed reduction

### Solution:
1. **Identify the speeds**: Let the speed on the beach be \( x \). Then, the speed on the sidewalk is \( 2x \).
2. **Adjust for injury**: After the injury, the speed on the beach becomes \( \frac{x}{2} \) and the speed on the sidewalk becomes \( x \).
3. **Calculate time on the beach**: Ananya spends 50 minutes walking on the beach, which covers 10 miles. The time formula is:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \implies 50 = \frac{10}{\frac{x}{2}} \implies 50 = \frac{20}{x} \implies x = \frac{20}{50} = \frac{2}{5} \text{ miles per minute}
   \]
4. **Calculate the speed on the sidewalk**: The speed on the sidewalk is \( 2x = 2 \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{4}{5} \) miles per minute.
5. **Calculate time on the sidewalk**: The distance on the sidewalk is 14 miles. The time spent walking on the sidewalk is:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{14}{\frac{4}{5}} = 14 \times \frac{5}{4} = 17.5 \text{ minutes}
   \]
6. **Total time**: The total time for the entire walk is:
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \text{Time on Beach} + \text{Time on Sidewalk} = 50 + 17.5 = 67.5 \text{ minutes}

If 60 minutes of her jog is spent on the trail, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 30-mile jog, in minutes?
Wrong answer: I calculated that Sarah took 90 minutes to complete her jog by assuming her speed on the trail was 6 miles per hour and not adjusting for her decreased speed on the track.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the time it took Sarah to jog on the track by not considering her reduced speed due to her cold. I also failed to correctly calculate the total time based on the distances and speeds.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Speed adjustment
- Time calculation

Instructions:
1. Identify the total distance and the distances covered on different terrains.
2. Determine the original speeds for each terrain.
3. Adjust the speeds based on any given conditions (like injuries or illnesses).
4. Calculate the time spent on each terrain using the formula: time = distance/speed.
5. Sum the times spent on each terrain to find the total time.

Advice:
- Always double-check if any conditions affect the speeds before calculating time.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts to avoid confusion.
- Use clear formulas for distance, speed, and time to ensure accuracy.

Solution:
To find the time Sarah takes to jog on the trail, I first calculate her adjusted speed on the trail. If her original speed was 6 mph, her new speed is 4 mph (6 - 2 mph due to the cold). The time spent on the trail is 12 miles / 4 mph = 3 hours (180 minutes). For the track, her original speed was 18 mph, and her new speed is 12 mph (18 - 6 mph). The time spent on the track is 18 miles / 12 mph = 1.5 hours (90 minutes). Therefore, the total time is 180 minutes + 90 minutes = 270 minutes.

Now, look at this question:
Question: Ananya walks 24 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 miles of walking on the beach and 14 miles of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?
Your initial Chain-of-Thought answer was: 120.0

Your previous reflection answers were:
Reflection 1: 120.0
Reflection 2: 67.5
You previously answered this question incorrectly. Reflect on why your answer was incorrect and identify the type of error. Then, solve the problem again step-by-step with corrections. Your new answer MUST be different from your previous answers cause they were all incorrect.","### Explanation:
I initially answered the question incorrectly by miscalculating the time Ananya took to walk on the sidewalk. I did not properly adjust her speed due to her injury and failed to calculate the time for both the beach and sidewalk segments accurately. I also did not consider the total distance correctly based on the adjusted speeds.

### Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Speed adjustment
- Time calculation
- Incorrect assumptions

### Solution:
1. **Identify the total distance and distances on different terrains:**
   - Total distance = 24 miles
   - Beach distance = 10 miles
   - Sidewalk distance = 14 miles

2. **Determine the original speeds for each terrain:**
   - Let Ananya's original speed on the beach be \( x \) mph.
   - Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2x \) mph.

3. **Adjust the speeds based on the injury:**
   - Due to her injury, her speed on the beach becomes \( \frac{x}{2} \) mph.
   - Her speed on the sidewalk becomes \( \frac{2x}{2} = x \) mph.

4. **Calculate the time spent on each terrain:**
   - Time spent on the beach:
     \[
     \text{Time}_{\text{beach}} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10 \text{ miles}}{\frac{x}{2} \text{ mph}} = \frac{20}{x} \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time spent on the sidewalk:
     \[
     \text{Time}_{\text{sidewalk}} = \frac{14 \text{ miles}}{x \text{ mph}} = \frac{14}{x} \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Convert the time spent on the beach from minutes to hours:**
   - 50 minutes = \( \frac{50}{60} \) hours = \( \frac{5}{6} \) hours.

6. **Set up the equation for total time:**
   - The total time for the walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk:
     \[
     \frac{5}{6} + \frac{20}{x} + \frac{14}{x} = \text{Total time}
     \]
   - Combine the terms:
     \[
     \frac{5}{6} + \frac{34}{x} = \text{Total time}
     \]

7. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - The total distance is 24 miles, which can be expressed in terms of speed and time:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Total time}
     \]
   - The total speed is \( \frac{x}{2} \) for the beach and \( 2x \) for the sidewalk, but we need to find \( x \) first.

8. **Using the time spent on the beach to find \( x \):**
   - From the time spent on the beach:
     \[
     \frac{10}{\frac{x}{2}} = 50 \text{ minutes} \implies 10 = \frac{50x}{60} \implies 10 = \frac{5x}{6} \implies x = 12 \text{ mph}
     \]

9. **Calculate adjusted speeds:**
   - Beach speed = \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) mph
   - Sidewalk speed = \( 12 \) mph

10. **Calculate time spent on each segment:**
    - Time on the beach:
      \[
      \text{Time}_{\text{beach}} = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \text{ hours} = 100 \text{ minutes}
      \]
    - Time on the sidewalk:
      \[
      \text{Time}_{\text{sidewalk}} = \frac{14}{12} = \frac{7}{6} \text{ hours} = 70 \text{ minutes}
      \]

11. **Total time:**
    - Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
      \[
      \text{Total time} = 100 + 70 = 170 \text{ minutes}
      \]

### Final Answer:
Ananya takes **170 minutes** to complete her entire 24-mile walk.

### Instructions for Future Problems:
1. Identify the total distance and the distances covered on different terrains.
2. Determine the original speeds for each terrain.
3. Adjust the speeds based on any given conditions (like injuries or illnesses).
4. Calculate the time spent on each terrain using the formula: time = distance/speed.
5. Convert any time units as necessary (e.g., minutes to hours).
6. Sum the times spent on each terrain to find the total time.

### General Advice:

Question: Sarah jogs 30 miles every week, which includes 12 miles on a trail and 18 miles on a track. On the track, Sarah jogs at three times the speed she does on the trail. However, due to a recent cold, her speed has decreased by one-third both on the trail and track. If 60 minutes of her jog is spent on the trail, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 30-mile jog, in minutes?
Wrong answer: I calculated that Sarah took 90 minutes to complete her jog by assuming her speed on the trail was 6 miles per hour and not adjusting for her decreased speed on the track.

Solution:
To find the time Sarah takes to jog on the trail, I first calculate her adjusted speed on the trail. If her original speed was 6 mph, her new speed is 4 mph (6 - 2 mph due to the cold). The time spent on the trail is 12 miles / 4 mph = 3 hours (180 minutes). For the track, her original speed was 18 mph, and her new speed is 12 mph (18 - 6 mph). The time spent on the track is 18 miles / 12 mph = 1.5 hours (90 minutes). Therefore, the total time is 180 minutes + 90 minutes = 270 minutes.

Elena finds 5 cookies. Mei finds twice as many as Elena. Xavier finds 2 less than Mei. Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier, and Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined. How many cookies are still hidden in the yard?",64.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of cookies**: Amelia had 11 dozen cookies.
   \[
   11 \text{ dozen} = 11 \times 12 = 132 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. **Cookies eaten by Amelia**: She ate 5 cookies for breakfast.
   \[
   132 - 5 = 127 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. **Cookies hidden in the yard**: After eating, Amelia hid 127 cookies in the yard.

4. **Cookies found by Elena**: Elena finds 5 cookies.
   \[
   \text{Elena's cookies} = 5
   \]

5. **Cookies found by Mei**: Mei finds twice as many as Elena.
   \[
   \text{Mei's cookies} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

6. **Cookies found by Xavier**: Xavier finds 2 less than Mei.
   \[
   \text{Xavier's cookies} = 10 - 2 = 8
   \]

7. **Cookies found by Mohammed**: Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier.
   \[
   \text{Mohammed's cookies} = \frac{8}{8} = 1
   \]

8. **Cookies found by Umar**: Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined.
   - First, calculate the total cookies found by Mei and Elena:
   \[
   \text{Mei's cookies} + \text{Elena's cookies} = 10 + 5 = 15
   \]
   - Now, calculate Umar's cookies:
   \[
   \text{Umar's cookies} = 15 + 2 \times 12 = 15 + 24 = 39
   \]

9. **Total cookies found**: Now, we sum up all the cookies found by each person:
   \[
   \text{Total found} = \text{Elena's cookies} + \text{Mei's cookies} + \text{Xavier's cookies} + \text{Mohammed's cookies} + \text{Umar's cookies}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total found} = 5 + 10 + 8 + 1 + 39 = 63
   \]

10. **Cookies still hidden in the yard**: Finally, we subtract the total cookies found from the total cookies hidden.
   \[
   \text{Cookies still hidden} = 127 - 63 = 64
   \]

Thus, the number of cookies still hidden in the yard is \(\boxed{64}\).",64.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. Amelia initially had 11 dozen cookies. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we calculate the total number of cookies:
   \[
   11 \text{ dozen} = 11 \times 12 = 132 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. Amelia ate 5 cookies for breakfast. We subtract the cookies she ate from the total:
   \[
   132 - 5 = 127 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. Now, 127 cookies are hidden in the yard.

4. Elena finds 5 cookies. We subtract this from the total hidden cookies:
   \[
   127 - 5 = 122 \text{ cookies left}
   \]

5. Mei finds twice as many cookies as Elena. Since Elena found 5 cookies:
   \[
   Mei = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cookies}
   \]

6. Now we subtract Mei's cookies from the total:
   \[
   122 - 10 = 112 \text{ cookies left}
   \]

7. Xavier finds 2 less than Mei. Since Mei found 10 cookies:
   \[
   Xavier = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ cookies}
   \]

8. We subtract Xavier's cookies from the total:
   \[
   112 - 8 = 104 \text{ cookies left}
   \]

9. Mohammed finds an eighth as many as Xavier. Since Xavier found 8 cookies:
   \[
   Mohammed = \frac{8}{8} = 1 \text{ cookie}
   \]

10. We subtract Mohammed's cookies from the total:
    \[
    104 - 1 = 103 \text{ cookies left}
    \]

11. Umar finds two dozen cookies more than Mei and Elena combined. First, we calculate how many cookies Mei and Elena found together:
    \[
    \text{Mei} + \text{Elena} = 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ cookies}
    \]
    Then, two dozen is:
    \[
    2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ cookies}
    \]
    So, Umar finds:
    \[
    Umar = 15 + 24 = 39 \text{ cookies}
    \]

12. Finally, we subtract Umar's cookies from the total:
    \[
    103 - 39 = 64 \text{ cookies left}
    \]

The first 2 have 100 apartments each and the last one is 35% bigger than the other 2 combined. However, this week, 9 apartments from each of the first 2 complexes were vacant and did not require collection service. Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week from each place and he gets paid ₣0.5 per collection for each apartment. He also earns an additional 10% in tips. How much money does he make in a week?",1243.0,"To calculate how much money Oscar makes in a week, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of apartments in each complex.**
   - The first two complexes each have 100 apartments.
   - The total number of apartments in the first two complexes is:
     \[
     100 + 100 = 200 \text{ apartments}
     \]
   - The last complex is 35% bigger than the first two combined. Therefore, the number of apartments in the last complex is:
     \[
     200 + (0.35 \times 200) = 200 + 70 = 270 \text{ apartments}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of apartments.**
   - The total number of apartments across all three complexes is:
     \[
     200 + 270 = 470 \text{ apartments}
     \]

3. **Account for the vacant apartments.**
   - There are 9 vacant apartments in each of the first two complexes, so the total number of vacant apartments is:
     \[
     9 + 9 = 18 \text{ vacant apartments}
     \]
   - The number of apartments that require collection service is:
     \[
     470 - 18 = 452 \text{ apartments}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of collections per week.**
   - Oscar collects garbage 5 times a week, so the total number of collections for the week is:
     \[
     452 \text{ apartments} \times 5 \text{ collections/week} = 2260 \text{ collections}
     \]

5. **Calculate the earnings from collections.**
   - Oscar earns ₣0.5 per collection, so his earnings from collections for the week are:
     \[
     2260 \text{ collections} \times 0.5 \text{ ₣/collection} = 1130 \text{ ₣}

1. **Calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:**
   - The first complex has 100 apartments.
   - The second complex also has 100 apartments.
   - So, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is 100 + 100 = 200 apartments.

2. **Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex:**
   - The third complex is 35% bigger than the first two combined.
   - The size of the first two complexes combined is 200 apartments.
   - 35% of 200 is calculated as follows: 
     \[
     0.35 \times 200 = 70
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is:
     \[
     200 + 70 = 270 \text{ apartments}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of apartments Oscar collects from:**
   - The first two complexes have 100 apartments each, but 9 are vacant in each.
   - So, the number of apartments requiring service in the first complex is:
     \[
     100 - 9 = 91
     \]
   - The number of apartments requiring service in the second complex is also:
     \[
     100 - 9 = 91

How much would a 60-minute call cost?",24.0,"To calculate the cost of a 60-minute call from the phone booth, we will break it down into three segments based on the pricing structure:

1. **First 10 minutes**: 
   - Cost per minute: ₺0.8
   - Total cost for 10 minutes: 
     \[
     10 \text{ minutes} \times ₺0.8/\text{minute} = ₺8.0

2. **Next 30 minutes (from minute 11 to minute 40)**: 
   - Cost per minute: ₺0.7
   - Total cost for 30 minutes: 
     \[
     30 \text{ minutes} \times ₺0.7/\text{minute} = ₺21.0

   - The percentage of time spent cleaning is given by the ratio of cleaning time to total working time:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Cleaning time}}{\text{Total working time}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{40 \text{ hours}}{80 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 50\%
     \]

Thus, the janitor spends **50%** of their day cleaning rooms.",50.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. The janitor has to clean a total of 200 rooms.
2. Originally, it takes them 6 minutes to clean one room. However, due to their injury, it now takes them twice as long:
   \[
   6 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 12 \text{ minutes per room}
   \]
3. To find out how long it will take to clean all 200 rooms, we multiply the time per room by the total number of rooms:
   \[
   200 \text{ rooms} \times 12 \text{ minutes per room} = 2400 \text{ minutes}
   \]
4. Next, we convert the total cleaning time from minutes to hours:
   \[
   2400 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 40 \text{ hours}
   \]
5. The janitor works for 8 hours a day. To find out how many days it will take to clean all the rooms, we divide the total hours by the hours worked per day:
   \[
   40 \text{ hours} \div 8 \text{ hours per day} = 5 \text{ days}
   \]
6. Now, we need to find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning rooms. Since they work 8 hours a day, we first find out how many hours they spend cleaning each day:
   \[
   \text{Hours spent cleaning per day} = \frac{40 \text{ hours}}{5 \text{ days}} = 8 \text{ hours per day}
   \]
7. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Hours spent cleaning}}{\text{Total hours in a day}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 100\%
   \]

[Example Input]
Question: A gardener has to tend to a park with 150 plants. They have 5 days to complete the task. It takes them 4 minutes per plant. However, due to a recent illness, the gardener has become slower and it will take them 1.5 times longer to tend to each plant now. If they work for 6 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent tending to the plants?

Wrong answer: I calculated that it takes 4 minutes per plant, so for 150 plants, it would take 600 minutes. I then divided that by 6 hours (360 minutes) and got approximately 1.67, which I interpreted as 167% of their day spent working.

---
[Example Output]
Explanation:
I miscalculated the total time needed to tend to the plants by not accounting for the increased time per plant due to the gardener's illness. I should have multiplied the original time by 1.5 to find the correct time per plant.

Error Keywords:
- Miscalculation
- Time management
- Percentage calculation

Instructions:
1. Determine the original time per plant.
2. Adjust the time per plant based on any changes (e.g., illness or injury).
3. Calculate the total time needed for all plants.
4. Convert the total time into hours if necessary.
5. Determine the total available working time in hours.
6. Calculate the percentage of the working day spent on the task by dividing the total time spent by the total available time and multiplying by 100.

Advice:
- Always double-check any adjustments to time or rates before calculating totals.
- Be careful with percentage calculations; ensure you are comparing the correct values.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid confusion.

Solution:
The gardener takes 4 minutes per plant, but due to illness, it now takes 4 minutes * 1.5 = 6 minutes per plant. For 150 plants, the total time is 150 * 6 = 900 minutes. In hours, this is 900 / 60 = 15 hours. The gardener works for 6 hours a day, so over 5 days, they work a total of 30 hours. The percentage of their day spent working is (15 hours / 30 hours) * 100 = 50%. Thus, the gardener spends 50% of their day tending to the plants.

   \]
3. **Calculate the total time needed for all rooms**: For 200 rooms, the total time is:
   \[
   200 \text{ rooms} \times 12 \text{ minutes per room} = 2400 \text{ minutes}
   \]
4. **Convert the total time into hours**: 
   \[
   2400 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 40 \text{ hours}
   \]
5. **Determine the total available working time**: The janitor works for 8 hours a day for 10 days, so:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours/day} \times 10 \text{ days} = 80 \text{ hours}

As the skillet of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 70 pop in the first 10 seconds of cooking, then 2 times that amount in the next 10 seconds. The kernels increase to 4 times the initial popping rate in the next 10 seconds. In the final 10 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 10 seconds. After Noah takes the skillet off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. Noah gives one-fifth of the made popcorn to his brother Luca. How many more pieces of popcorn does Noah have to eat than his brother?",399.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Popping in the first 10 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels popped = 70

2. **Popping in the next 10 seconds:**
   - This is 2 times the amount of the first 10 seconds.
   - Number of kernels popped = \( 2 \times 70 = 140 \)

3. **Popping in the next 10 seconds:**
   - This is 4 times the initial popping rate (which is 70).
   - Number of kernels popped = \( 4 \times 70 = 280 \)

4. **Popping in the final 10 seconds:**
   - This is half the rate of the previous 10 seconds (which was 280).
   - Number of kernels popped = \( \frac{280}{2} = 140 \)

5. **Total kernels popped during cooking:**
   - Total = \( 70 + 140 + 280 + 140 \)
   - Total = \( 630 \)

6. **Kernels that pop from residual heat:**
   - A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds (which was 140).
   - Number of kernels popped = \( \frac{140}{4} = 35 \)

7. **Total kernels popped including residual heat:**
   - Total = \( 630 + 35 = 665 \)

8. **Popcorn given to Luca:**
   - Noah gives one-fifth of the total popcorn to his brother Luca.
   - Number of kernels given to Luca = \( \frac{665}{5} = 133 \)

9. **Kernels Noah has left:**
   - Number of kernels Noah has = \( 665 - 133 = 532 \)

10. **Difference in the number of pieces of popcorn:**
    - Difference = \( 532 - 133 = 399 \)

Thus, Noah has **399 more pieces of popcorn** to eat than his brother Luca.",399.0,1,"Let's think step by step.

1. In the first 10 seconds, 70 kernels pop.
2. In the next 10 seconds, the amount that pops is 2 times the first amount:
   - 2 * 70 = 140 kernels.
3. In the following 10 seconds, the popping rate increases to 4 times the initial rate:
   - 4 * 70 = 280 kernels.
4. In the final 10 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate of the previous 10 seconds:
   - Half of 280 = 280 / 2 = 140 kernels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the cooking:

- Total popped = 70 + 140 + 280 + 140 = 630 kernels.

5. After taking the skillet off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds also pop:
   - A quarter of 140 = 140 / 4 = 35 kernels.

Now, let's add this to the total popped:

- Total kernels after residual heat = 630 + 35 = 665 kernels.

6. Noah gives one-fifth of the made popcorn to his brother Luca:
   - One-fifth of 665 = 665 / 5 = 133 kernels.

If there are 30 bricks in the building in total, what percentage of bricks are green?",50.0,"To find the percentage of green bricks in the building, we first need to determine the number of each type of brick.

1. **Identify the number of white bricks:**
   - There are 5 white bricks.

2. **Determine the number of orange bricks:**
   - The problem states there are twice as many orange bricks as white bricks. Therefore, the number of orange bricks is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ orange bricks}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of white and orange bricks:**
   - The total number of white and orange bricks is:
   \[
   5 \text{ (white)} + 10 \text{ (orange)} = 15 \text{ bricks}
   \]

4. **Find the total number of bricks in the building:**
   - The total number of bricks in the building is given as 30.

5. **Calculate the number of green bricks:**
   - To find the number of green bricks, we subtract the total number of white and orange bricks from the total number of bricks:
   \[
   30 \text{ (total)} - 15 \text{ (white and orange)} = 15 \text{ green bricks}
